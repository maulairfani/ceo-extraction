Aluminium is considered to be the material of the future as it has a tremendous potential to become a key material of a carbon-neutral and circular world. Aluminium is a game changer for the automotive industry, supporting the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, and resulting in enhanced fuel savings and safety. The material also plays a vital role in the fast-evolving sustainable construction sector and green buildings. It is a key material for the healthcare sector, from medical equipment and oxygen bottles to drug packaging. Moreover, its hygienic properties and the need to drastically reduce the use of plastics increase the already important role of aluminium in the packaging and beverage industries. En+ Group remains strongly committed to leading the 'hard to abate' aluminium industry into the green economy via nine key initiatives, stated in the Group's Green Aluminium Vision published in July 2020.\n\n## How this contributes to a green economy\n\nWe lead the way to decarbonisation with our 'low-carbon' aluminium products, ALLOW, that help customers achieve emissions reduction targets and contribute to more transparent climate disclosure. Aluminium is widely recycled, making it a 'greener' material, and supporting global sustainability efforts. Its lightness and high recyclability contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of entire value chains and to scaling up the circular economy model. To lead the industry into the lowcarbon economy, we aim to develop a new asset class of 'Green Aluminium' - a strategic material for a future-proof sustainable economy which includes low-carbon primary aluminium and recycled aluminium. We actively engage in the global discussion around the future of the aluminium industry and the growing demand for low-carbon aluminium, and are supporters of the London Metal Exchange's (LME) platform for the implementation of mandatory reporting on carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\np. 32 Business review\n\nRead more about our green vision in our manifesto 'The Green Aluminium Vision'",

This also allows the Group to engage in all major areas of the Russian power industry and makes En+ the largest independent hydropower producer globally.\n\nOur Power segment is also investing in R&D in the power generating sector, including the development of new types of perovskite-based solar panels. We continuously undertake investment projects to improve the reliability and safety of the Group's hydropower plants, and increase the amount of energy produced from the same volumes of water passing through the hydropower turbines.\n\n## How this contributes to a green economy\n\nHydropower produces roughly 70% of all renewable electricity worldwide. Hydropower plants do not emit CO 2 in the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions, making it a carbon-free source of energy. We use this clean energy source to produce low-carbon and recyclable aluminium - ALLOW - with a certified carbon footprint.

Cost control focus is one of our strategic objectives and En+ runs ongoing cost optimisation initiatives across the Group. The Group's reliance on hydropower provides for exceptional financial efficiency. The combination with thermal power generation supports the fundamentals of En+ Group, providing additional revenue streams. Our Metals segment is among the three most cost-effective aluminium producers in the world, with RUSAL continuing to implement a comprehensive programme designed to control costs and optimise the production process. Costs in the Metals segment are minimised through long-term power and transport contracts, and by achieving full bauxite and nepheline selfsufficiency in the medium term. In-house R&D, engineering and design capabilities enable the Metals segment to develop new technologies that help to streamline production and cut capital and operation costs. Cost efficiency enables En+ to achieve better EBITDA margins, in line with leading levels for the industry globally.\n\n## How this contributes to a green economy\n\nA substantial degree of vertical integration provides En+ Group with significant advantages and additional sources of growth. It also supports the Group's longer-term vision of a low-carbon world. Our investments in the modernisation of hydropower plants and environmental upgrades of our Metals segment's facilities further support a sustainable economy.

        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders,\n\nFor all of us, 2020 was a testing and challenging year. At the En+ Group we have long benefited from the resilience of our vertically integrated business model, but 2020 was an extraordinary testament to the resilience of our outstanding employees, both in Russia and right around the world.\n\nSafeguarding our employees, customers and communities was our number one priority during the year. I will explain in more detail the actions we took, but first I will highlight our strong business performance in 2020.\n\nIn a year of exceptional uncertainty caused by COVID-19, our Company demonstrated robust operational results against a backdrop of volatile prices and fluctuating economic trends. We benefited from our continuing strategic investment programme which reinforces our position as a global leader in low-carbon aluminium production and hydropower generation. Our commitment to lead the aluminium industry into the low-carbon economy, together with our world-class corporate governance, our focus on health & safety and our constant drive to improve efficiency, helped the En+ Group continue to enhance its appeal to investors and wider stakeholders.\n\n## Solid foundations provide strength in a challenging year\n\nChallenging conditions and economic restrictions as a result of the pandemic impacted the Group's markets across the globe. New outbreaks and increasing numbers of cases stifled recovery trends, affecting our customers' businesses and leading to sharp movements in both demand and prices for aluminium. However, our Group's business model, our unique asset base and the efficiency of our operations meant we had solid foundations from which to face this turmoil. Meanwhile, crisis mitigation plans swiftly implemented by our leadership team successfully prevented any material impact by COVID-19 on the Group's operations.\n\nDuring the year our Power segment increased low-carbon power generation at its HPPs due to favourable hydrological conditions. Aluminium production remained stable and we maintained effectively full production capacity utilisation. As well as our foundational strengths, we benefited from new and innovative approaches to marketing which led to better geographical diversification of sales and a high proportion of value-added products.\n\n## Our people and our communities\n\nThe Group has almost 90,000 employees across four continents and I am grateful to every single one of them for rising to the challenge of the last year. Their commitment, skills and resilience have supported and carried the Company through these difficult times and their flexibility and ingenuity has enabled us to continue to work efficiently and successfully.\n\nThe welfare of our En+ family was paramount as the pandemic emerged during the year. Among our first steps was to move more than 15,000 officebased staff to work from home. For those essential employees whose roles meant they could not work remotely, strict health and sanitation measures were implemented which complemented and enhanced our existing stringent health and safety protocols.\n\nWe also took very seriously our duty to the wider communities and regions in which we operate across the globe. We delivered food parcels to more than 16,000 elderly and retired employees in Russia and provided funding for healthcare services in Irkutsk where we provided medical equipment and PPE to seven hospitals, healthcare institutions and social services. In Kindia, Guinea we converted the Centre for Epidemic and Microbiological Research and Treatment into the country's first specialist COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment centre.\n\nI am proud of the bravery and achievements of our people during an unprecedented year and thank them for all they have done. I am also proud that En+ Group was able to show such strong corporate purpose, reflecting our belief that responsible businesses are vital to achieving a stronger and more sustainable world. And I send my own sincere condolences to all employees, stakeholders and members of their families who have lost loved ones to this terrible pandemic.\n\n## Corporate governance to the fore\n\nFor a business to be responsible it must also adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance. It must act for the benefit of all stakeholders in a transparent and open manner.\n\n'Build back better' was a major theme in 2020, and one which we fully endorse. Countries and responsible businesses are motivated more than ever to take action that will look after our planet after the pandemic. Collaboration of all types will be increasingly important to drive sector and industry progress towards meeting the Paris climate targets. In 2020 I signed the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) backed CEO statement on 'Uniting Business and Governments to Recover Better', the largest ever UNGC backed climate advocacy initiative to urge governments to match private sector ambitions and commit to a net zero recovery from COVID-19.",

        "page_content": "The En+ Group also led a proactive campaign for low-carbon aluminium to help power Europe's COVID-19 recovery package and the European Union's climate transition strategy, which is threatened by the use of dangerously polluting high-carbon metals.\n\nWe are working hard engaging with regulators and other key decision makers in major aluminium markets to take measures that will incentivise producers to reduce the carbon footprint of their metals. I am proud that we are setting a new standard in this respect.\n\nIn January 2021 En+ Group announced its ambition to become net zero by 2050 and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 35% by 2030. We believe those are the boldest carbon reduction targets yet seen in the global aluminium industry. This is our contribution to helping turn the tide on climate change. Greater transparency across the sector would further support this; empowering metals consumers and even endproduct purchasers to choose, and drive demand for, products made with sustainably produced metals. To have a real impact, net zero strategies must drive right the way down supply chains.\n\nThe past year has taught us to never take anything for granted. But, during that time the performance of the En+ Group has been considerable and again, I thank all our people who have made that possible. We will continue to invest in world-beating research and development, improve the efficiency and productivity of our assets, innovate, and identify new markets. The work we have done in the last year has further strengthened our foundations and positioned us for future growth.\n\nHaving undergone comprehensive restructuring and updated its governance, En+ Group has proven its commitment to world class corporate governance standards, having a clear majority of Board\n\npositions occupied by highly experienced independent nonexecutive directors. Their exceptional guidance and counsel has proven invaluable during the last year and I am grateful for all their work.\n\nVery sadly, one of our colleagues, Independent Non-Executive Director Dr Igor Lojevsky, lost his life to the pandemic during the year. He is greatly missed by all those of us who were privileged to know him.\n\nDuring the year the Company moved to simplify its ownership structure with an innovative transaction which saw it acquire VTB Group's stake in En+ Group. We believe this action, together with the final completion of Glencore securities swap, which also happened in early 2020, further enhances the Company's attractiveness as an investment. The acquisition of shares from VTB also provides us with greater strategic optionality, subject to market conditions, to increase En+ Group's free float, thereby broadening institutional ownership and improving trading liquidity.\n\nI am pleased that throughout 2020, and despite the challenges of remote working and travel restrictions, we maintained strong engagement with our stakeholders, including our customers, industry partners and also our investors. We continued to be recognised by ESG ratings agencies for both our sustainable business and approach, and our transparency - our Metals business receiving the top 'A' rating from CDP in December in recognition of climate risk mitigation across our entire supply chain was a particular highlight.\n\n## A leader of the low-carbon economy\n\nAs well as striving to ensure our own operations are as green and efficient as possible, En+ Group has a mission to lead its industry in sustainability and help drive the world towards a low-carbon future. Low-carbon aluminium is a crucial building block for\n\nthe low-carbon economy. It is strong, durable, infinitely recyclable and adaptable for a range of industries from packaging and sustainable construction to electric vehicles and renewable energy. As an industry we need to make the transition to the low-carbon economy as simple and compelling as possible for our customers. That is why we have called for comprehensive labelling and universal standards for the carbon footprint of primary aluminium.\n\nDuring 2020, the London Metal Exchange proposed voluntary disclosure of carbon-related metrics for aluminium and the launching of a new spot trading platform for low-carbon aluminium. While this was an important step forward, we feel the proposals did not go far enough. So we will continue to champion mandatory carbon emission disclosures as the only way to ensure total transparency for buyers.\n\nWhile there are some encouraging signs that the pandemic is in retreat, with our confidence in the improved outlook for our business reflected in the intention to reinstate dividend payments in 2021, there will inevitably be setbacks and the economic environment will continue to remain volatile as countries around the world plan their post-COVID-19 recovery.\n\nBut COVID-19 is not the only challenge. Tackling climate change has never been more important and this year's COP26 summit, which will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is a vitally important event to which we will add our voice.\n\nAs the world builds back better from COVID-19 En+ Group is uniquely placed - and ready - to provide the materials and energy needed for a sustainable low-carbon recovery, while building and growing value for our shareholders.\n\n## Rt Hon Lord Barker of Battle,\n\nExecutive Chairman",

We are unique among natural resources companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Power generation capabilities\n\nIn our power generating business, the Group is developing perovskite solar cell technology, a new generation of photovoltaics. We use hydropower from Siberian rivers to create low-carbon aluminium. We promote sciencebased analysis in order to address the Baikal issues correctly and in the most efficient ways, we joined forces with the leading Russian academics. The collaboration spans from the analysis of the contamination of the lake to creating new forecasting algorithms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Power\n\n## Personal goods\n\nAccording to IEA, renewable capacity additions are on track for a record expansion of nearly 10% in 2021. With this soaring growth, cable industry expects increased demand for high and extrahigh voltage cable where aluminium is consumed. Europacable estimates this cable demand will reach 90,000 km driving up more than 150 billion investment by 2030. 'Green' aluminium is key to support this upswing in growing 'green' energy capacities, so that they can flow through 'green' cables.\n\nIn this segment, leading producers of electronics, beauty products, and other consumer goods, are becoming increasingly mindful of the lifecycle impacts of their products. This segment is tangibly close to the end consumers who become more selective with carbon footprint of the goods they purchase. Personal goods market has seen an upswing of carbon-neutral and environmentally friendly brands linked to corporate carbon neutrality/carbon negative commitments. Being able to measure the footprint of raw materials, including aluminium, is key in this regard.\n\n## The En+ approach\n\nThe pure form of aluminium does not naturally occur in nature, so it remained largely unknown until as recently as 200 years ago. Creating aluminium using electricity was first developed in 1886 and is still used to this day. Today, the Company views its work on innovation as an investment in the future. The Company performs vast research and development activities to introduce environmentally friendly technologies into production cycles to save resources and reduce costs.\n\n## Applications of low-carbon aluminium\n\nSince 2017, RUSAL offers customers ALLOW, its proprietary brand of lowcarbon aluminium, crafted with renewable hydropower. ALLOW comes with average carbon footprint of 2.4 t CO 2 e/t Al (Scope 1&2, at smelter). This is in line with the evolving market requirement for low-carbon aluminium of no more than 4 t CO 2 eq/t Al, which is several times lower than the global average of around 12.5 t (Scope 1&2, at smelter).\n\nTo ensure transparency, every shipment of ALLOW comes with independently verified carbon footprint statements from its smelter of origin, providing full traceability to source for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww .enplusgroup.com/en/ what-we-do/metals-segment/allow/",

        "page_content": "## The advantages of low-carbon aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abundant\n\nAluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up 8%. After iron, it is the most widely used metal in the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aluminium refining and production facilities\n\nWe are working to develop our inert anode technology, which has the potential to drastically reduce the emissions associated with aluminium production. Inert anodes replace standard carbon anodes with inert, non-consumable materials ceramics or alloys, which results in a reduction of emissions from the smelting process. Another breakthrough advantage of this technology is the release of oxygen in the process of producing aluminium. One cell using inert anode technology can generate the same volume of oxygen as 70 hectares of forest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aerospace and aviation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conductive  and reflective\n\nAluminium is an effective conductor of both heat and electricity. In relation to its weight, it is twice as conductive as copper and reflects 98% of infrared rays.\n\n## 85%\n\nIn comparison to full-scope industry average emissions, metal produced with inert anodes has an 85% lower carbon footprint.\n\n## Corrosion-resistant and impermeable\n\nUnlike iron which rusts, aluminium oxide sticks to the original metal, shielding it from corrosion. It is also highly impermeable so serves as a barrier for light, aroma, moisture and contamination.\n\n## +50%\n\nWe have already achieved a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with aluminium production of more than 50% compared to 1990 levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Packaging\n\n## Automotive\n\nAluminium-intensive vehicles have 13% lower life cycle CO 2 emissions VS steel vehicles. Low-carbon aluminium further reduces life cycle emissions by 17%. ALLOW is a reliable partner for the emerging e-mobility and related infrastructure. What's more, there is future potential for aluminium-ion batteries.\n\nLight, durable, stackable, resistant to transportation, and - what is most important - almost infinitely recyclable, aluminium is a key enabler of reduced lifecycle impacts in the packaging sector. For example, CAGR in cans market in the next 5 years is set to exceed 2%. Low-carbon footprint and broader ESG credentials of RUSAL's aluminium position our products to support this growth.\n\n## Construction\n\nUse of low-carbon aluminium can reduce embodied carbon of buildings by up to 20%. In commercial buildings with traditional structures and aluminium parts made with low-carbon aluminium can reduce footprint by 7%.\n\nLight, strong and flexible, it proved an ideal material for building heavier-thanair aircraft. All modern spacecraft contain from 50% to 90% of aluminium alloys in their parts. Aluminium is used in the body of Space Shuttle vehicles, it is found in the telescopic antenna of the Hubble space telescope; hydrogen tanks used in rockets are made from aluminium, the tips of rockets use aluminium, as well as parts of launch vehicles, orbital stations, the fastening units for solar panels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Infinitely recycable and durable\n\nAluminium retains its quality when recycled, making it almost endlessly recycable without degradation of core properties. Approximately 75% of all the aluminium ever made is still in use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lightweight\n\nAluminium is extremely ductile and weighs a third of steel or copper, making it idea for bodywork of modern vehicles which require lightweight components for energy efficiency.",

At the beginning of the year we saw border closures, we saw our customers shut down certain facilities, and imposed transport restrictions and reduced economic activity threatened the financial and operational performance of our business. Despite this we have remained resilient and continued to demonstrate industry leadership.\n\nOur biggest challenge and our priority throughout the year has been maintaining the safety of our people. The majority of our employees began working remotely from March and I am pleased to say that this relatively seamless transition was supported by our superior IT systems, and also the flexibility and resourcefulness of all of my colleagues, to whom I am very grateful. As we provide energy for homes and businesses across Siberia, it has been essential that our hydropower plants continue to operate; similarly, our smelters cannot be left unattended.\n\nFor those colleagues needed to man these operations on site, we established comprehensive systems to ensure they remained safe from infection and that any outbreaks could be safely controlled. We have been very fortunate in being able safely to maintain our operations at up to full capacity throughout 2020.\n\nWhilst taking every measure to keep our workforce safe, we also recognised our commitment to our customers and worked very hard to maintain deliveries to our sales markets across the world throughout this time.\n\n## A resilient performance in challenging times\n\nI am proud to say that despite the numerous challenges related to the pandemic, En+ Group delivered a solid performance for the year. Our aluminium production remained stable and we increased sales of value-added products by 11% as compared to a year ago. The Power segment increased electricity output by 6%, and our HPP output increased by 8%. Our fully vertically-integrated model proved its resilience, and we continued to benefit from the combination of our unique",

In spite of the exceptional circumstances, we were able to maintain our leading position as the world's largest producer of low-carbon aluminium.\n\nIn response to the challenging market environment caused by COVID-19, the Metals segment successfully adjusted its sales mix, with a material increase in sales to geographies where demand was stronger, and an increase in VAP sales to 44% of total sales, accompanied by an 8% increase in realised premiums. The end of 2020 was marked by a recovery in global aluminium demand, with a positive impact on aluminium prices. Aluminium prices ended the year above $2,000/t, compared to an LME average price of $1,702/t over 2020.\n\n## Continuing to invest for the sustainable future\n\nWe also continued to make progress in key strategic areas, including investments to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of our operations and ongoing innovations that will help us reduce the carbon footprint of our aluminium even further.\n\nIn 2020 we continued our comprehensive New Energy programme, modernising our HPPs on the Angara and Yenisei cascade. We were able to reduce emissions further whilst increasing hydropower production. The upgraded equipment at the Group's Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk and Krasnoyarsk HPPs supported an increase in hydropower production of 454.2 GWh in 4Q 2020 (1,712.1 GWh in 2020), helping to prevent greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 526 thousand tonnes of CO 2 e, due to the partial replacement of prior thermal power generation volumes (1,984 thousand tonnes of CO 2 e for the full year 2020). In November we announced the completed replacement of Hydroelectric Unit No.2 at our Irkutsk HPP, resulting in an increased capacity of 105.7 MW, compared to the previous capacity of 82.8 MW. The ongoing modernisation of our HPPs' equipment will increase their efficiency, reduce the cost of repair work, and improve the\n\nperformance of the units and stations in general. We expect the New Energy programme to result in a reduction to the Group's greenhouse gas emissions of 2.3 million tonnes per year by 2022.\n\nIn our Metals segment - where our ALLOW low-carbon aluminium brand continues to grow - we announced plans to invest in modernising the Sayanogorsk and Khakas aluminium smelters to ensure their continued high-quality sustainable production.\n\nWe have maintained our commitment to innovation throughout this period as this is critical to helping us and the industry at large make a step change in our contribution to the Paris climate goals. We announced plans to completely switch the reduction area of the Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter to a new type of raw material, an eco-friendly pitch. During the year Krasnoyarsk also completed its transition to Eco-S\u00f8derberg technology. It also began testing a pilot industrial electrolytic cell with inert anodes, which completely eliminates emissions of greenhouse gases (CO and CO 2 ), polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene and sulphur from the reduction process. Another positive result of this unique technology is generating oxygen in the aluminium production process. This process is a game changer for our industry, making carbon emissions-free aluminium production a genuine possibility.\n\nWe plan to continue with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certification of our facilities, in our drive to provide our customers and stakeholders with as much transparency as possible. A further five of the Group's aluminium smelters were successfully certified to meet the ASI standards.\n\nWe also explored new sales opportunities. We launched a new foundry complex at the Boguchany aluminium smelter; with an annual capacity of 120 thousand tonnes, it will produce advanced alloys, which are in high demand by the automotive industry globally. We also announced\n\na partnership with BitRiver, operator of the largest data centre offering colocation services for bitcoin mining in Russia, to form Bit+, a joint venture for mining cryptocurrencies at low cost with a low-carbon footprint. The first phase of Bit+'s new facility, with 10 MW of electricity committed by En+, is currently operational, with plans to scale the facility to approximately 40 MW.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe global COVID-19 situation remains unpredictable in the near term, and our key priorities remain unchanged: these are the health and safety of our workforce, maintaining uninterrupted operations at our facilities and continuing to fulfil our contractual obligations. In light of the current circumstances, it is critical that En+ Group continues to demonstrate operational stability and the resilience of its business model.\n\nWe remain confident in the fundamental long-term drivers for demand for our low-carbon aluminium. The trend towards sustainable infrastructure has strengthened as the COVID-19 pandemic brought into focus for all the fragility of the world around us. We are ideally positioned to help all of our customers meet more ambitious decarbonisation targets as we offer them a sustainable, traceable and entirely transparent raw material in our low-carbon aluminium.\n\n## Vladimir Kiriukhin,\n\nChief Executive Officer",

        "page_content": "## Metals segment review\n\n## Market overview 1\n\n## Global aluminium demand\n\nIn 2020, countries grappled with supply chain disruptions and severe contractions in economic activity, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world. In the aluminium industry, this sparked a drop in end-use demand in all major economies with the exception of China. Moreover, the pandemic became the key driver of change in government policies, which are now in turn accelerating green technology shifts and amplifying the trends that have been evolving within the aluminium industry over a number of years. The evolution of these trends now look set to quicken demand recovery in 2021 and will drive growth in aluminium use over the long term.\n\nGlobal manufacturing continued its recovery in December despite the latest wave of the pandemic. December's PMIs revealed that advanced economy manufacturing was still expanding. Global PMI remained at a level of 53.8 in December, unchanged month-over-month. Meanwhile, a weaker dollar, strong manufacturing data, positive news on the development of COVID-19 vaccines and expectations of a US economic stimulus package continued to support commodity prices. In December, the aluminium price continued to trade above the USD 2000/tonne level.\n\nFor the full year 2020, global aluminium demand was down by 1.7% YoY to 63.9 mt, improving from a 2.6% decline YoY during 9M 2020. Rest of the World ex-China ('RoW') demand contracted by 8.9% to 26.0 mt, however China offset this with continuous robust demand, demonstrating strong growth of 3.9% to 37.9 mt.\n\nIn 2020, the largest end-user segment of aluminium was construction, decreasing by 4% year-on-year. The construction sector displayed resilience during the pandemic with construction sites in general less impacted by lockdown closures than other industries. Regional differences were significant, however, meaning China's strong levels of consumption were key in softening the effect of sharper falls in demand seen in areas such as South America. COVID-19-induced stimulus packages were further positive news for infrastructure investment worldwide and aluminium use within the industry. The environmentally oriented part of these packages will see more resources directed specifically into green construction technologies where aluminium is often the material of choice.\n\nLockdowns, supply shortages and diminished demand weighed heavily on the automotive sector, which saw both aluminium demand and light vehicle production contract 17% YoY in 2020. This was a considerably sharper fall in demand than observed in all other key industries and the automotive sector consequently lost its position as the largest consuming sector of aluminium products for the first time in 6 years. Whilst the decline in vehicle output impacted heavily on aluminium demand, changes in consumer choice, emissions targets and green recovery packages favour growth in the use of aluminium in automotive manufacture over the longer term. As preferences drive a growing share of SUV type vehicles in vehicle production overall, the demand for lightweight solutions increases in order to meet ever more stringent CO 2 emission targets. Moreover, recovery packages incentivise EV sales, where aluminium finds additional applications within space frames and battery enclosures.\n\nPackaging sector demand remained robust throughout the year, with aluminium semi-finished product consumption falling by just 1% year-on-year in 2020. This resilience was the consequence of a series of unexpected upsides from the pandemic, such as a spike in demand for aluminium-containing pharmaceutical packaging. Moreover, lockdowns shifted consumer eating behaviours that led to an increase in demand for at home foils and cans. A clear example of this included North America, where a surge in beverage can usage left can producers struggling to satisfy demand. Lastly, aluminium substitution continued to benefit from its 'sustainable' image and ease of recycling, the backlash against single-use plastic packaging and the heightened environmental awareness of consumers. Consequently, the substitution of glass (beer) and PET (soft drinks) with aluminium cans accelerated, with US aluminium can sheet demand to grow at a healthy 5-6% CAGR over the next five years according to Harbor.\n\nFinally, aluminium end-use demand within the electrical sector fell by 4% year-on-year in 2020, after the pandemic caused disruption to power infrastructure projects and supply chains. The year did however see the announcement of several new national CO 2 emission targets and green stimulus packages that look set to drive the transition of energy acquisition to renewable sources faster and sooner. With the installation of renewable power sources such as solar and wind often requiring high voltage aluminium transmission cables, a positive impact on aluminium demand over the coming years is anticipated.",

        "page_content": "## Global aluminium supply, inventories and premiums\n\nGlobal aluminium production in 2020 grew by 2.3% to 65.3 mt, taking into account minimal RoW growth of 0.2% year-on-year to 28.0 mt and 3.9% growth YoY in China, to 37.2 mt. Overall, the global market had a surplus of 1.4 mt during 2020.\n\nOperating capacity in China exceeded 38.7 mt. Chinese unwrought aluminium/alloys and products exports declined by 15.2% YoY to 4.84 mt in 2020, while unwrought aluminium imports during 2020 amounted to around 1.06 mt vs. 75 thousand tonnes for 2019. This shift followed a strongly negative export price arbitrage and reduced demand overseas due to the pandemic. China is thus becoming an important balancing force for the global aluminium industry, absorbing excessive supply from the RoW markets.\n\nIn 2020, aluminium inventories at LME warehouses declined by ~133 thousand tonnes to 1.34 mt. LME live warrants increased to a level of 1.19 mt. Chinese regional stocks moved in a downward trend over the period April to December and fell by 1.06 mt to a total of 0.61 mt from their highest level this year of 1.68 mt at the beginning of April 2020. Chinese regional inventories remained at a seasonally low level at 682 thousand tonnes by the end of 2020.\n\nBy the end of 2020 aluminium premiums had risen in the US, Europe and Asia, with strong demand fundamentals and aluminium scrap shortage outside of China supporting a further increase in demand for primary metal.\n\nIn 1H 2020 VAP market demand reduced drastically, due to fall of end-use demand from key consumer industries that followed widespread lockdown measures. But by the end of 2020 on the back of stock replenishment across whole supply chain, postponed end-use demand and positive expectations regarding market conditions in 2021, VAP demand almost returned to pre-crisis level. VAP supply adjusted through the year in line with general market circumstances - during 1H 2020 producers switched to primary aluminium production. And this has further contributed to primary aluminium stockpiling during this period.\n\n## Aluminium market outlook\n\nLooking ahead to 2021, demand for primary aluminium is estimated to grow by 5-6%. The speed of vaccine rollouts, success of government stimulus packages and the ability to contain outbreaks are each expected to have significant impacts on global aluminium demand. Over the long term, the acceleration of green technology trends will help drive aluminium demand over the coming years. The global market is expected to move into a small deficit in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company's core asset base is located in Siberia, Russia and accounts for approximately 93% of the Company's aluminium output in 2020. Among those, BrAZ and KrAZ together account for more than half of RUSAL's aluminium production. The Company owns an 85% stake in a smelter located in Nigeria.\n\nIn March 2019, the launch of the second part of the first stage of the Boguchany (BEMO) project brought the total production capacity to almost 300 thousand tonnes per annum.\n\nThe Group's primary aluminium production for the year ended 31 December 2020 was stable as compared to the previous year and totalled 3,755 kt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alumina\n\nThe Group owns nine alumina refineries as of the end of 2020. RUSAL's alumina refineries are located in six countries: Ireland (one plant), Jamaica (two plants, one legal entity), Ukraine (one plant), Italy (one plant), Russia (four plants), and Guinea (one plant). In addition, the Company holds a 20% equity stake in QAL, an alumina refinery located in Australia.\n\nSince February 2020, anti-COVID measures were taken to control and prevent the spread of the disease at all plants, some of which are still in place. Thanks to these efficient and prompt managerial actions there has been no substantial change in production schedules or finished goods output.\n\nThe Company's long position in alumina capacity secures sufficient supply for existing production and the prospective expansion of the Company's aluminium production capacity, and allows the Company to take advantage of favourable market conditions through third-party alumina sales.\n\nRUSAL's total attributable alumina output was 8,182 kt in 2020 and 7,858 kt in 2019. Production volume increase by 4% due to enhancement of equipment operations at Achinsk Alumina Refinery, stabilisation of production process at Windalco and Friguia Alumina Refinery, output increase at Queensland Alumina Limited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bauxites and nephelines\n\nBauxites and nephelines are key raw materials for alumina production. In 2020, the Group was approximately 80% self-sufficient in bauxites and nephelines.\n\n## Bauxites\n\nThe Group operates seven bauxite mines. RUSAL's bauxite mines are located in four countries: Russia (two mines), Jamaica (one mine), Guyana (one mine), and Guinea (three mines). The Company's long position in bauxite capacity helps secure sufficient supply for existing operations and the prospective expansion of the Company's alumina production capacity. In addition, the Group sells low volumes of bauxite to third parties.\n\n- 1 Nine aluminium smelters in operation (Alscon, located in Nigeria, aluminium operation is mothballed).\n- 2  Pro-rata share of production attributable to the Group.",

The suspension and mothballing of operations of the Bauxite Company of Guyana (BCGI) resulted from serious illegitimate actions that have gone beyond the control of government and enforcement agencies, including arson of the electricity pylon basement and other corporate property, and blocking of the river.\n\nThe decrease in KBK bauxite mining reflected a reduction in supply needed by the Nikolaev Alumina Refinery (which has switched to processing Dian-Dian bauxite). The Windalco mining decrease was a result of sufficient raw material stock at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe most substantial bauxite production volume growth occurred at the Friguia and Dian-Dian mines.\n\n## Bauxite production, (kt) 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nephelines\n\nRUSAL's nepheline syenite production was 4,599 kt in 2020, as compared to 4,244 kt in 2019.\n\nThe increase of the production volume of nepheline mainly reflected additional quantities required for alumina production.\n\nNepheline mines (Achinsk), (kt Wet)\n\n5,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Downstream projects Foil and packaging\n\nThe volume of foil produced by the Group's facilities in 2020 amounted to 103.44 kt, which was a 5.44 kt or 5.5% increase from 2019. The domestic supply of plain foil and tape from RUSAL Ural Foil and RUSAL Sayanal decreased by 3.87 kt in 2020 as Dozakl, a large buyer, left the market and purchased 5.6 kt less tape than it did in 2019. This loss was offset by additional sales to other domestic buyers.\n\nThe output of Ural Foil, Armenal and Sayana Foil grew 8%, 16% and 21%, respectively year-on-year as a result of equipment productivity.",

This in turn reduced the demand for aluminium from companies supplying finished products to these industries.\n\n## Secondary alloys\n\nThe amount of dross and aluminium-containing waste converted into secondary aluminium reduced in 2020 by 3.9 kt or 22% from the previous year due to a reduction in both internal and external dross and waste available for conversion.\n\n## Silicon production\n\nProduction volumes in 2020 decreased in comparison with 2019 due to falling market prices for silicon and, as a result, unprofitable production at LLC RUSAL Kremny Ural, the operation of which has been halted since 1 December 2019. The personnel has been reduced to necessary level to restart the facility when the situation in the silicon market improves.\n\nJSC Kremny continued operating four furnaces throughout 2020. In 2020, plant modernisation was completed, including the supply of a new type of hydraulic furnace mouth tending machines. A six-year development strategy for JSC Kremny was approved with planned restoration of idling capacities and improvement of environmental efficiency through the replacement of all 'wet'-type gas treatment plants with modern dry-type treatment plants with bag filters.\n\n## Other mining assets\n\nRUSAL owns and operates 15 mines and mine complexes, including bauxite mines (the resources of which are described above), two quartzite mines, one fluorite mine, two coal mines, one nepheline syenite mine and two limestone mines.\n\nThe long position in alumina capacity is supported by RUSAL's bauxite and nepheline syenite resource base.\n\nRUSAL jointly operates two coal mines with SamrukEnergo, the energy division of Samruk-Kazyna through a 50/50 joint venture, Bogatyr Coal LLP.\n\n## Bogatyr Coal LLP\n\nBogatyr Coal LLP, located in Kazakhstan, is a 50/50 joint venture between RUSAL and Samruk-Energo.\n\nBogatyr Coal LLP, which produced approximately 43.34 mt of coal in 2020, has approximately 1.66 billion tonnes of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and has Measured Mineral Resources and Indicated Mineral Resources totalling approximately 2.01 billion tonnes as at 31 December 2020 (reported on under JORC by SRK). Bogatyr Coal LLP generated sales of approximately USD 248 million in 2019 and USD 243 million in 2020. Russian and Kazakh customers contribute to approximately 30% and 70% of sales.",

        "page_content": "## Investment in Norilsk Nickel\n\nNorilsk Nickel is the world's largest palladium producer, the largest high-grade nickel producer, and one of the leading producers of platinum, copper, and cobalt. RUSAL held a 27.82% shareholding stake in Norilsk Nickel as at the latest practicable date.\n\nRUSAL's shareholding in Norilsk Nickel allows for significant diversification of earnings through Norilsk Nickel's exposure to PGMs 1 and non-ferrous metals (nickel, copper, cobalt), and broadens RUSAL's strategic opportunities. The Company's objective is to maximise the value of this investment for all shareholders.\n\n## Company profile and financial results 2\n\nAs of 31 December 2019, Norilsk Nickel's resource base on the Taimyr and Kola Peninsula consisted of 757 mt of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and 2,020 mt of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. Its key assets are located in the Norilsk Region, the Kola Peninsula, and the Trans-Baikal Territory in Russia, and in Finland.\n\nIn 2020, Norilsk Nickel produced 236 kt of nickel, 487 kt of copper, 2,826 koz of palladium and 695 koz of platinum. Compared to 2019, the following is to be noted:\n\n- -The growth in production of nickel (+3%) primarily reflected an increase in the production of nickel concentrate for sale at Kola MMC and higher processing volumes of the Company's Russian feed at Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta (production of nickel from own Russian feed also increased by 3%).\n- -The decline in production of copper (-2%) was attributed to changes in saleable product mix, reallocation of copper semi-products within the Company's divisions and lower processed volumes of concentrate, which was purchased from Rostec (production of copper from own Russian feed also decreased by 2%).\n- -The decline in PGM production (-3% palladium, -1% platinum) was attributed to the commissioning of the new precious metals concentrate production line at the metallurgical shop of Kola MMC, as well as a high base effect from 2019, when Krasnoyarsk Precious Metals Plant processed earlier accumulated work-in-progress inventory (production of PGM from own Russian feed decreased by 3%).\n\nNorilsk Nickel's metal sales are highly diversified by region: Europe, Asia, North and South America, Russia and the CIS; and by product: nickel, copper, palladium, platinum, semi-products and other metals.\n\nThe market value of RUSAL's investment in Norilsk Nickel amounted to USD 14,123 million as of 31 December 2020, an increase in comparison with the market value as of 31 December 2019 (USD 13,586 million). Market capitalisation of Norilsk Nickel was under effect from positive trends in end metal markets and Russian rouble depreciation, which was partly offset by negative external market factors (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and internal factors (the accident at Heat and Power Plant No 3 (HPP-3) in May 2020).\n\nIn 2020, Norilsk Nickel recognised an environmental provision of USD 2.2 billion following the diesel fuel leak at the HPP-3 industrial site and in anticipation of compensation payable in respect of the environmental damage caused (more details below in the section Accident at HPP-3) that led to EBITDA decreasing in 2020.\n\n## Accident at HPP-3\n\nOn 29 May 2020, the fuel storage facility at heat and power plant No. 3 (HPP-3) in the Kayerkan neighbourhood of Norilsk failed due to a sudden sinking of its support posts, resulting in fuel leakage. According to preliminary investigations, 21.2 kt of diesel fuel leaked beyond the bunding perimeter into a designated pit, into nearby soil and into the Bezymianny Stream, and the Daldykan and Ambarnaya Rivers. Special containment booms were installed and effectively prevented the contamination of the Pyasino Lake. No one was hurt and the city of Norilsk was not harmed in any way.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the spill was fully localised and the majority of the fuel and water mixture had been collected. Contaminated soil was placed into sealed off hangars to prevent further environmental risks. Waterfuel mixture collected from the Ambarnaya River and near the power plant was placed into temporary holding tanks.\n\n- 1 PGMs are platinum group metals.",

        "page_content": "## Metals segment review continued\n\nIn 2021, continued clean-up and rehabilitation works are planned. According to the Norilsk Nickel Group assessment, total expenditure for clean-up and rehabilitation is estimated at USD 144 million (RUB 10.6 billion at the RUB/USD exchange rate as at 31 December 2020), from which clean-up expenses incurred in 2020 were USD 48 million. On 5 February 2021 the Arbitrazh court of the Krasnoyarsk region ordered Norilsk Nickel to pay environmental damages of RUB 146.177 billion (USD 1,979 million at the RUB/ USD exchange rate as at 31 December 2020). On 19 February 2021, Norilsk Nickel announced that it had decided to comply with this judgement.\n\nAs one of the main shareholders of Norilsk Nickel, RUSAL was very concerned about the incident at HPP-3. RUSAL supported the stringent investigation of the circumstances on site that caused the accident and proposed measures to the Norilsk Nickel Board of Directors to help prevent such accidents in the future. Norilsk Nickel's Board of Directors supported some of RUSAL's proposals to strengthen the management team, including the introduction of a Deputy President for Environment, appointed in June 2020.\n\n## Projects BEMO project\n\nThe Boguchany (BEMO) project involves the construction of the 3,000 MW Boguchany HPP (average annual electricity output: 17.6 billion kWh) and Boguchany Aluminium Smelter capable of producing 600,000 tonnes of metal per annum in the Krasnoyarsk Territory in Siberia.\n\nThe construction of the Boguchany Aluminium Smelter is divided into two stages (each stage with capacity for 298 kt of aluminium per annum). The first part of the first stage (149 kt of aluminium per annum, 168 pots) was launched in 2015, and the second part of the first stage was launched in March 2019. In May 2019, the first stage of the smelter reached its design capacity. In 2020, 290,046 tonnes of aluminium and alloys was produced, which is 32,333 tonnes more than in 2019. A total of 1,017,140 tonnes of aluminium and alloys has been produced since the start of the commissioning.\n\nThe second stage of the Boguchany Aluminium Smelter is to be considered with a strategic partner, RusHydro, subject to the state of the market and the availability of project financing.\n\nBoguchany HPP is the fourth step in the Angara Hydroelectric Power Chain, the largest hydro project ever completed in Russia. Construction of the power plant was suspended in Soviet times due to the lack of financing, but was resumed in May 2006 by RUSAL and RusHydro, after they jointly agreed to complete it.\n\nThe project's 79-metre-high and 2,587-metre-long composite gravity, rock-fill dam was completed at the end of 2011, and nine 333 MW hydropower units of Boguchany HPP commenced operation between 2012 and 2014. The total installed capacity of all nine hydro units in operation amounts to 2,997 MW.\n\nThe hydropower plant started the commercial supply of electricity to the wholesale electricity and capacity market on 1 December 2012. Since its launch, Boguchany HPP has generated 101.364 TWh of electricity. In 2020, the hydropower plant produced and delivered 17.549 TWh to the wholesale electricity and capacity market for the first time in the entire period of operation, which exceeds the 2019 electricity output by 9.6%, or 1.535 TWh.\n\n## Taishet\n\nConstruction of the Taishet aluminium smelter was started in 2006. Due to unfavourable market conditions, RUSAL decided to suspend the project in 2009. After the economic recovery and improvement in market conditions in 2016, the Board of Directors of RUSAL decided to resume the construction of LC-1 (first series) of the Taishet smelter and approved the start of preliminary work. Actual construction of the Taishet Aluminium Smelter resumed in 2017.\n\nThe project includes construction of an aluminium smelter in Taishet in the Irkutsk Region (Eastern Siberia), with a design production capacity of the LC-1 (first series) of 352 pots, or 428.5 ktpa. The total electricity consumption by the LC-1 (first series) is estimated at 6,370 million kWh. We anticipate the first metal to be produced in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of COVID-19\n\nIn 2020, En+ Group, just like the entire world, faced the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the Company faced the following main challenges:\n\n- -protecting employees while being unable to suspend operations\n- -working in highly volatile macroeconomic environment\n- -supplying our customers with critical heat and electricity, as well as responding to our metals segment customers' needs, including re-directing of product flows as required.\n\n## Protecting employees preserving uninterrupted operations\n\nThe Group launched a programme at the end of February 2020 to protect its employees against COVID-19, drawing on the expertise gained by RUSAL amidst the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014-15. The measures included buying personal protective gear; enhancing activities of medical units and paramedics; disinfection and cleaning of premises; and buying air purifying systems. Sickbays were arranged at the premises of operating companies for employees who might show symptoms of the disease, where they were able to wait for an ambulance. A zonal approach was applied at the sites to isolate the operating/auxiliary crews from the engineering/administrative staff. HR departments monitored potential COVID-19 cases and assisted in arranging testing campaigns. Relevant medicines were purchased to be distributed to employees, if and when needed. A hotline was established to advise employees on measures to combat the coronavirus. A broad intra-corporate information campaign was launched in the early days of the pandemic to raise employee awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures and to inform them about what to do if they showed symptoms of the disease. Routine testing was used to identify asymptomatic cases.\n\n## Decline in global aluminum demand\n\nFor the full year 2020, global aluminum demand was down by 1.7% y-o-y to 63.9 million tonnes. Rest of the world ex-China (RoW) demand contracted by 8.9% to 26.0 million tonnes. However, China offset this with its robust demand recovery, demonstrating a strong growth of 3.9% to 37.9 million tonnes.\n\nAt the same time, global aluminium production in 2020 grew by 2.3% to 65.3 million tonnes, taking into account (i) small RoW growth of 0.2% y-o-y to 28.0 million tonnes and (ii) 3.9% growth y-o-y in China to 37.2 million tonnes.\n\nAs a results global market was in surplus by 1.4 million tonnes during 2020. And this led to drop in aluminium prices, down to 1,460 dollars per tonne in April/May. Average 2020 aluminium price amounted to 1,702 dollars per tonne (down 5% y-o-y).\n\nIn response to the challenging market environment caused by COVID-19, the Metals segment successfully\n\nadjusted its sales, with a material increase in sales to geographies where demand was stronger. On the backdrop of falling global demand for aluminium Metals segment was the only key producer who increased VAP sales to 44% of total sales in 2020 and gained VAP share in sales portfolio.\n\n## Lower demand for electricity amidst restrictions\n\nThe restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major decline in power consumption from the Russian market.\n\nAccording to OJSC System Operator of the Unified Energy System, the power consumption from Russia's Unified Energy System was 2.4% lower in 2020 compared to 2019. The lowest figures were shown in May (down 5.5%) and June (down 6.0%); the remaining months, on average, registered 1.9% decrease vs. 2019. The most dramatic decline in the European part of Russia was seen in the Urals Unified Energy System (down 5.4%) and the Middle Volga Unified Energy System (down 4.2%). The North-Western Unified Energy System showed a smaller decline of 2.9%. The smallest decline in figures was seen in the Central Unified Energy System (down 0.8%) and the Southern Unified Energy System (down 0.6%). The Siberia Unified Energy System registered a 1.0% decline vs. 2019. The situation in Siberia differed from the other regions as its power-intensive operations were not suspended, preserving their normal power consumption.\n\nPower consumption in the key regions where the Group has operations, i.e. the Irkutsk Region and the Krasnoyarsk Territory, was higher when compared to the rest of the regions connected to the Siberia UES in 2020. The Irkutsk Region registered a 0.9% increase in consumption despite the pandemic, which is the highest result among the Siberian regions connected to the Unified Energy System. The energy system of the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Republic of Tyva showed a decrease of 0.7%. This better performance is attributable to the large consumers based in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Irkutsk Region, where the En+ Group's key energy assets are located, as they maintained power consumption and did not interrupt their operations. The western part of Siberia, i.e. the Tomsk and the Omsk regions, demonstrated the sharpest decline in consumption, respectively down 8.5% and 3.1% year-on-year.\n\n## Electricity sales in the retail market\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused an increase in nonpayments for electricity in the retail market, which peaked in April 2020. Some employees shifted to working from home, while sales companies closed their front offices in the Irkutsk and Nizhny Novgorod Regions.\n\nFor many years, the Group has developed remote and online payment services and applications, which helped to reduce the level of payment failures and helped avoid a greater increase in non-payments.",

        "page_content": "## Power segment review\n\n## Market overview 1\n\n## Overview of the Russian power sector\n\nThe Russian Federation's power sector is among the largest in the world, with installed electricity capacity of 245.3 GW and electricity output of 1,047.0 TWh as of 2020. The majority of Russia's electricity demand is met by thermal power plants that use natural gas and thermal coal as their primary fuel. In Siberia, thermal power plants make up 50.9% of installed capacity with hydropower generation making up 48.53%, remaining 0.57% are solar power plants.\n\nThe Unified Energy System (UES) of Russia covers most of the Russian territory. Grid interconnections between different energy systems are limited, with the Russian wholesale power and capacity market split into two pricing zones. The first pricing zone, the European-Ural price zone 2 , includes the territory of the European part of Russia (including the Urals), while the second pricing zone, the Siberian Integrated Energy System (IES), encompasses Siberia. The electricity prices of the two price zones are driven by the differences in capacity and fuel mix in the respective price zones.\n\nThe Siberian IES has an operational area of 4,944,300 sq km, with a population of approximately 19 million people. The Siberian IES comprises 115 power plants with a total installed capacity of 52.1 GW, including 25.3 GW of HPPs (48.5%), 26.5 GW of thermal power plants (TPP) (50.9%) and 300.2 MW of solar plants (0.57%). The grid of the Siberian IES consists of 110, 220, 500 and 1,150 kV lines. The total length of power lines is 102,614 km 3 .\n\nA unique feature of the Siberian IPS is the significant role of HPPs in both the installed electricity capacity mix and electricity output. Thermal power in the Siberian IES is generated mostly through coal-fired power plants, which are primarily located near regions where the coal is mined.\n\n## Electricity demand\n\nElectricity consumption in the UES of Russia in 2020 decreased by 2.4% year-on-year to 1,033.7 TWh (down 2.7% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020). Electricity consumption in the European-Ural price zone 4 decreased by 3.0% to 783.7 TWh (down 3.2% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020). Electricity consumption in the Siberian IES decreased by 1.0% to 209.4 TWh (down 1.3% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020).\n\n## Electricity supply\n\nThe total installed electricity capacity of the UES of Russia as of 1 January 2021 amounted to 245.3 GW and decreased by 1.0 GW in 2020. The decrease can be explained by a 1.86 GW commissioning of new capacity, a 3.25 GW decommissioning of old capacity and a 0.36 GW capacity increase linked to remarking, corrections, etc. In the second price zone, 81 MW was commissioned, 101 MW was decommissioned and there was an increase in capacity as a result of 54 MW being remarked.\n\nIn 2020, electricity output in the UES of Russia decreased by 3.1% year-on-year to 1,047.0 TWh (down 3.4% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020). Electricity output in the European-Ural price zone decreased by 3.8% to 796.2 TWh (down 4.1% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020).\n\nElectricity output within the Siberian IES in 2020 was 207.0 TWh, down 0.8% year-on-year (down 1.1% excluding the impact of 29 February 2020). Output from HPPs in Siberia increased by 9.2% year-on-year to 117.7 TWh. In 2020 the Group's HPPs generated approximately 58.9% of the total electricity produced by hydropower stations in the Siberian IES. At the same time, thermal power plants decreased their electricity production by 11.7% year-on-year to 89.0 TWh. In 2020, combined heat and power (CHP) plants accounted for 43.0% of full-year electricity output within the Siberian IES, while HPPs accounted for 56.9%.\n\n- 1 Unless otherwise stated, data for the Power segment's 'Market overview' section is sourced from ATS, Association 'NP Market Council', System Operator of the Unified Energy System of the Russian Federation.\n- 2  Comprises the Central, Central Volga, Urals, North-West and South Energy systems.\n- 3  According to the System Operator of the Unified Power System of the Russian Federation (www.so-ups.ru/).\n- 4  Comprises the Central, Central Volga, Urals, North-West and South Energy systems.",

        "page_content": "## Power segment review continued\n\n## Electricity and capacity prices\n\nIn the Siberian IES, electricity spot prices are effectively determined by the production costs of the least efficient coal-fired generation plants (mostly CHPs and condensing power plants), with HPPs (and some CHPs operating in must-run mode) acting as price takers. Over the long term, electricity prices tend to move with prices of thermal coal. A significant proportion of the power generated by Siberian CHPs is produced using locally sourced brown coal.\n\nDue to seasonality in demand and the intermittency of hydropower, the price of electricity can exhibit significant fluctuations throughout the course of the year.\n\nOne of the major factors exerting significant influence in the medium term is the water inflow to Siberian HPPs, which determines the availability of low-cost hydropower for the wholesale market.\n\nIn 2020, spot prices for the European-Ural price zone decreased by 6.0% year-on-year and averaged 1,211 RUB/MWh, while spot prices for the Siberian IES decreased 2.0% year-on-year, averaging 872 RUB/MWh.\n\n## Low-carbon cryptocurrency mining: Bit+\n\nBit+ is a joint venture of En+ Group and BitRiver, operator of the largest data centre offering colocation services for bitcoin mining in Russia, for mining cryptocurrencies at low cost with a low-carbon footprint.\n\nUnder the partnership, En+ Group provides low-cost electricity from renewable energy sources to Bit+'s new mining operations while BitRiver runs and manages the operations. The first phase of Bit+'s new facility, with 10 MW of electricity committed by En+, is currently operational, with plans to scale the facility to approximately 40 MW.\n\nThe facility is located near BitRiver's current data centre in Bratsk, in the Irkutsk Region of Russia, and is composed of modular cryptocurrency mining units. Every modular unit is a specially converted shipping container and is equivalent to a full-size cryptocurrency mining data centre. Fourteen of these modules will be operational in the facility's first phase. Each module can accommodate up to 400 units of Bitmain's latest generation S19 Pro (110 Th) miners.\n\nWhile electricity prices generally reflect short-term variations in the supply-demand balance and cover generators' variable costs, capacity prices cover fixed costs and sustaining CAPEX requirements.\n\nReflecting the long-term nature of these decisions, the capacity market functions rather differently to the electricity market, with annual auctions carried out to determine the price and availability of capacity in four years' time. Capacity prices are thus currently determined through to 2026. Starting from 2018, prices are indexed annually at the previous year's Consumer Price Index (CPI) minus 0.1% - the indexation is applied starting from 1 January of the year when the auction was conducted, until 1 January of the year when the capacity is supplied (prices were previously indexed at CPI minus 1%).\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation defined rules for the indexation of price parameters at competitive capacity outtake (CCO), which provide for a 20% growth in price parameters until 2024 and growth with inflation afterwards. Furthermore, the offtake period was increased to six years instead of four and further CCOs are conducted every year with the period of delivery in six years: in 2021 the COO has been conducted for 2026.\n\nThe Group actively supports the development of datacentres in the Irkutsk Region. The Company's energy assets in the region produce low-carbon, inexpensive electricity from renewable sources, and En+ is able to offer surplus power to Bit+. Moreover, the low average annual temperature reduces the energy required by the datacentres, making them more efficient and further minimising their carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As at 31 December 2020, 77.5% of the installed electricity capacity was represented by HPPs, with the remaining 22.5% accounted for by CHPs (which are predominantly coal-fired) and one solar plant.\n\nThe Company produced 82.2 TWh 2 of electricity in 2020, which represented 7.7% of Russia's total electricity generation and 39.7% of the Siberian IES's total electricity generation for the period.\n\n## Hydropower generation\n\nHydropower generation is the main focus of the Group's Power segment. The Group operates five HPPs 3 , including three of the five largest HPPs in Russia and of the twenty largest HPPs globally, in each case in terms of installed electricity capacity. In 2020, the Power segment's HPPs produced 69.3 TWh of electricity, which accounted for 84.3% of the total electricity generated by the Group.\n\n4\n\nTotal electricity production\n\n,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Heat generation, (mn Gcal)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal electricity output by the Angara cascade HPPs (Irkutsk, Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk HPPs) increased by 6.3% year-on-year to 47.3 TWh in 2020, due to increased water reserves in the reservoirs of the HPPs on the Angara cascade.\n\nIn 2020, Krasnoyarsk HPP's total power generation increased by 11.7%, from 19.7 TWh in 2019 to 22.0 TWh, mainly due to higher water levels in the Krasnoyarsk reservoir, in turn caused by high inflow in 2020 compared to the previous year. At the end of 2020, the level of the Krasnoyarsk reservoir was 236.22 m, compared to 236.03 m at the end of 2019.\n\n## Combined heat and power plants\n\nThe Group's \u0421HPs decreased electricity output in 2020 by 5.1% year-on-year to 12.9 TWh, primarily as a result of higher HPP production on the back of more favourable hydrological conditions. Heat generation amounted to 26.9 million Gcal (down 1.5% year-on-year).\n\nAbakan Solar Power Plant (SPP) generated 5.5 GWh in 2020 (down 11.3% year-on-year).\n\n- 1 Including Onda HPP with installed power capacity of 0.08 GW (located in the European part of Russia, leased to UC RUSAL); excluding Boguchany HPP with installed power capacity of 3,000 MW (50/50 JV between UC RUSAL and RusHydro).\n- 2  Excluding Onda HPP with installed power capacity of 0.08 GW (located in the European part of Russia, leased to UC RUSAL); excluding Boguchany HPP (50/50 JV between UC RUSAL and RusHydro).\n- 3  Including Onda HPP.\n- 4  Excluding Onda HPP with installed power capacity of 0.08 GW (located in European part of Russia, leased to UC RUSAL); excluding Boguchany HPP with installed power capacity of 3,000 MW (50/50 JV of UC RUSAL and RusHydro).\n- 5  Includes Irkutsk, Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk HPPs.\n- 6  Krasnoyarskaya HPP.",

        "page_content": "## Retail\n\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries LLC Irkutskenergosbyt, JSC Volgaenergosbyt and LLC MAREM+, purchases electricity on the wholesale market (from both the generating facilities of the Group and third parties) and then resells it on the retail market to both industrial consumers that do not have access to the wholesale market and residential consumers. The Group is involved in heat and electricity sales directly to end-users.\n\nIn 2007, the Group's subsidiaries in the Irkutsk and Nizhny Novgorod Regions were granted the status of guaranteeing suppliers within these regions. In accordance with this status, the Group is under an obligation to conclude an electricity supply contract with any consumer located within the boundaries of these operational areas that applies for such a contract.\n\n## Electricity transmission and distribution\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group operated a transmission and distribution system of approximately 41,000 km of high and low voltage lines with an annual output of approximately 48 TWh. Through this system the Group transmits electricity generated at the Angara cascade HPPs to wholesale and retail consumers, including RUSAL's aluminium smelters. Other generation facilities of the Group, such as Krasnoyarsk HPP and Avtozavodskaya CHP, do not use this transmission network, as they are not located within close geographical proximity to the network.\n\n## Coal production\n\nThe Coal segment provides the Group's CHPs with a self-sufficient coal resource base and covers the En+ Group's internal coal demand. A portion of the coal production is sold to third parties both in Russia and abroad.\n\nCoal prices in the domestic market are determined based on the level of competition and demand from various categories of consumers in the region (energy, utilities, other industrial enterprises, general population).\n\n## Projects\n\n## The New Energy modernisation programme\n\nNew Energy is a programme aimed at modernising the power plants of the Angara and Yenisei HPP cascade with a view to ramping up the energy output from the same volume of water passing through the hydropower turbines. Another objective is to reduce the Company's environmental footprint by curbing the greenhouse gas emissions of the Company's coal-fired power plants. In 2020, the programme has enabled En+ Group to increase its power output by 1.71 TWh.\n\nThe programme assumes a large-scale overhaul and replacement of the core equipment of the Company's largest Siberian HPPs, i.e. Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk, Irkutsk and Ust-Ilimsk HPPs. The programme envisages modernisation of hydroelectric generation units; replacement of runners. Increased efficiency will be provided by the new runners' improved blades and by utilising new materials, with an efficiency rate increase zof up to 8% depending on the runner. Higher safety and better reliability of the HPPs is another priority of the modernisation programme, which will mitigate the risks associated with cavitation and address the HPP generator wear problem.\n\nThe modernisation programme investment is expected to total RUB 21 billion in the period to 2026 (around USD 284.3 million as of 31 December 2020 1 ), including funds already invested in the project (RUB 10 billion as at 31 December 2020 for the above projects).\n\nThe HPP efficiency will match that of the world's best performers after the New Energy programme is completed, providing for better reliability and a higher quality power supply to our Siberian consumers. On top of the expected economic improvement, the New Energy programme will positively impact the environment of the Siberian regions in which we operate. Hydroelectric energy is used to partially replace the energy generated by coal-fired power plants and thus prevent GHG emissions of 1.98 mt of \u0421\u041e 2 e in 2020. The modernised turbines also incorporate an up-to-date runner design that prevents turbine oil leakage into water.\n\n| Bratsk HPP  (18 generation units)            | Ust-Ilimsk HPP  (16 generation units)   | Krasnoyarsk HPP  (12 generation units)   | Irkutsk HPP  (8 generation units)                |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Projects completed and underway              | Projects completed and underway         | Projects completed and underway          | Projects completed and underway                  |\n| 12 of 18 runners replaced  (2007-2017)       | 4 of 16 runners replaced  (2014-2018)   | 2 of 12 runners replaced  (2016-2019)    | 1 generation unit replaced   in 2020             |\n| 6 remaining runners to   be replaced by 2026 |                                         | 6 of 12 runners to be replaced  by 2025  | 3 of 8 generation units to   be replaced by 2023 |",

        "page_content": "## Power segment review continued\n\nIn 2020, the Company launched a new hydroelectric unit at the Irkutsk HPP and began works on the next hydroelectric unit replacement. Major works began at the Krasnoyarsk HPP as well as a project to replace seven of the plant's power transformers. The Company completed a review of all equipment at the Bratsk HPP and hydraulic power unit wheels were subsequently ordered.\n\n## CHP modernisation programme\n\nThe Group participated in the state programmes for CHP modernisation providing us with a guaranteed return on investment. The Capacity Allocation Contracts (CAC) will be signed between buyers, market regulator (ATS) and generating companies of the wholesale market, providing the key criteria for modernisation, parameters of capacity supply after the modernisation and return on investment.\n\nThrough this programme the Group will improve the reliability and safety of 1,445 MW of its CHP capacity (32.9% of total CHP capacity). Total expected CAPEX for CHPs is USD 225 million 1 (RUB 16.6 billion) in 2020-2026. The current approved generating facilities should be completed and launched by 2026, with the project's internal rate of return at around 14%.\n\nIn 2020, the Company signed a contract for the supply of three new-generation turbo generators with a total capacity of 450 MW to Irkutsk CHP-10 in Irkutsk. At the CHP-6 in Bratsk, the main equipment will be replaced by 2022, which will increase the plant's capacity by 5 MW.\n\n## Small HPP project\n\nAs part of the state programme backed by the CAC mechanism for renewable projects, En+ Group is implementing the small-scale Segozerskaya HPP (8.1 MW) in Karelia (Russia). Total expected CAPEX for small HPP construction is approximately USD 19 million 1 (RUB 1.4 billion).\n\nIn 2020, En+ Group completed design engineering works for the small-scale Segozerskaya HPP. In 2021 En+ Group plans to launch construction works on the project site.\n\nEn+ Group has formed a portfolio of projects with a total installed capacity of about 200 MW. Depending on the results of the project feasibility studies, a decision will be made on when these projects will be implemented.\n\n## Electric vehicle charging stations in Irkutsk\n\nEn+ Group installed three pilot charging stations for electric vehicles in the Irkutsk Region. This initiative to support the growth of clean energy vehicle use is fully aligned with the Group's strategic focus on climate action.\n\nStations were launched in December 2020 in Irkutsk and in the village of Listvyanka on the shore of Lake Baikal. In the initial stage, En+ installed electric filling stations for 'fast' charging of electric vehicles using CHAdeMO and CCS Combo (Type 2) connectors at DC with power of 50 kW. Fast charging makes it possible reach 80% battery capacity within 20 minutes.\n\nFurther development of the network of 'fast' chargers in Irkutsk and the Irkutsk Region will be subject to the continued growth of the local EV market. The region has seen a significant increase in EV use over the past 3 years. According to Autostat 1 number of EVs in Russia increased by 71% in 2020 compared to 2019 with more than 60% of EV owners located in Siberia and Far East of Russia.\n\nIn the medium term, En+ plans to install 'fast' chargers along motorways heading to Baikalsk, Khuzhir and the Olkhonsky district. In 2021, the Group plans to launch five new stations.\n\n- '  As a responsible corporate citizen, En+'s primary aim for this project is to help improve air quality in our local communities. Our hope is that with the launch of these charging complexes, the number of electric vehicles used in the Irkutsk Region will continue to grow, helping to reduce local pollution and the region's overall contribution to climate change. En+ is ready to expand the network of stations in response to demand.'\n\nMikhail  Khardikov\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's EBITDA margin remained strong at 18.0%, reflecting effective cost management, supported by the positive impact of rouble depreciation on production costs.\n\nLower sales volumes of primary aluminium and alloys y-o-y reflected that in 2019 we disposed of inventory accumulated during 2018 due to OFAC sanctions. Sales of VAPs increased 11.3% y-o-y and reached 44% of total aluminium and alloys sales. The Power segment was primarily affected by rouble depreciation.\n\nWe ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet. Our net debt at 31 December 2020 decreased by 3.7% y-o-y to USD 9,826 million. Net debt attributable to the Metals segment decreased by 14.0% y-o-y due to continued cost and structure optimisation of the debt portfolio. Net debt attributable to the Power segment increased by 14.0% y-o-y reflecting new loan agreements with Sberbank. In 2020, interest rates declined globally and there was a fall in the Central Bank of Russia's key rate. This translated into lower interest rates applied to our credit portfolio, especially in the Power segment where all debt is rouble denominated and the majority is on a floating base.",

        "page_content": "We generated USD 968 million of free cash flow, which included dividends received from Norilsk Nickel, following lower cash flow from operating activities and higher capital expenditure for En+.\n\nThe Group's capital expenditure increased 6.3% y-o-y and amounted to USD 1,128 million, as we continued to invest in enhancing operational efficiency as set out below.\n\nAs a part of our 'New Energy' programme, we launched a new hydroelectric unit at the Irkutsk HPP and works on the next hydroelectric unit replacement and we continued works at the Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk\n\nHPPs. We also launched a range of modernisation projects at our CHPs aimed at improving reliability, productivity and safety of our assets as well as our environmental footprint.\n\nThe Metals segment continued its investment in key development projects. Core projects include the Taishet aluminium smelter and the Taishet anode plant. The Taishet aluminium smelter is expected to produce its first metal in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, at the beginning of 2021 we launched the Ozernaya substation, which will provide the Taishet aluminium smelter with clean hydropower.\n\n## Key highlights\n\nThe following table provides selected data from the Group's key financial information:\n\n|                                                    | As at or year ended   31 December   | As at or year ended   31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                    | 2020                                | 2019                                |\n|                                                    | (USD mn)                            | (USD mn)                            |\n| Revenues                                           | 10,356                              | 11,752                              |\n| Gross profit                                       | 2,548                               | 2,879                               |\n| Gross profit margin                                | 24.6%                               | 24.5%                               |\n| Results from operating activities (EBIT)           | 1,010                               | 976                                 |\n| Operating profit margin                            | 9.8%                                | 8.3%                                |\n| Pre-tax profit                                     | 1,125                               | 1,580                               |\n| Profit for the year                                | 1,016                               | 1,304                               |\n| Net profit margin 1                                | 9.8%                                | 11.1%                               |\n| Adjusted EBITDA 2                                  | 1,861                               | 2,127                               |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin 3                           | 18.0%                               | 18.1%                               |\n| Net debt 4                                         | 9,826                               | 10,204                              |\n| Net working capital 5                              | 1,614                               | 2,042                               |\n| Free cash flow 6                                   | 968                                 | 1,614                               |\n| Basic earnings per share 7                         | 1.320                               | 1.356                               |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the Company | 3,156                               | 4,330                               |\n\n## Notes:\n\nIn 2020, our vertically integrated business model allowed us to deliver a healthy financial and operational performance.

        "page_content": "## Financial overview\n\nThe results of the Group's operations are divided into the Power and Metals segments. The Power segment comprises the power industry, including power generation, power trading and supply. It also includes supporting operations engaged in the supply of coal resources to the Group. The Metals segment consists of RUSAL, which includes RUSAL's equity investment in Norilsk Nickel.\n\nRUSAL is one of the leaders of the global aluminium industry. In 2020, the Company accounted for around 5.8% of global production of aluminium and 6.5% of alumina production.\n\nThe Company's management believes that the division of the results of the Group's operations into the Power and Metals segments enables investors and analysts to best assess the parts of the Group's business.\n\nIn its comparison of period to period results of operations, the Group presents its results of operations on a consolidated basis after intersegmental eliminations, in order to analyse changes, developments and trends by reference to the individual segment's results of operations (Power and Metals segments). Amounts attributable to the segments are presented prior to intersegmental eliminations between them.\n\n## Revenues\n\nThe following table provides the Group's revenue from sales, analysed by each product sold by the Group, for the years indicated:\n\n|                                           | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                  | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Sales of primary aluminium   and alloys   | 6,969                    | 7,906                    |\n| Sales of electricity                      | 1,169                    | 1,300                    |\n| Sales of alumina and bauxite              | 534                      | 668                      |\n| Sales of semi finished products  and foil | 547                      | 563                      |\n| Sales of heat                             | 426                      | 462                      |\n| Other revenues                            | 711                      | 853                      |\n| Total revenues                            | 10,356                   | 11,752                   |\n\nThe following table provides the Group's revenue by business segment for the years indicated:\n\n|                                         | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Metals segment                          | 8,566                    | 9,711                    |\n| Power segment                           | 2,697                    | 2,989                    |\n| Business segment revenues               | 11,263                   | 12,700                   |\n| Elimination of intersegmental  revenues | (907)                    | (948)                    |\n| Total revenues                          | 10,356                   | 11,752                   |\n\nThe Group's revenue is mainly attributable to the Metals segment's operations. In 2020 and 2019, its revenue (before intersegmental elimination) accounted for 76.1% and 76.5% of the Group's revenue, respectively. In 2020 and 2019, the Power segment's revenue (before intersegmental elimination) accounted for 23.9% and 23.5% of the Group's revenue, respectively.\n\nThe Group's revenue decreased by USD 1,396 million, or 11.9%, from USD 11,752 million in 2019 to USD 10,356 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a fall in the Metals segment's revenue, following a 5.0% decrease in the LME aluminium price to an average of USD 1,702 per tonne in 2020, from USD 1,792 per tonne in 2019 and a 6.0% decline in the sales volumes of primary aluminium and alloys given normalised levels of inventories of primary aluminium in 2020. The Group's revenue was also affected by a decrease in the Power segment's revenue, mainly following the depreciation of the rouble.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe following table provides the Group's cost of sales by business segment for the years indicated:\n\n|                                              | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                     | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Metals segment                               | 7,112                    | 8,113                    |\n| Power segment                                | 1,582                    | 1,736                    |\n| Business segment cost of sales               | 8,694                    | 9,849                    |\n| Elimination of intersegmental  cost of sales | (886)                    | (976)                    |\n| Total cost of sales                          | 7,808                    | 8,873                    |\n\nThe cost of sales in the Power and Metals segments reflects costs incurred directly by the sale and production of the principal products and services of each of those business segments. For the Power segment, the cost of sales primarily includes costs for electricity and capacity purchased for resale, the cost of raw materials, fuel, personnel expenses, depreciation and amortisation. For the Metals segment, the cost of sales mainly consists of the cost of energy, alumina, bauxite, other raw materials, personnel expenses, depreciation and amortisation.",

        "page_content": "## Financial overview continued\n\nThe Group's share of the profits of its associates and joint ventures decreased by USD 698 million, or 41.8%, to USD 971 million in 2020 from USD 1,669 million in 2019. The change in the share of the profits of the associates and joint ventures in 2020 as compared to 2019 can primarily be attributed to the decrease in profit from the Group's investment in Norilsk Nickel. In 2020, Norilsk Nickel recognised an environmental provision in the amount of USD 2.2 billion due to liquidation of diesel fuel leak at the industrial site of HPP-3 in Norilsk and compensation of environmental damages that resulted in a decrease in its EBITDA in 2020.\n\nThe market value of the investment amounted to USD 14,123 million and USD 13,586 million as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively, and is determined by multiplying the quoted bid price per share on the Moscow Exchange on the year-end date by the number of shares held by the Group.\n\n## Finance income and costs\n\nThe Group's finance income primarily consists of interest income and net foreign exchange gain. The Group's finance costs primarily consist of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and net foreign exchange loss.\n\n|                                                           | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                                  | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Finance income                                            |                          |                          |\n| Net foreign exchange gain                                 | 98                       | -                        |\n| Interest income                                           | 61                       | 82                       |\n| Dividend income                                           | 1                        | 1                        |\n| Total finance income                                      | 160                      | 83                       |\n| Finance costs                                             |                          |                          |\n| Interest expense                                          | (788)                    | (987)                    |\n| Net foreign exchange loss                                 | -                        | (114)                    |\n| Change in fair value of derivative  financial instruments | (226)                    | (21)                     |\n| Other finance costs                                       | (2)                      | (26)                     |\n| Total finance costs                                       | (1,016)                  | (1,148)                  |\n\nThe Group's finance income for 2020 increased by USD 77 million, or 92.8%, to USD 160 million from USD 83 million in 2019, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains.\n\nThe Group's finance costs for 2020 decreased by USD 132 million, or 11.5%, from USD 1,148 million in 2019 to USD 1,016 million in 2020 as a result of a decrease in interest expense (USD 788 million in 2020 compared to USD 987 million in 2019) and result of foreign exchange losses.\n\n## Profit before taxation\n\nFor the reasons described above, the Group recorded a profit before taxation of USD 1,125 million in 2020 as compared to USD 1,580 million in 2019. In 2020, the Power segment generated a profit before taxation of USD 409 million compared to USD 492 million in 2019. In 2020, the Metals segment generated a profit before taxation of USD 716 million as compared to USD 1,054 million in 2019.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nThe Group's income tax expense for 2020 decreased by USD 167 million, or 60.5%, to USD 109 million from USD 276 million in 2019, as a result of the lower profit before taxation in 2020 as compared to 2019. The current tax expense decreased by USD 146 million, or 39.6%, during this period, primarily due to a decrease in taxable profit. Deferred tax increased by USD 21 million from USD 93 million in 2019, to a tax benefit of USD 114 million in 2020, primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to tax losses incurred by various Group companies.\n\n## Profit for the year\n\nFor the reasons described above, the Group's profit for the year ended 31 December 2020 was USD 1,016 million, as compared to profit for the year ended 31 December 2019 of USD 1,304 million.",

The decrease was primarily driven by a 6.0% fall in the volume of primarily aluminium sales and the depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar between the comparable periods.\n\nThe cost of alumina decreased by USD 156 million, or by 20.4%, to USD 608 million in 2020 as compared to USD 764 million in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the alumina purchase price of 12.1% between the periods.\n\nThe cost of bauxite decreased by USD 36 million, or by 7.5%, to USD 447 million in 2020 as compared to USD 483 million in 2019.\n\nThe cost of raw materials (other than alumina and bauxite) and other costs decreased by 8.6% for the year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, due to a decrease in the raw materials purchase price (prices for the raw petroleum coke decreased by 25.9%, calcined petroleum coke by 18.4%, pitch by 26.4%, and caustic soda by 17.6%).\n\nEnergy costs decreased by USD 186 million, or by 9.1%, to USD 1,868 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to USD 2,054 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, due to depreciation of the Russian rouble against the US dollar and a decrease in the average electricity prices between the same periods.\n\nFinished goods consist mainly of primary aluminium and alloys (approx. 94%). The dynamic of change between the reporting periods was driven by fluctuations in the physical inventory of primary aluminium and alloys between the reporting dates: a 2.6% increase in 2020 and a 38.0% decrease in 2019.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin\n\nIn 2020, the Metals segment's adjusted EBITDA (before intersegmental elimination) decreased by USD 95 million, or 9.8%, to USD 871 million from USD 966 million in 2019. The factors that contributed to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin were the same ones that influenced the operating results.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Metals segment's adjusted EBITDA to its results from operating activities for the periods indicated:\n\n|                                                    | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                           | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Reconciliation of adjusted  EBITDA                 |                          |                          |\n| Results from operating activities                  | 279                      | 87                       |\n| Add:                                               |                          |                          |\n| Amortisation and depreciation                      | 570                      | 566                      |\n| Loss on disposal of property,  plant and equipment | 13                       | 22                       |\n| Impairment of non current assets                   | 9                        | 291                      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                    | 871                      | 966                      |\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Metals segment's adjusted net profit and recurring net profit to its net profit for the periods indicated:\n\n|                                                                                           | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                                                                  | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Reconciliation of adjusted net                                                            |                          |                          |\n| (loss)/profit                                                                             |                          |                          |\n| Net profit for the period                                                                 | 759                      | 960                      |\n| Adjusted for: Share of profits and other gains                                            | (930)                    | (1,543)                  |\n| and losses attributable to Norilsk  Nickel, net of tax effect Change in the fair value of | 222                      | 22                       |\n| Impairment of non current assets,  net of tax                                             | 9                        | 291                      |\n| Adjusted net (loss)/profit                                                                | 60                       | (270)                    |\n| Add back: Share of profits of Norilsk Nickel,  net of tax                                 | 930                      | 1,543                    |\n| Recurring net profit                                                                      | 990                      | 1,273                    |\n\nAdjusted net (loss)/profit for any period is defined as the net (loss)/profit adjusted for the net effect of the Metals segment's investment in Norilsk Nickel, the net effect of derivative financial instruments and the net effect of non-current assets impairment.

The increase in HPP generation can be primarily explained by increased water reserves.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe following table provides components of the Power segment's cost of sales (before intersegmental elimination) for the years indicated:\n\n|                                            | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                   | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Electricity and capacity                   | 361                      | 399                      |\n| Personnel expenses                         | 319                      | 334                      |\n| Depreciation, depletion   and amortisation | 206                      | 234                      |\n| Cost of raw materials and fuel             | 227                      | 271                      |\n| Aluminium                                  | 117                      | 111                      |\n| Electricity transmission costs             | 141                      | 158                      |\n| Other                                      | 211                      | 229                      |\n| Total cost of sales                        | 1,582                    | 1,736                    |\n\nThe Power segment's cost of sales decreased by USD 154 million, or by 8.9%, to USD 1,582 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to USD 1,736 million for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin\n\nThe following table provides the Power segment's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the years indicated:\n\n|                                           | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                  | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (HPPs)                    | 914                      | 978                      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (CHPs)                    | 30                       | 66                       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (Coal)                    | 30                       | 38                       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (Other   and unallocated) | 19                       | 45                       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                           | 993                      | 1,127                    |\n| (Power segment)                           |                          |                          |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin                    | 36.8%                    | 37.7%                    |\n| (Power segment)                           |                          |                          |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin (HPPs)             | 84.8%                    | 86.0%                    |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin (CHPs)             | 4.4%                     | 8.6%                     |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin (Coal)             | 12.8%                    | 12.9%                    |\n\nIn 2020, the Power segment's adjusted EBITDA (before intersegmental elimination) decreased by USD 134 million, or 11.9%, to USD 993 million, from USD 1,127 million in 2019. The decline was driven by a decrease in average electricity spot prices and the depreciation of the Russian rouble, but was partially offset by the increase in electricity generation volumes.\n\nAs power operations account for a sizeable portion of the revenues, assets and liabilities attributable to the Power segment, and are, therefore, a predominant contributor to the adjusted EBITDA of the Power segment, the low-cost operation of HPPs will positively affect the overall adjusted EBITDA of the Power segment. HPPs accounted for 92.1% and 86.8% of the Power segment's adjusted EBITDA in 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Power segment's adjusted EBITDA to the Power segment's results from operating activities for the periods indicated:\n\n|                                                           | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                                  | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Reconciliation of adjusted  EBITDA                        |                          |                          |\n| Results from operating activities                         | 731                      | 855                      |\n| Add:                                                      |                          |                          |\n| Amortisation and depreciation                             | 214                      | 240                      |\n| Loss/(gain) on disposal of  property, plant and equipment | (1)                      | 2                        |\n| Impairment of non current assets                          | 49                       | 30                       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                           | 993                      | 1,127                    |",

During the periods under review, short and long term funding sources predominantly included rouble and foreign currency denominated secured and unsecured loans from Russian and international banks, as well as debt instruments issued in both the Russian and international capital markets.\n\nLiquidity was managed separately in both segments - Power and Metals.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group did not declare or pay dividends.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nThe following table provides the Group's selected cash flow data for the periods indicated:\n\n|                                                                                                                       | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                                                                                              | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Cash flows from                                                                                                       | 1,890                    | 2,561                    |\n| Cash flows from/(used in)  investing activities                                                                       | (77)                     | 92                       |\n| Cash flows used in                                                                                                    | (1,372)                  | (1,588)                  |\n| Net change in cash and   cash equivalents                                                                             | 441                      | 1,065                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at                                                                                          | 2,265                    | 1,140                    |\n| the beginning of the period,  excluding restricted cash Effect of exchange rate changes  on cash and cash equivalents | (157)                    | 60                       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   at the end of the period,  excluding restricted cash 1                                    | 2,549                    | 2,265                    |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                        | 968                      | 1,614                    |\n\n## Cash flows from operating activities\n\nThe Group's cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were USD 1,890 million, a decrease of USD 671 million, or 26.2%, compared to USD 2,561 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to changes in net working capital of USD 232 million in 2020, compared to USD 885 million in 2019, apart of EBITDA change.\n\n## Cash flows generated from/(used in) investing activities\n\nThe Group's cash flows from investing activities for 2020 were USD (77) million, and were primarily attributable to capital expenditures on the acquisition of property, plant and other investments, which were partially offset by dividends received from associates and joint ventures (mainly Norilsk Nickel).\n\n## Cash flows used in financing activities\n\nThe Group's cash flows used in financing activities for 2020 were USD 1,372 million, a decrease of USD 216 million from USD 1,588 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the lower net repayment of debt and interest repayment driven by a reduction of the nominal interest rate.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the free cash flow to the cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated:\n\n|                                                                                                                  | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (USD mn)                                                                                                         | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Reconciliation of free cash flow                                                                                 |                          |                          |\n| Group                                                                                                            |                          |                          |\n| Cash flows generated                                                                                             | 1,890                    | 2,561                    |\n| from operating activities Adjusted for: Capital expenditure                                                      | (1,128)                  | (1,061)                  |\n| (acquisition of property,   plant and equipment and  acquisition of intangible assets) Dividends from associates | 1,170                    | 1,141                    |\n| Interest received                                                                                                | 56                       | 62                       |\n| Interest paid                                                                                                    | (779)                    | (1,021)                  |\n| Restructuring fees and expenses  related to issuance of shares                                                   | (26)                     | (42)                     |\n| Settlement of derivative   financial instruments                                                                 | (215)                    | (26)                     |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                   | 968                      | 1,614                    |",

All target levels for the previous year were achieved or exceeded, and the margin was subsequently decreased to 2.1% starting from August 2020.\n- -In November 2020, RUSAL negotiated new terms under the bilateral transaction with Sberbank backed by NN shares. Final maturity was extended from 2024 to 2027, and the interest rate was reduced: on the dollar tranche from 3m LIBOR+3.75% (with a floor on LIBOR = 1.0%) to 3m LIBOR+3.0% (without a floor on LIBOR) and on the rouble tranche from 9.15% to the key rate of the Bank of Russia +1.9%.\n- -On 28 January 2021, RUSAL signed the sustainabilitylinked pre-export finance facility for up to USD 200,000,000. Following the success of the first Russian sustainability-linked syndicated pre-export finance facility arranged in 2019 by international and Russian banks, RUSAL continues to pursue its ambitious decarbonisation goals. The group of international banks continues to support the Company in its aim to develop low-carbon aluminium technologies and sustainable aluminium production. The interest rate under the facility is subject to a sustainability discount or premium depending on the Company's fulfilment of the applicable key performance indicators which will be further agreed between the parties. The proceeds were used to refinance more expensive debt.\n- -In March, RUSAL announced signing and starting the drawdown of a syndicated loan agreement for up to RUB 45 billion with VTB and Gazprombank. As part of the loan agreement, VTB will provide RUB 30 billion, whilst Gazprombank will provide RUB 15 billion. The term of financing is up to 15 years. The funds raised will be used to help finance the completion of the start-up phase of the TaAZ smelter and partial refinancing of investments made in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Debt capital markets\n\n- -On 20 March 2020, the Group repaid the first tranche of Panda bonds and redeemed bonds with a notional value of CNY 320 million (USD 46 million).\n- -On 9 June 2020, placement of the exchange-traded rouble bonds of RUSAL Bratsk series B\u041e-002\u0420-01 in an amount of RUB 10 billion with a 6.5% coupon rate was completed and the exchange-traded rouble bonds commenced trading on the Moscow Exchange. Maturity of the bonds is ten years subject to a bondholders' put option exercisable in June 2023. In addition to the placement, the Group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, which resulted in an exchange-traded rouble bonds exposure in the amount of RUB 10 billion being translated into a US dollar exposure with a maturity of 3 years and an interest rate of 2.90%.\n- -In July 2020, RUSAL launched a tender offer and purchased from investors and redeemed Eurobonds for a total amount of USD 88.5 million.\n- -On 4 September 2020, RUSAL repaid and redeemed the second tranche of Panda bonds with a notional value of CNY 20 million (USD 3 million).\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe summary of the Group's principal contingencies is set out below. For a detailed discussion of the Group's contingencies in 2020, including environmental contingencies, risks and considerations, see Note 22 of the Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Taxation\n\nRussian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management's interpretation of such legislation, as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group, may be challenged by the relevant local, regional or federal authorities. Recent developments suggest that the Russian authorities are becoming more active in seeking to enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of tax legislation, in particular in relation to the use of certain commercial trading structures, which may be selective for particular tax payers and different from the authorities' previous interpretations or practices. Recent events within the\n\nRussian Federation suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive and substance-based position in their interpretation and enforcement of tax legislation.\n\nTax risks attributable to the Group, together with an estimate of the maximum possible additional amounts which may reasonably become payable in respect of such risks, are disclosed in Note 22 (a) of the Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nThe Group's business activities expose it to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and contested on an ongoing basis. Where management believes that a lawsuit or another claim would result in an outflow of economic benefits for the Group, a best estimate of such outflow is included in provisions in the consolidated financial statements (Note 22 (\u0441)). As at 31 December 2020, the amount of claims where management assesses outflow as possible is approximately USD 21 million (31 December 2019: USD 21 million).\n\n## Financial ratios\n\n## Gearing\n\nThe Group's gearing ratio - the ratio of total debt (including both long-term and short-term borrowings and bonds outstanding) to total assets - as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, was 54.7% and 51.9%, respectively.\n\n## Return on equity\n\nThe Group's return on equity - the amount of net profit as a percentage of total equity - was 16.8% and 17.7% as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively.\n\n## Interest coverage ratio\n\nThe Group's interest coverage ratio - the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to net interest for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, was 1.4x and 1.1x, respectively.",

Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in power and aluminium prices, foreign exchange rates, production\n\nrates and costs. These forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. After making enquiries of management, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue in operation and meet its commitments as they fall due. Accordingly, the Directors believe that adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements is appropriate.\n\n## Report on payments to governments\n\nThe table below shows the amounts paid by the Group's entities to public authorities (primarily in the form of miscellaneous taxes and levies) in connection with their extraction activities:\n\n|            | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)   | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)                                 | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)   | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)   | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)                 | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)                                                                         | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)       | Type of payment 2020 ('000 USD)   |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|            | Production  fees                  | Taxes or  levies on  corporate  sales,  production   or profits | Royalties                         | Dividends                         | Signing-on,  discovery and  production  bonuses | Licence fees,  rental  charges, entry  fees and other  consideration  for licences  and/or  concessions | Infrastructure  improvement  payments | TOTAL                             |\n| Russia     | -                                 | 36,489                                                          | -                                 | -                                 | -                                               | 4,506                                                                                                   | 2,808                                 | 43,803                            |\n| Kazakhstan | -                                 | 24,505                                                          | -                                 | -                                 | -                                               | 1,141                                                                                                   | 252                                   | 25,898                            |\n| Ukraine    | -                                 | 51                                                              | -                                 | -                                 | -                                               | 36                                                                                                      | 0                                     | 88                                |\n| Guinea     | -                                 | 5,663                                                           | -                                 | -                                 | -                                               | -                                                                                                       | -                                     | 5,663                             |\n| Guyana     | -                                 | 48                                                              | 132                               | -                                 | -                                               | 124                                                                                                     | -                                     | 305                               |\n| Jamaica    | -                                 | 214                                                             | 722                               | -                                 | -                                               | 63                                                                                                      | -                                     | 998                               |\n| Total      | -                                 | 66,971                                                          | 854                               | -                                 | -                                               | 5,871                                                                                                   | 3,060                                 | 76,755                            |",

        "page_content": "The Group's SDG focus can be categorised as centred around the well-being of personnel and local communities, the responsible use of natural resources, the mitigation of the Company's impact on the environment, and climate leadership. Understanding that partnerships and collaboration play a vital role in helping achieve sustainability ambitions, in 2019 En+ Group added SDG 17 'Partnerships for the Goals' to the existing seven SDGs as key objectives for our business.\n\nIn 2019, En+ Group joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and is firmly committed to its Ten Principles covering human rights, labour standards, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. In addition, the Group is also an active member of the UNGC Local Network in Russia and En+ Group's Director for Sustainable Development, Anton Butmanov, was elected to the Russian Local Network's Governing Council in 2020.\n\nThe Group is a member of several international sustainability associations and initiatives established either under the auspices of, or in partnership with, the UNGC. These include the CEO Water Mandate, an initiative that mobilises business leaders on issues around water, sanitation, and sustainable use of water resources, and focuses on SDG 6.\n\nSince 2019, the Group has been a signatory of the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign, an urgent call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, businesses and industry leaders to make a valuable and necessary contribution to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Pledging to align our emission reduction targets with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the Group formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as well as to developing and submitting the new targets for validation by August 2021.\n\nThroughout 2020, we continued to develop our relationship with the International Hydropower Association (IHA) and the 'Hydropower of Russia' Association. The Chairs and members of the Boards of En+ Group and IHA discussed Principles of Sustainable Hydropower and a new mission to position hydropower at the top of energy transition discussions.\n\nThe ASI Performance Standard is widely accepted as the exclusive sustainability standard for the entire aluminium value chain. The Standard was developed through interaction between industry players, consumers and NGOs. The requirements of the Standard encompass eleven sets of criteria, incl. business ethics, governance, environmental aspects, human rights and social aspects. In 2020, five of RUSAL's smelters, i.e. Boguchansky aluminum smelter (BoAZ), Bratsk aluminum smelter (BrAZ), Krasnoyarsk aluminum smelter (KrAZ), KUBAL (Kubikenborg aluminum AB) and Sayanogorsk aluminum smelter (SAZ), were ASI certified and were included in the effective ASI certificates of RUSAL. This brings the number of the RUSAL's sites certified against the ASI Performance Standard to nine after the management company and three RUSAL's other facilities, i.e. Bauxite Timana (bauxite mining), Urals Aluminium Smelter (alumina production) and Irkutsk Aluminium Smelter (aluminium production, casting and alloy manufacturing), were audited for certification. RUSAL also plans to have its other facilities certified. In 2021, Alexey Spirin, Director of Environmental and Climate Risk Management Department, was the successful candidate voted in by ASI members at ASI's annual Board elections, to a Production and Transformation seat.",

We have doubled down on our work to address these issues and make a meaningful contribution to the achievement of identified SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clean water and sanitation\n\nWorking with a range of relevant stakeholders, we collaborate on Lake Baikal conservation programmes built on measurable goals.\n\n## Monitoring the water quality and ecology of Lake Baikal\n\nIn 2019, we established a scientific programme to monitor the water quality and ecology of Lake Baikal. A team of environmental experts from a range of academic and scientific institutions have focused on the content of microplastic and heavy metals in the water, disease of natural Baikal sponges and the development of filamentous algae Spirogyra; as the programme progresses their scope may extend to aquatic biological resources, the endemic seal population and isotopes.\n\n## Safe workplaces\n\nEn+ Group is dedicated to creating and upholding a culture of health and safety at every one of our facilities around the world, with an absolute commitment to ongoing improvement of H&S management and processes.\n\n## Leading medical and emergency healthcare in Guinea\n\nWe have Bauxite mining facilities across Guinea, run through two separate operating divisions of RUSAL. Both offer staff access to high quality medical care. In addition, we have been leading the private sector response to Ebola in Guinea since 2014 when the country experienced a major and devastating outbreak of the deadly disease in 2020 we also transformed the Ebola centre to a COVID-19 treatment facility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Affordable and clean energy\n\nWe own and operate some of the world's largest hydropower plants. We aim to increase the efficiency of our hydropower infrastructure and drive better performance through our long-term New Energy Programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Modernisation and improvement\n\nOur 'New Energy Programme', launched in 2007, is delivering wide-scale modernisation of our largest hydropower plants in Siberia. Through this programme we are on track to generate 2.5 TWh more electricity from the same amount of water passing through our turbines by 2025, securing accessible power for the people of Siberia and helping to reduce C0 2 emissions by 2.5m tonnes annually from 2025.\n\n## Decent work and economic growth\n\nAll our facilities comply with our policies on human rights, labour rights, and industrial safety standards, ensuring all staff throughout enjoy the same level of job security and safe working conditions.\n\n## Local jobs for local people\n\nAt our facilities outside of Russia, our strict policy is to always recruit from the local population first and to only bring staff in from overseas when the necessary skills cannot be found among the regional communities. All our roles are immediately advertised to those living near our operations and we provide preliminary training for all those seeking employment.",

We are now also using the latest technology to treat the residue for reuse, for example as an inorganic polymer for construction materials. In 2019 we developed the capabilities to extract alkali from bauxite residue and in 2020 we are testing de-alkalised residue to assess its potential uses in construction.\n\n## Environmental monitoring\n\nWe conduct a wide range of long-term projects aimed at maintaining and preserving the biological diversity of nature reserves. The Group has been monitoring the direct impact of our aluminium smelters on the environment. Our comprehensive monitoring programmes include surveys of the quality and condition of soil, plants, water, bed sediments and snow cover. The monitoring provides us with data that we use to assess the current condition of the environment and to design solutions to reduce the potential environmental impacts of our industrial facilities. Importantly, the research results also represent a unique and regularly updated scientific database on the ecosystems. One example is a long-term project to assist in the study and conservation of the Snow Leopard, a rare species that lives in the unique Altai-Sayan ecoregion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate action\n\nWe have two critical focuses: optimising low-carbon aluminium production today; and investing in the development of tomorrow's technologies that have the potential to remove GHG emissions from the smelting process.\n\n## ALLOW - RUSAL's low-carbon aluminium\n\nIn 2017, RUSAL launched ALLOW, its own brand of low-carbon primary aluminium. By 2019, more than 78% of all the aluminium produced by RUSAL was lowcarbon. ALLOW is crafted by renewable hydropower and is available globally. The carbon footprint of ALLOW (at smelter, Scope 1&2, which corresponds to Level 1 in the International Aluminium Institute's Technical Guidance Document) is less than 4 tonnes of CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium, and is approximately four times lower than the industry average. ALLOW aluminium comes with independently verified statements of its carbon footprint, traceable to individual smelters, ensuring transparency and enabling customers to make better-informed decisions about the primary aluminium they procure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww .enplusgroup.com/upload/ iblock/7f5/ En\\_-Group-Green-Aluminium-Vision.\n\npdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partnerships for the goals\n\nWe are committed to working closely with industry peers, policymakers, academics, IGOs, NGOs and civil society; as well as to sharing our data and intelligence for the development of solutions.\n\n## Carbon Clarity\n\nOur Carbon Clarity programme was set to encourage enhanced emissions disclosure throughout the aluminium industry, empowering customers with the information they need to make sustainable choices. We also released a guide to our own emissions and have instigated an ongoing campaign calling on the London Metal Exchange to implement mandatory disclosure for all the aluminium it lists.",

Continuous improvements to our existing environmental management system are based on the application of the core values of our Environmental Policy, which was adopted by the Board of Directors in December 2020.\n\nWe operate our facilities in accordance with local and international legal requirements and establish voluntary environmental projects. Every year, the Group invests in technological development, equipment modernisation programmes, enhanced production efficiency, and environmental protection activities.\n\nMain production facilities that are either owned by En+ Group entities or are under our operational control successfully apply our environmental management system, which is based on ISO 14001:2015 and is aimed at the reasonable use of natural resources and mitigation of adverse environmental impacts.\n\nEnvironmental risk management is carried out in accordance with internally approved procedures. We record any inconsistencies identified through governmental supervision or voluntary audits, and develop and implement corrective measures.\n\nBeyond the Group's own footprint, we provide customers with reliable access to renewable power sources, enabling them to reduce their own carbon footprints. In 2020, En+ Group's Krasnoyarsk HPP became Russia's first power plant to sell energy attribute certificates in accordance with the I-REC Standard, opening Russia to the I-REC market. Our Metals segment produces more than 90% of its aluminium using lowcarbon renewable hydropower energy, substantially reducing the carbon footprint of its products.\n\nIn 2020, there were no major 1 incidents related to spillage, air, water or soil pollution; there were no related claims filed and no fines imposed.\n\n## Climate change\n\nEn+ Group is committed to being a world leader in addressing climate change and environmental issues. We are set to reduce the Group's carbon footprint and work with a wide range of partners to enhance our global policy and the industry's response. Due to the energy-intensive nature of our businesses, minimising the climate impacts of the production processes is one of our most important strategic objectives. In January 2021, the Group announced targets of a reduction of at least 35% in GHG emissions by 2030 and to be net zero by 2050. While there is already an established GHG reduction strategy in the Metals segment, we are now developing an integrated strategy for the entire Group to achieve these targets.\n\n## TCFD\n\nEn+ Group is currently developing its corporate format for disclosing financial data related to climate change based on a set of recommendations from the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the 'TCFD').\n\nThe TCFD disclosure of climate change risks project consists of two phases:\n\n- -Disclosure of climate change risks by the Metals segment\n- -Disclosure of climate change risks by the Power segment\n\nUnder both phases, climate change risks will be identified and recorded. After that, we will be developing more detailed plans to minimise these risks. Our next steps are to identify the five most significant risks and to develop several scenarios to mitigate them. The results of this work will be presented in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) report for 2020. We will provide more information about the implementation of TCFD recommendations in our Sustainability Report 2020.\n\n## Since 2019, JSC Irkutskenergo has led WWF Russia's information transparency rating of Russian fuel and energy companies\n\nJSC Irkutskenergo, which manages the Group's energy assets in the Irkutsk Region, has topped the ranking of Russian power companies for transparency on environmental responsibility for two consecutive years. Compiled by WWF Russia, the rating covers fossil fuel powered heat and electricity production. The rating was published on 22 December 2020, the 100th anniversary of the adoption of the Soviet plan for national economic recovery and development, GOELRO.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, the Company continued to roll out one of Russia's largest reforestation and forest protection projects and funded the planting of more than 112 thousand trees in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Irkutsk Region, and continued aerial forest protection of more than 500 thousand hectares of the lower Yenisei forestry in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.\n\nThe main source of GHG emissions in the Power segment are the CHPs of LLC Baikal Energy Company (until 1 September 2020, JSC Irkutskenergo) which provides heat and electricity to consumers by burning fossil fuels. The amount of fossil fuels burnt depends on the mix and volume of heat and electricity loads. The dynamics of fuel consumption for heat supply largely depend on the outdoor temperature. Fuel consumption for electricity supply is mainly influenced by market demand for electricity generation through the condensation cycle. Over the last three years, peak electricity generation for the condensation cycle occurred in 2018 (which was also the coldest) and amounted to 6.1 TWh (5.3 TWh in 2019, 4.7 TWh in 2020). This peak was also a result of a low water season in Lake Baikal and a decrease in electricity generation at HPPs. In 2018, the average outdoor temperature in Irkutsk during the heating period dropped to -8.3\u00b0C (-6.1\u00b0C in 2017, -7.1\u00b0C in 2019, -6.1\u00b0C in 2020).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New Energy Programme\n\nIn 2020, the modernisation programme enabled En+ Group to avoid GHG emissions by 2 Mt by partially replacing energy demand from coal-fired power plants with HPP output. Our increased renewable power generation substitutes power produced by coal-fired plants in Siberia when operating in condensing mode (the most inefficient mode where only power is produced).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProjects\n\n- 1 Preliminary data, being verified as part of En+ Group 2020 Sustainability report preparation.\n- 2  Figures for Power segment were recalculated because of improvement in methodology.",

Commissioning of this small-scale HPP is slated for the end of 2022.\n\n## The Metals segment's GHG emissions in electrolysis operations\n\nThe Group's Metals segment places special emphasis on minimising climate impact by applying the highest international standards of quality and governance to the entire production chain, fully compliant with the requirements of the new green economy. One of RUSAL's corporate targets in minimising anthropogenic impact on the climate system is a reduction of the direct GHG emissions per tonne of aluminium produced from the existing electrolysis operations by 15% compared to\n\n## ALLOW\n\nCarbon labelling is an appropriate takeaway from the new approach to decarbonisation, based on international, regional, national and local initiatives to limit GHG concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. The demand for climate-friendly goods is clearly growing among consumers. In 2017, En+ Group's unique integrated supply chain enabled its Metals segment to start offering its proprietary aluminium brand, ALLOW. ALLOW aluminium is manufactured with a total level of GHG emissions from both smelter and power generation (providing energy for electrolysis) of less than 4 tonnes of CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium. Industry average emissions are around 12,5 tonnes of CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium. The Group verified its primary aluminium alloys in accordance with the criteria of the ALLOW brand in 2020 with the help of the international audit company, T\u00dcV Austria. 78% of the Company's primary aluminium output was confirmed to be compliant with the criteria attributed to this brand. The calculations followed the Aluminium Carbon Footprint Technical Support Document developed by the International Aluminium Institute.\n\nthe 2014 baseline level by 2025. In 2020, RUSAL achieved an 11% reduction 1 in its direct GHG emissions per tonne of electrolysis operations versus the 2014 level, which is fully in line with the phased schedule to achieve these targets.

        "page_content": "The Company has a long-standing commitment to investment in Research & Development and innovation. The introduction of our unique inert anode technology will help us to dramatically cut the environmental impact of our aluminium production. Using inert anodes completely eliminates emissions of greenhouse gases (CO and CO 2 ), polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene and sulphur from the reduction process. Another positive result of this technology is the generation of oxygen in the aluminium production process.\n\n## Air emissions (excluding GHG emissions)\n\nEn+ Group is committed to reducing the negative impact it may have on the atmosphere. We are implementing a number of initiatives to ensure that technological improvements, which contribute to emissions reduction, are carried out in a timely manner. We comply with all the necessary internal and government regulations in all our countries of operation.\n\nThe Metals segment's key initiatives to reduce its negative impact on the atmosphere are:\n\n- -Implementing Eco-S\u00f8derberg technology (at KrAZ, BrAZ, IrkAZ, and NkAZ)\n- -Constructing and modernising gas treatment plants (at BrAZ, IrkAZ, NkAZ, KUBAL, UAZ and Achinsk Alumina Refinery).\n\nJSC Irkutskenergo upgraded the electrostatic precipitators at Novo-Irkutsk CHP and Novo-Ziminskaya CHP, and replaced ash traps at CHP-6 and UICHP to reduce pollutant output. One of the Group's main projects to reduce the environmental impact of its Metals segment is the introduction of advanced and highly efficient dry gas treatment facilities, which will capture up to 99.8% of both hydrogen fluoride and the solid fluorides present in exhaust gases in the smelter's reduction area. This will reduce not only the gross emissions from the production facility, but also the amount of gas treatment waste disposed at specialised landfills. Since 2018, we have been implementing a comprehensive plan to reduce emissions in Russian cities, including Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk, as a part of the Ecology national project and Clean Air federal programme. The latter aims to reduce the level of air pollution in large industrial centres, including a\n\nreduction of at least 20% of the total emissions of pollutants into the atmospheric air by 2024 in the 12 most environmentally problematic cities of Russia: Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, Lipetsk, Magnitogorsk, Mednogorsk, Nizhny Tagil, Novokuznetsk, Norilsk, Omsk, Chelyabinsk, Cherepovets and Chita. The programme will significantly improve the air quality in these cities (below limits) and quality of life of the citizens. We will be contributing to this programme's ambitious goal.\n\n## Water resources\n\nEn+ Group facilities draw water from both surface and underground sources for operational and production needs. Alumina refineries and power facilities are the Group's biggest water consumers due to their technological requirements and processes. The Company rarely suffers from water shortages at our facilities and there are currently no critical water-related risks (water consumption or disposal).\n\nThe most important areas of the Group's efforts to minimise our impact on water resources are:\n\n- -Reducing fresh water consumption\n- -Reducing wastewater discharge and concentration of pollutants in waste water\n- -Increasing recycled water volumes",

RUSAL has been involved in CDP since 2015, informing stakeholders about its products' carbon footprint, climate risk assessments, and climate targets. CDP aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm, and drive disclosure, insight and action towards a sustainable economy. We are also committed to fully disclosing greenhouse gas emissions from our aluminium, alumina, bauxite and other facilities.\n\nThe International Aluminium Institute (IAI), of which RUSAL has been a member since 2002, collects statistical and other relevant information, encourages and assists in the continuous progress in the safe and environmentally sound production of aluminium, and communicates the views and positions of the aluminium industry to international agencies and other relevant parties.\n\nEn+ Group is a member of the Climate Partnership of Russia, which was created on the eve of the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21, to consolidate Russian businesses' efforts to reduce environmental impacts. In 2020, the Group participated in sessions organised by the Partnership, where Lord Barker joined Nigel Topping, High Level Climate Action Champion for UNFCCC, and Ruslan Edelgiriev, Adviser to the Russian President and Special Presidential Representative on Climate Issues, to discuss their vision for the upcoming COP26 climate conference.\n\nWe continue to cooperate with the Aluminium for Climate initiative. The initiative is part of the World Economic Forum's Mission Possible platform, created to accelerate the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries. The initiative is a platform that brings together the most active leaders of the international aluminium industry and aims to achieve industry consensus on decarbonisation by 2050. In 2020, the Aluminium for Climate initiative worked closely with the organisational committee of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, to bring the industry to the forefront of the energy-intensive sectors. As decarbonisation cannot be achieved in each industry in isolation, both the Aluminium for Climate and the Mission Possible platform worked to broaden crosssectoral collaboration in 2020.\n\n## Lake Baikal\n\nThe Group owns and manages operations at three of the four HPPs (excluding Boguchany HPP) located on the Angara, the only river that exits Lake Baikal.\n\nLake Baikal provides ca. 60% of water used by these power plants to generate energy.\n\nThe eastern Siberian lake, declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1996, is the largest and deepest freshwater lake on earth. The lake and its coastal zone create a unique habitat for numerous plant and animal species, many of which are endemic.\n\nThe problems facing Lake Baikal were the subject of extensive discussions in many forums in 2020, with a particular focus on regulating environmental restrictions for the Central Environmental Zone of the Baikal natural territory, which is affected by transportation infrastructure and water level regulation.\n\nWater level regulation is a special item on the Group's agenda as state regulation of the lake's water levels directly affects the operating modes of Irkutsk HPP. Our long-term inflow forecasting project (ENvision) continued in 2020 and will provide us with more precise forecasts of the HPP output, and will help the authorities improve the lake water level management practices.\n\nTogether with WWF Russia, the Group initiated a project to assess and report on the environmental and social problems of the Baikal natural territory in order to establish wide scale dialogue and to find new solutions. WWF Russia launched a campaign to encourage experts to join the effort.\n\nThe Group pays special attention to the lake's environmental condition. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we sponsored the implementation of a series of new projects for monitoring and research into the condition of the lake and its inhabitants.

We are actively developing new waste management sites, as well as renovating and modernising existing facilities to make sure waste is disposed of and stored safely. All our waste management sites are compliant with the necessary regulations.\n\n## Alumina and aluminium production waste\n\nThe most significant types of waste in terms of volume are bauxite and nepheline residue, which are considered to be non-toxic waste. They represent over 80% of the total waste generated by RUSAL. In cooperation with R&D centres and institutions, RUSAL is developing and applying new methods of specific waste reduction at its aluminium smelting and alumina refining facilities. The smelters and refineries are actively seeking to reduce solid waste and residue storage facilities.\n\nResidue volumes are directly related to the dynamics of production and other factors, such as the depth of ore beds and the alumina content present in processed ore and bauxites.\n\n## Ash and slag waste\n\nThe volumes of generated ash and slag waste depend directly on the volumes of heat and electricity generated at CHPs, as well as coal combustion parameters. JSC Irkutskenergo seeks out, develops and applies new methods of ash waste disposal in cooperation with leading R&D institutions and production companies.\n\nWe relentlessly strive to find new methods of ash waste utilisation and treatment. The following measures are currently in place to enhance our waste treatment:\n\n- -Raising the volume of fly ash disposal - modernisation of Novo-Irkutsk CHP's dry ash discharge plant\n- -Extracting iron bearing concentrate - a pilot plant at CHP-9\n- -Sales of ash waste to manufacturers of construction materials\n- -Production of ash and slag material for the reclamation of waste disposal facilities and coal reserves\n\nIn 2020, the following additional measures were initiated:\n\n- -R&D on the use of ash and slag for road beds\n- -A pilot project for the environmentally safe use of ash and slag for reclamation and backfilling of disturbed land\n- -A project for dry storage of ash and slag mixtures at the Novo-Ziminskaya CHP\n- -A project for dry storage of SHS of CHP-9 and CHP-10 at the ash and slag dump of CHP-9 section No. 1.\n\n## Tailing dams management\n\nIn 2019, there were major dam disasters on different sides of the globe. En+ Group operates several large tailing dams and safety at these dams is a key priority for us. For this reason, we closely monitor and analyse the causes of such disastrous events in order to learn lessons and prevent similar situations at our own facilities.\n\nTo prevent any accidents and significant impact on the environment, bauxite and nepheline residue storage areas together with ash and slag waste storage areas are subject to comprehensive control.\n\n- -Hydraulic structures are inspected daily and periodically, and their condition is constantly monitored by instrumentation\n- -We carry out certification of personnel operating the hydraulic structures and provide professional development for technicians who perform technical supervision of safety at hydraulic structures\n- -We are studying the use of the dry bauxite and nepheline residue stacking process, which uses press filters and eliminates the impact of the liquid phase on the safety of mud disposal areas",

In line with our accounting policy, the expected costs of decommissioning facilities and restoring the environment are reflected in our international financial statements as reserves.\n\nRestoration of disturbed land is carried out in the following areas:\n\n- -Restoring disturbed terrain and soil fertility once mining activity (open-pit mining) is finished\n- -Rehabilitating production and consumption waste disposal facilities (ash dumps, landfills, etc.)\n- -Rehabilitating disturbed and contaminated land.\n\n## Energy\n\nEn+ Group's core strategy for energy production and consumption is threefold: the uninterrupted supply of electricity and heat to third-party consumers; the increase of electricity generation at hydropower plants; and the reduction of grid losses and internal consumption of energy at generating facilities.\n\nSpecial-purpose programmes and energy efficiency projects are in place at all of the Group's entities. Energy saving technologies are widely employed - from the optimisation of energy generation modes and equipment designs, to the reduction of heat losses and adoption of optimised maintenance procedures within the technical and technological parameters of operations.\n\nWith hydropower fuelling more than 90% of RUSAL's aluminium output, we strive to minimise our industrial carbon footprint through the implementation of energy efficiency measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental monitoring of Lake Baikal\n\nLake Baikal is an important natural site within the impact zones of the Power segment's production facilities. En+ Group recognises its share of responsibility for the environmental well-being of the lake and takes efforts to support and preserve its biodiversity. In 2020, the second annual expedition for environmental monitoring of Lake Baikal was carried out to obtain unbiased data on the condition of the lake's ecosystems. In addition to defining the overall hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water, the monitoring also explored the microplastics content in the surface water layer and included water sampling from the Selenga River upstream and downstream of Ulan-Ude and from the Angara River upstream and downstream of the Irkutsk HPP. More water samples were taken from drinking wells in the residential areas located on the banks of Lake Baikal.\n\nHydrochemical analyses of the water samples showed that the main pollutants entered Lake Baikal through the Selenga River. An important result of the expedition is the scientific confirmation of the hypothesis that biogenic substances come to the lake through groundwaters from the residential areas. The key findings of the Baikal environmental monitoring were presented at the All-Russian Water Congress in October 2020.",

For example, AAL has achieved a 40% reduction in tonnes of carbon per tonne of alumina production over the past 15 years. In addition, management of the Bauxite Residue Disposal Area (BRDA) at AAL is an example of the Group's best practices in land rehabilitation and waste management. AAL implemented best available technology to treat the residue by using industrial mud farming process. Vegetation and screening programmes have been in place for many years to improve visual perspectives. One of AAL's priorities is to develop ways to reuse the bauxite residue (BR).\n\nIn this regard, AAL is active in many European projects aimed at developing bauxite reuse technologies. It is a partner of EIT Raw Materials, a major global commodity consortium, funded by EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology), a body of the European Union. The consortium's strategic goal is to turn raw materials into a powerful force for Europe. Throughout 2020, AAL continued to participate in the RECOVER project, launched in 2016, to develop a new technology for the reuse of bauxite residue for the production of technically complex products such as inorganic polymers. The technology used in the project is a high temperature sintering of bauxite residue to produce a vitrified material similar to copper residue (called slag). The vitrified material is cooled, ground and blended with alkali solution to produce a dense inorganic polymer. Other additives such as surfactant and alumina powder are used to produce porous inorganic polymer. The products from the process will be used in construction materials, namely dense blocks for non-load bearing construction, fire retardant panels and porous blocks. The construction of a four-module pilot plant was completed in 2020. Each module of this pilot plant is a custom-made container equipped with benchmark branded equipment. The first two sections deal specifically with bauxite residue and the last two containers are used to produce inorganic polymer from copper residue.\n\nIn 2020, a Pilot Plant and Product Demonstration Event was hosted at AAL. This was a significant milestone of the RECOVER project. The event, which took place online due to COVID-19 restrictions, showcased the flagship products and technologies developed during the project. Of particular interest to AAL were the artefacts made with bauxite residue.\n\nAAL is also part of RemovAL, which is a large research project funded by the EU. The main premise of RemovAL is that no single technology option is viable for bulk reuse of bauxite residue and that more than one element must be combined to achieve viable and meaningful utilisation. AAL in association with industry partners is developing and piloting Residue Dealkalisation to reduce the soda content of residue to <0.5% making it usable in the iron and cement industries. Other projects in RemovAL include the production of Lightweight Aggregates for building applications, converting bauxite residue into ready-made mortar for the synthesis of inorganic polymers and the production of pig iron and ferro-silica alloys. In 2021, AAL will construct and demonstrate the use of BR, along with other waste materials such as fly ash, in road construction. This will be demonstrated on the BRDA at AAL.\n\nAAL is also participating in a third EU research project, ReActiv, launched in November 2020. Coordinated by LafargeHoclim, the biggest cement producer in Europe, the ReActiv project will create a novel sustainable symbiotic value chain, linking by-products of the alumina production industry and the cement production industry. Through ReActiv, modification will be made to both the alumina production and the cement production side of the chain, linking them through the new ReActiv technologies. The ReActiv technologies will modify the properties of the industrial residue, transforming it into an active material suitable for new, low-carbon cement products.",

Our core production facilities are located in Siberia which has unique indigenous plants and wildlife. We strive to apply the world's best practices in the field of biodiversity. We cooperate with research and educational institutions and non-governmental organisations to develop effective measures of preserving ecosystems.\n\n## Biodiversity preservation\n\nFor several years, the Group has conducted monitoring in the regions of operations. This monitoring provides data that we use to assess the current condition of the environment and make adjustments to environmental protection activities and design solutions to reduce the negative impact of industrial development. These research materials represent a unique and regularly updated scientific database of the natural areas of Russia's northern regions.\n\n## Baikal seal preservation programme\n\nThe Baikal seal is the only mammal that lives in Lake Baikal and is endemic to the region. The seal at the top of the food chain in the Baikal ecosystem, and its condition allows us to draw conclusions about the quality of its habitat, i.e. the Baikal ecosystem as a whole. That is why it needs to be constantly monitored primarily, its migrations and health.\n\nEn+ Group and the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences signed a cooperation agreement in the end of 2019, which envisages inter alia preservation of biodiversity, including the Baikal seal preservation programme. En+ Group and other partners of the Institute joined a comprehensive programme to preserve the Baikal seal through 2025. In 20192020, as part of the programme, scientists carried out an expedition to count the seal population and to attach satellite trackers to several seals (to monitor their migration routes); analyses were conducted to define the health of the animals. We also made a contribution to this work by transferring the findings of the Lake Baikal environmental monitoring.\n\n## Conservation of aquatic biological resources\n\nFor the past six years, En+ Group has been successfully carrying out the restoration of aquatic biological resources. Over this period, more than 1.5 million young peled (northern whitefish) have been released into the waters of the Angara region. The species is a relative of cisco and omul, reaching an adult weight of 2-2.5 kg. The cultivation of young fish for replenishment of fish stocks is carried out annually at fish hatcheries that specialise in the reproduction of valuable fish species.\n\nThrough this programme, young Siberian sturgeons were released into the Yenisei River in 2020 as a result of cooperation between Krasnoyarsk HPP and the Yenisei branch of FGUP Glavrybvod. The young fish were grown at the Beloyarsky fish farm built in 1973 to compensate for damage to aquatic biodiversity inflicted by the construction of Krasnoyarsk HPP.\n\nIn total, our production facilities released about 253,000 young peled and 2,300 young sturgeons into the waters of the Angara basin and 12,400 young Siberian sturgeons into the Yenisei River.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The HSE Committee ensures that the Company has in place a proper system for the management of health and safety risks. Our principles and commitments are set out in the Health, Occupational, Industrial and Fire Safety (abbreviated as 'OHS') policy.\n\nThe Group complies with both legal health and safety requirements and its own internal standards, which are often stricter than the rules prescribed by legislation.\n\nWe arrange all necessary health and safety briefings and training sessions and carry out health and safety audits to ensure that all employees appreciate the importance of their own safety. In order to ensure the health and safety of our employees, we constantly review our existing occupational health and safety management system, and look for new and innovative ways of promoting safe working practices among our employees.\n\nThe Group monitors, records and investigates all incidents regardless of severity. This includes incidents resulting in micro-injuries, and instances of employees' health deteriorating over a period of time. The findings of these investigations are used to develop and implement corrective actions, intended to prevent future accidents or occupational health impacts. Protecting human life and health from threats related to industrial factors, or from consequences of accidents, is our highest priority.\n\n## Health and Safety performance\n\nEn+ Group deeply regrets that there were four workrelated fatalities in 2020 notwithstanding En+ Group's commitment to the zero fatalities concept.

The main aim of this plan is the gradual improvement of health and safety indicators through a series of projects, some of which were implemented in 2020.\n\nAs part of the Self-Dismissal programme, every employee is guaranteed the right to refuse work that poses a risk of injury. Compliance with this programme is ensured at each of En+ Group's enterprises by our plant managers.\n\nWe developed and adopted a set of Basic and Fundamental Safety Rules for our production facilities. In addition we formally regulating numerous processes to ensure the proper condition of scaffolding and platforms, organising works involving hoisting mechanisms, ensuring the safe traffic of vehicles and pedestrians at production sites, using video recorders in admission to operations, and switching power devices.\n\nAdmission to work sites in terms of employees' blood alcohol content prior to each work shift in line with tour alcohol and drug zero tolerance policy continues to be controlled. Daily medical examinations using Automated Medical Examination software/hardware were introduced in 2020 to detect any deterioration of employee health at workplaces located at remote power generation or transmission facilities in the Irkutsk Region.\n\nA health and safety monitoring project continued in the Power segment in 2020. The project combines reactive and proactive health and safety performance indicators at all production sites into one integrated metric, used continuously to monitor and adjust health and safety efforts. The ongoing monitoring indicator is also used as a KPI to determine the size of the quarterly bonus. In 2020, managers continued to hold monthly HSE meetings by video conference, where directors of the production facilities reported on the results of their HSE efforts, discussed the findings of workplace audits and shared experiences in health and safety improvements.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the production safety management system in the Metals segment was transitioned from the OHSAS 18001: 2007 standard to the international ISO 45001: 2018 standard, as confirmed by the DNV GL certificate (international accredited registrar and classification society).\n\nIn 2020, an external audit of the health and safety management system and the level of safety culture was conducted at four sites of the Metals segment. Based on the assessment results, a roadmap for the further development of the production safety management system was developed.\n\nTo prevent accidents such as the serious damage which occurred on the territory of CHP-3 in Norilsk, owned by the Norilsk Nickel Company, we implemented the following actions at the enterprises of the Metals segment:\n\n- -Expert assessment of the reliability and safety of 36 ground storage tanks, used for chemical substances and oil products with a volume of more than 1,000 m 3\n- -Technical audit of hazardous production facilities at five sites (AGK, BrAZ, IrkAZ, SAZ, KrAZ)\n- -Compliance verification of draft conclusions of industrial safety examination for technical devices, buildings and structures operated at hazardous production facilities at five enterprises (AGK, BrAZ, IrkAZ, SAZ, KrAZ)\n\nBased on the results of the measures taken, the enterprises developed and implemented corrective actions, intended to prevent future accidents.\n\nIn 2020 the Metals segment implemented piloted an automated information system 'Production safety RUSAL' at two sites in Krasnoyarsk (KrAZ) and Achinsk (AGK).\n\n## Goals for 2021:\n\n- -Achieve zero fatalities\n- -Control and reduce all injuries, including contractors\n- -Improve safety culture with a priority focus on the personal safe behaviour of each employee",

We invest in community projects that align with the needs of local people, as well as our business activities. For this reason, our community engagement priorities lie in urban development, healthy living, education, the environment, and volunteering. In 2020, the En+ Group allocated over USD 71 million 1 for social investments and charitable\n\nprojects. Since the beginning of 2020, the world has faced the unprecedented challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic, which has had a devastating impact on the lives of individuals, families and communities and put national economies under tremendous long-term pressure. We strengthened our work to address these issues alongside the further development of our established community initiatives.\n\n## Our response to the coronavirus pandemic\n\nLike every other company, the coronavirus pandemic has affected our operations and, critically, has had an impact on En+ Group staff, current and former. The health and well-being of our people has been our number one priority and is at the heart of our multifaceted response to the emergency.\n\nOur first step was to take fast and decisive action to protect our workforces around the world. More than 15,000 staff started working from home on 18 March. Our Health and Safety Department received daily reports on the employees working remotely. To support them through the transition to a new working environment, we launched an internal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommunications initiative, providing links to free educational platforms, virtual museums, libraries, and language learning sites, and we established special hotlines to address any concerns.\n\nTo protect our staff at these operational sites, we promptly established a number of special sanitary measures. We established a programme of deep-cleaning and disinfecting of our sites and provided all workers with personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves. We upgraded medical rooms and paramedic support and increased the medical monitoring of all our employees. New measures were implemented to balance the need for social distancing with enough staff availability in case of selfisolation or individual employees becoming unwell.\n\nThe Group launched an initiative to support the elderly and retired employees, many of whom are considered high-risk for infection and were therefore unable to leave their homes. The Group delivered free food supplies to 16,000 of these employees in our regions of operation. We set up a dedicated phone line where recipients could arrange purchase and delivery of additional food and medical essentials. To support healthcare and frontline workers in the Irkutsk Region, En+ Group purchased 800,000 medicalgrade masks to donate to hospitals, healthcare institutions and social services.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the Group built and handed over to regional medical organisations seven medical centres in Achinsk, Bratsk, Sayanogorsk, Shelekhov, Krasnoturinsk, Boguchany and Taishet. The construction cost amounted to 4 billion roubles.\n\nIn Kindia, Guinea, RUSAL opened one of the country's first specialist COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment centres. We rapidly converted the Centre for Epidemic and Microbiological Research and Treatment (CEMRT) - which we had built in 2015 to treat and combat the spread of Ebola - into a 60-bed in-patient treatment facility. Following authorisation from the National Agency for Health Security, on 11 April 2020, CEMRT received its first COVID-19 patient. RUSAL commissioned and established a multifunctional centre for the treatment of infectious diseases alongside our medical facility in Friguia, Guinea with all necessary medical equipment, and trained medical staff. We continue to work closely with Guinea's health authorities to support the local communities in Kindia and Friguia. En+ Group is committed to maintaining all initiatives designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic for as long as needed.",

The better the conditions, the lower the outflow of capital and workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RUSAL Territory\n\nRUSAL Territory is a programme for the social and economic development of the regions in which RUSAL operates, providing support for the construction and renovation of communal facilities, the urban environment, and socially significant community spaces. Since its launch in 2011, the programme has supported social and infrastructure projects in 22 cities, towns and villages, and built or renovated hundreds of facilities to provide the local communities with better social infrastructure. In the 10 years since the programme was established, 635 projects have received support and more than 200 social infrastructure facilities were built, repaired or re-equipped. In 2020, the programme's competition resulted in 11 projects being awarded investments of 423.2 million roubles. RUSAL also held an open international competition to create a concept for the development of the Central Park in Krasnoyarsk with a prize fund for 3 winners in the total amount of 6 million roubles.\n\nThe Power segment also started infrastructure projects in the line with its community strategic framework. In 2020, the company constructed a children's playground in Ust-Ilimsk, a hockey stadium in Cheremkhovo, and a ski base in Tulun. It also renewed five hockey rinks in Irkutsk and started the reconstruction of the ski base in Divnogorsk. The Group also initiated a project to create a scaled recreation area along the dam of the Irkutsk HPP. The dam is an arterial city road - public transport runs along it and it is accessible to citizens. Residents use it for running, cycling, walking and sightseeing. The project will create convenient access to the dam, improve the\n\nnetwork of public transport stops, and create new space for both active and peaceful pastimes. The Group conducted an online survey among citizens and created the architectural concept based on public opinion and the city's urban development plans. The first stage of construction works is planned for 2021.\n\nIn Guinea, RUSAL is involved in the construction of basic infrastructure facilities, making a vital difference by providing locals with access to a full range of modern amenities. In 2020, RUSAL commissioned and completed the construction of an elementary school building in Mambia, Kindia Prefecture. At the same time, it built a new indoor market building for the population in Barrage, Kindia Prefecture, and it has successfully constructed a new road bridge across the Samou River in Kindia Prefecture. Another project focused on providing local people with access to drinking water and in 2020, seven new water wells were drilled in various locations in the Kindia and Bok\u00e9 regions where RUSAL operates.\n\n## Volunteering\n\nCorporate volunteering is important to ensure the Group remains engaged with employees and local communities and establishes sustainable relations with both citizens and the government. Our volunteering programmes bring together a wide variety of people, including production facility employees, school children, students, and representatives from social and educational institutions. To maximise social impact, we have developed programmes and technology that make it easier for local residents to volunteer.\n\nIn 2020, due to lockdown in all regions of our operations in Russia, we launched a large-scale social campaign, which became the main activity for hundreds of corporate volunteers from the Group. From March to June, employees were involved in the delivery of food supplies to elderly and retired employees considered high-risk for infection and unable to leave their homes. The ban on holding public events also changed our plans for the implementation of volunteer programmes. The usual events were replaced by prompt assistance to socially vulnerable groups during the pandemic. In general, the number of events has not decreased over the year, but the format has changed quite dramatically, with many events switched to online mode.\n\nThe large social programme of the Metals segment 'Helping is Easy' - launched in 2014 to encourage volunteering; this programme includes annual environmental projects, the Yenisei Day and Green Wave projects, and the online charity game 'Time to Help'. In 2020 our total funding of winners within the frameworks of 'Helpin is Easy' project competition was 2.8 million roubles, and the winners raised additional 1.5 million roubles of co-funding from their organisations and partners. In May 2020, volunteers from RUSAL congratulated 94 veterans of World War II on the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory.",

In 2020, Achinsk, Bratsk, Volgograd, KamenskUralsky, Krasnoturyinsk, Krasnoyarsk, Novokuznetsk, Sayanogorsk and Severouralsk joined the 'River Day'. In two hours, the action teams collected 1,400 bags (11 tonnes) of waste. Once sorted, 360 bags of plastic, glass and metal were sent for recycling.\n\nIn the Metals segment, large-scale charitable event 'From Siberia With Love', aimed at developing a culture of charity and raising private donations, attracted more than 4,000 participants and spectators from Krasnoyarsk and Achinsk.\n\n## Sports and healthy living\n\nEn+ Group supports programmes to ensure healthy living and promote the well-being of local people. One of our largest sports and healthy lifestyle projects in Russia is 'Get on Your Skis Everyone!', runs since 2016 as a partnership between En+ Group, RUSAL, and the Russian Ski Racing Federation. We have built partnerships with regional sports authorities and ski racing federations, and improved the quality of ski infrastructure by upgrading ski resorts, stadiums and other facilities. In 2020, a ski base was built in Tulun, as part of the rehabilitation of the social infrastructure of the city, which suffered from severe floods in the summer of 2019. The Company also provided the necessary sports equipment. Total investments in this project comprised about 14.5 million rubles. New project for construction works of the ski base in Divnogorsk also started in 2020. En + Group and RUSAL conducted the second 'Best Ski Coach of the Year' competition, through which five trainers won scholarships. To popularise and promote skiing to a mass audience, the project has social networks on Instagram, VKontakte, Facebook and YouTube, and publishes unique content for crosscountry skiing enthusiasts of all ages with the involvement of leading Russian skiers.\n\nAnother area of focus is the improvement of healthcare in vulnerable communities. We believe that healthy communities encourage strong development and perform better in all aspects of life. RUSAL has for a long time continued to support the Guinean healthcare\n\n## Project 360 campaign\n\nThe 360 project is part of En+ Group's comprehensive programme to protect Lake Baikal and the nature areas of the Russian Federation from adverse environmental impacts. The programme has been in place since 2011 and includes environmental, scientific, educational and awareness-raising projects. As part of the 360 project, in 2020 we launched an online eco-marathon, which attracted 905 people from all over Russia. In 2020, more than 900 volunteers and employees from Irkutsk, Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, Divnogorsk, Miass and Nizhny Novgorod took part in the 360 project's regular campaigns to clean up the banks of local water bodies.\n\nsystem. All of RUSAL's enterprises in Guinea have their own medical services. This includes four dispensaries, and a hospital with round-the-clock care teams that examine workers before their shifts and provide emergency medical care. Our patients receive consultations and treatment on a regular basis, and children are vaccinated against infectious diseases. We provide medical staff with high-level training and hold health education events for workers.\n\nIn July 2020, RUSAL chartered a plane stocked with humanitarian aid medical cargo to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to Guinea. The cargo included dozens of items of medicines well as modern medical equipment and supplies for the treatment of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\n## Supporting community environmental programmes\n\nEnvironmental safety continues to be a vital area of En+ Group's sustainability strategy. We carry out a series of projects aimed at protecting unique landscapes in the territories where we operate. Our initiatives have received positive responses from regional and federal governments, as well as from residents who appreciate local nature. Through environmental social projects, the Group seeks to cooperate with local organisations to facilitate a synergetic effect. A key environmental programme for the Group is 'Nature Matters', which brings together a variety of activities to promote the protection of Lake Baikal and other water bodies and natural territories, including volunteering, environmental protection events, and eco-education based on collaborations with non-profit organisations and local activists.\n\nIn 2020, En+ Group launched an annual fund to invest in new projects to protect Lake Baikal and other water bodies in Siberia. The fund is delivered through our Environmental",

The contest invites applications from NGOs, academics and community groups and provides support for environmental and social entrepreneurship, environmental educational programmes, volunteer projects, projects to improve infrastructure to reduce anthropogenic pressure on natural areas, and scientific research.\n\nIn the first year of our Environmental Project Grant Contest, we received 83 applications. Fourteen projects from Irkutsk, Ust-Ilimsk, Divnogorsk and cities along the shores of Lake Baikal won the competition and received funding.\n\n## Education\n\nEn+ Group carries out various activities to widen educational opportunities for residents in our regions of operation. Activities include support for schools and universities, the organisation of public exhibitions and events, and the introduction of its own programmes.\n\nIn Russia, En+ Group supports the development of robotics to provide targeted training for young people considering a career in engineering by encouraging the development of key skills for the future, immersing participants in real business environments, and identifying priority areas for regional development. In early 2020, we ran RoboSib-2020 which was the largest event yet. Around 800 students from five regions of Russia and China participated, with a total of more than 5,000 attendees. Of the 164 teams of schoolchildren and students participating in the competition, 76 won RoboSib awards. The winners included teams from the Irkutsk Region, Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Republic of Buryatia, Saint Petersburg, and China.\n\n## Partnership with the Great Baikal Trail (BBT) Association\n\nThrough its partnership with the BBT Association, an organisation focused on environmental education and sustainable development, En+ Group supports responsible eco-tourism in the region, creating safe tourist trails and reducing the impact of human activity on the fragile Baikal ecosystem.\n\nIn 2020, we collaborated with BBT Association and invested 4 million roubles to create a navigation system and improve a popular 54 km-long tourist route in the Pribaikalsky National Park.\n\nIn 2020, the Group started the development of an educational course for schoolchildren - 'Energy in every drop' - to support their learning of the principles of hydroelectric power plant operations. The course is scheduled to launch at schools in 2021.\n\nThe training and development programme of the Metals segment - 'Leaders of Urban Change' - provides courses in the field of social and business design, corporate volunteering, and urban environment development, as well as holding inter-regional gatherings of leaders.\n\nIn Ireland, AAL participates in an industry-led initiative called Limerick for Engineering. The primary goal of the initiative is to increase the quality and quantity of engineering talent in the region by encouraging primary and post-primary students to explore the world of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) while also promoting engineering as a career choice. In 2020, AAL participated in the virtual Limerick for Engineering Showcase, which gave students the opportunity to meet with industry professionals who provided information about their chosen fields and demonstrated some of the interesting technology they work with. Our representatives also visited local schools and gave talks and demonstrations about engineering and RUSAL Aughinish. In addition, a number of students from local schools and universities visited the plant, where they learnt about the alumina production process.\n\nIn Sweden, Kubikenborg Aluminium AB (KUBAL) also pays significant attention to the local educational sphere, participating twice a year in student fairs, establishing a scholarship for students at Sundsvall University, and inviting students from Sundsvall University to conduct research for their thesis at the facility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project implementation was supported by the Federal Target Programme until 2019, and is currently supported by the Russian Scientific Foundation. In 2020, the research provided the following results:\n\n- 1. Two patents describing methods for producing films of a perovskite-like structure were successfully registered in seven foreign territories, including the United States and the European Union. One more patent is to be registered in early 2021\n- 2. Two more R&D results were recommended for registration with the patent authorities of the Russian Federation to ensure legal protection\n- 3. In June 2020, JSC Krasnoyarsk HPP and Moscow State University signed a new master agreement for scientific and technical cooperation with a view to developing perovskite-silicon solar tandems\n\nThrough our sustainable development strategy, En+ Group consistently explores the impact of water use modes on the environment and looks for opportunities to reduce this impact.\n\nThe first stage of research within the 'Long-Term Forecasting of Inflow to Lake Baikal Using Machine Learning Hydrological Modelling Methods' project was completed in 2020. It included an analysis of atmospheric circulation regularity amidst physical and geographical conditions, and an analysis of the past and present correlations between meteorological values and circulation components. It also predicted temperature and precipitation anomalies in the future using machine learning methods with artificial supplementation of the learning sampling. As part of the project:\n\n- -A database of water consumption observations at 12 hydrological posts in the basin of Lake Baikal for 1971-2016 was created and verified\n- -Databases of meteorological parameter observations at the network of weather stations (63 stations) in the basin of Lake Baikal were created using open access databases (Pik, Aisori, GSOD, rp5) and data of VNIIGMI for 1960-2018\n- -A hydrological model of the inflow was formulated to best describe the regional processes. A model of the water inflow to Lake Baikal was calibrated and set up based on the SWAT modelling software\n\nFor the first time, a physical and mathematical model of the discharge generation was developed for the entire basin of Lake Baikal. A model of such class was previously developed solely for the basin of the Selenga River, based on the ECOMAG modelling software, as part of a scientific project of the Institute of Water of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moreido & Kalugin, 2017). Comparing the reproduction quality of daily water consumptions in the Selenga River near the Mostovoy station showed a similar quality of the models for the calibration period, and a much better quality than the model developed for the control and verification period.\n\nThe developed hydrological model of Lake Baikal will be used to create a software solution for scenario calculations of the impact of weather and climate conditions on the inflow to Lake Baikal and will enable scenario calculations of long-term regulation (series of dry years, wet years, cold and warm years, long-term climate trend in accordance with IPCC scenarios, etc.).",

The IAD assists the A&RC and the Board in overseeing the financial and economic activities of the Group and the related systems of internal control and risk management.\n\nThe IAD reports regularly to the A&RC concerning the results of both scheduled and unscheduled audits; any deficiencies identified in the system of internal control; recommendations and corrective measures to be taken by management; identified risks and related financial exposures and mitigation measures.\n\n## Internal control system (ICS)\n\nThe IAD seeks to provide assurance to management and shareholders of the Company that the Group's assets are safeguarded and profits are maximised; that the Company complies with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations; and that proper accounting records are maintained.\n\nThe IAD seeks to ensure that an effective system of internal control is in place and operating effectively across the Group, including:\n\n## 1. Operational and financial control:\n\n- -Conducting audits of the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes across the operating companies in order to identify and minimise risks associated with ineffective management, and to enhance control of operational and technological processes, commercial activities, personnel management, implementation of investment projects, financing, etc.\n- -Conducting audits to prevent and identify fraudulent activities by management, employees and third-party contractors (such as fraud, misappropriation, misuse of the Group's assets, sub-optimal use of materials and time), and mitigate the effects thereof.\n- -Exercising control over commercial activities (including the selection of suppliers of raw materials, other materials, and services, including construction and/or installation works) in the interests of effective cost management for the Group (including by participating in the Tenders Committee and overseeing the work of Tender committee across the Group's operating companies).\n\nThe operational and financial control objectives are achieved through comprehensive audits and controls inspections conducted by the IAD in accordance with the annual audit plan (approved by the A&RC) using a risk-based approach. In addition, the IAD conducts unscheduled audits as requested by management and provides an independent opinion in the fields and areas requiring immediate decision-making by management. The IAD uses audit findings to develop corrective actions aimed at minimising or eliminating any failures or weaknesses identified by audits, with a view to preventing such breaches in the future. The IAD regularly updates management and the A&RC on its audit and review findings, and on the status and implementation of the recommendations it has provided to management.",

Risk maps provide details of each risk event scenario, estimates of possible risk impact and measures aimed at mitigating the possible negative impact on the activities of operating companies, Businesses and the Company. The risk map of the Company includes a list of all possible risks that may threaten the objectives of the Company in the next calendar year.\n\nRisk status monitoring is undertaken on a quarterly basis to analyse any changes, update the estimates for existing risks and implement measures for controlling identified risks, as well as to search for, identify and estimate the impact of new risks arising during the quarter/year.\n\nThe risk monitoring results are submitted to management, the Chief Executive Officer, A&RC and Board. Responsibility for effective risk management rests with the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Key risk management developments of the Company in 2020:\n\n## 1. 2020 Risk Map development and monitoring on quarterly basis over the year\n\nThe En+ Group's Regulations on Risk Management establish the procedure for the development of Risk Maps by all entities of the Group for the coming year and the quarterly review and update of the developed Risk Maps. The results are provided to the Group's executive management and the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2. Large-scale training on risk-management fundamentals at all En+ Group entities\n\nDuring the period July-October 2020, the Group's conducted large-scale training on the risk management system. The training took place on the Company's Corporate University platform and comprised a video course and tests at the end of the course.\n\nThe training covered 3,300 Group employees. The distance-learning format made it possible to accomplish the task despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, starting 1 July 2020 the En+ Group Risk Management course became mandatory for all new employees upon completion of their probationary period, regardless of their position.\n\nRegular risk management training will allow the Company to increase the culture of risk management and allow all Company employees to apply the tools of a risk-oriented approach.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nAs part of its strategic, business planning and risk processes, the Group considers how a number of macroeconomic themes may influence its principal risks. These are factors about which the Company should be cognisant in developing its strategy, including long-term supply and demand trends. They include, for example, developments in technology, demographics, climate change, and how markets and the regulatory environment may respond. These themes are relevant to the Group's assessments across a number of its principal risks. The Group will continue to monitor these themes and the relevant developing policy environment at an international and national level, and will adapt its strategy accordingly.\n\nSince March 2020, the Company has been monitoring the evolving situation, and consequent emerging risk, with regard to the spread of COVID-19. The Group has been working with a variety of stakeholders, including industry and medical organisations, to ensure its operational response and advice to its workforce is appropriate and commensurate with the prevailing expert advice and level of risk.",

The Code states the key values, principles and standards of business conduct to be adhered to by the employees and Board members; the Code explains matters relating to employees, third parties, customers and governmental authorities; health, safety and environment; efficiency; ensuring confidentiality of information; control and reporting, and conflicts of interest. The Company maintains a whistleblowing hotline for employees and other persons. The Code of Corporate Ethics is publicly available in Russian and English on the Company's corporate website.\n\n## Corporate compliance system\n\nEn+ Group operates an effective corporate compliance system, subject to applicable laws, recommendations issued by regulators, special requirements of the industry and best practices. The Board of Directors has established a Compliance Committee, which ensures the development of and control over the Group's compliance management system.\n\n## Anticorruption compliance and corporate ethics\n\nEn+ Group takes every opportunity to promote best practice in fighting corruption, and consistently complies with high standards of responsible and ethical behaviour. In 2020, the Board of Directors adopted the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest of the Group. These policies provide the basis for continuous improvement of the corporate culture and implementation of the required components of compliance at each and every Group company.\n\n## Sanctions compliance\n\nEn+ Group is focused upon mitigating the risk of being reincluded in the OFAC's SDN list. A relevant compliance programme has been devised and is being continuously developed by the Company. The Board of Directors approved the Sanctions Policy aimed at ensuring that the En+ Group, and its officers, directors and employees comply with the applicable terms of sanctions removal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## To download Code of Corporate Ethics from our website:\n\nwww.enplusgroup.com/upload/iblock/98b/\n\nCode-of-Corporate-Ethics-\\_Eng\\_.pdf\n\n## To download Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy\n\n## from our website:\n\nwww.enplusgroup.com/upload/iblock/f78/Anti\\_Bribery-andCorruption-Policy-\\_Eng\\_.pdf",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nThe Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Group intends to continue to improve in this area and to adhere to internationally recognised standards of corporate governance, transparency, disclosure and accountability applicable to listed companies.\n\nThe Company has made substantial changes to its corporate governance practices, as a result of the OFAC Sanctions imposed on the Company and its subsidiaries on 6 April 2018 and their subsequent removal on 27 January 2019. Following these changes, the Company has proven its commitment to high international standards of corporate governance.\n\nWith effect from 9 July 2019 (the 'Continuance Date'), the Company was registered as an international public joint-stock company in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities of the Russian Federation and changed its legal jurisdiction of incorporation from Jersey to Russia (the 'Continuance'). As a consequence, the Company's memorandum of association and articles of association previously governed by Jersey law were superseded by a new charter (the 'Charter'), and the Company's name was changed to EN+ GROUP IPJSC.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Continuance, the Company's ordinary shares were admitted to the Level One Quotation List of the Moscow Exchange, thereby creating a more diversified platform for investors in the Company's equity securities. The Company's GDRs were delisted from the Moscow Exchange and retained their listing on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nFollowing the Continuance, the Company aims to comply with the recommendations of the Russian Corporate Governance Code insofar as is appropriate and practicable in the Group's context. In its corporate governance practices, the Company is also guided by the Listing Rules of the Moscow Exchange.\n\nAdhering to high standards of corporate governance is an important element in attracting new investment, strengthening the Group's competitive position and enhancing shareholder value. Good governance is based on clarity of roles and responsibilities, and the Company aims to ensure that its governance procedures are applied to all areas of decision-making across the Group.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible to all of En+ Group's stakeholders for the strategic management of the Company. The day-to-day running of the Company falls within the competence of the CEO 1 . However, the Board retains responsibility for the approval of certain matters, which affect the shape and risk profile of the Company (see details below).\n\nThe Company's corporate governance system outlines the relationship between the Company's shareholders, the Board, the CEO and the management team, as well as the remit and duties of the Board committees.\n\nWe consider the following corporate governance principles to be fundamental to our operations:\n\n- -Transparency\n- -Open and clear decision-making\n- -Legal compliance, including clear and robust compliance with requirements for the Company to be and remain clear from the OFAC Sanctions\n- -Ongoing growth of the Company's value for the benefit of all stakeholders\n\nAs a company incorporated in Russia, with GDRs listed on the Official List of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Company is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, the Company has chosen to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code insofar as is appropriate and practicable in the Group's context.",

        "page_content": "## General shareholders meeting\n\nThe general shareholders meeting (the 'GSM') is the supreme governance body of the Company. The Charter details the matters which fall within the powers of the GSM.\n\nVoting at a GSM is conducted on the basis of one vote per ordinary share. Decisions are generally passed by a simple majority of shareholders voting in favour of a motion at the meeting, save for a number of matters which, under the Charter, require the adoption of a special resolution (i.e. voting by a 2/3 majority), including, inter alia:\n\n- -The adoption of amendments to the Charter or approval of the restated Charter\n- -A change in the Company's status to non-public, or obtaining public status\n- -The reorganisation of the Company by way of consolidation, merger in the form of acquisition, division, or divestment\n- -The liquidation of the Company\n- -The fragmentation, conversion or consolidation of Company shares\n- -The acquisition of the Company's outstanding shares\n- -An increase or reduction in the Company's share capital.\n\nThe GSM is quorate if shareholders holding more than half of the votes attached to the outstanding voting shares in the Company participate.\n\nIf the quorum for holding of an annual GSM is not reached, an adjourned GSM with the same agenda shall be reconvened at a later date. If the quorum for an extraordinary GSM is not reached, an adjourned GSM with the same agenda may be reconvened at a later date. An adjourned GSM is quorate if attended by shareholders holding no less than 30 per cent of outstanding voting shares in the Company.\n\nResolutions of the GSM may be adopted either in a meeting held in the form of joint presence of shareholders or by absentee voting.\n\nIf the agenda of a GSM includes issues relating to the election of the Board, approval of the Company's auditor for the audit of accounting (financial) statements prepared under the Russian Accounting Standards ('RAS'), or approval of the annual report and annual accounting (financial) statements of the Company, it may be conducted only with the joint presence of shareholders. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 Russian joint-stock companies were permitted 1 to hold GSMs with the above-mentioned agenda via absentee voting.\n\nAn extraordinary GSM may be held based on a resolution of the Board either adopted on its own initiative, or at the request of a shareholder (or shareholders) holding no less than 10 per cent of voting shares in the Company as at the date of the request. An extraordinary GSM convened at the request of a shareholder (or shareholders) holding at least 10 per cent of voting shares in the Company shall be held within 50 days from the date of the request to convene the extraordinary GSM.\n\nThe Charter envisages a procedure for electronic voting at a GSM. Voting may be carried out in electronic form if this is envisaged by the decision of the Board. In this case ballots may be filled out in electronic form online, or sent to the Company's email address.\n\nInformation (materials) which are to be provided to the GSM should be made available within 20 days prior to the GSM, and in the event of a GSM with an agenda item on the Company's reorganisation, within 30 days prior to the GSM.",

However, these additional matters did not detract from the Committee's focus on ensuring that our systems of risk management and internal control remained effective throughout the year and continuing attention to the Group's financial position and performance during this challenging period.\n\nThis report explains how the Committee has addressed the Group's financial and audit risks in the context of the macroeconomic environment and day-to-day operations, and how we have taken these into account in our oversight of risks, controls, financial performance and debt management.\n\nOur work in 2020 focused on the following areas:\n\n- -Reviewing and challenging management's plans to address the additional risks and financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reviewing and recommending to the Board a revised 2020 Business Plan reflecting the changed operating environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Overseeing the execution of our internal audit and risk management plans, with particular focus being given to cyber security, financial control effectiveness, project management and business planning\n- -Reviewing and challenging key business performance metrics and accounting judgements, particularly as regards the half-year and year-end financial statements and disclosures and\n- -Initiating and overseeing an external audit tender process giving rise to a final recommendation for the appointment of Ernst & Young LLC ('EY') as the Group's external auditor with effect from 2021.\n\nThe external audit tender process was a significant additional activity of the Committee in 2020, undertaken jointly with the audit committee of UC RUSAL and in compliance with the Group's tendering requirements. Based upon the Committee's recommendation to the Board, the Board has approved EY as the Group's external auditor for the audit of IFRS financial statements and, subject to approval by shareholders, EY will also be appointed as the Group's external auditor for the audit of the accounting (financial) statements prepared under RAS, for the year ending 31 December 2021. Therefore, the year ended 31 December 2020 is the final year for the exercise of audit functions by JSC KPMG ('KPMG').\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee's core responsibilities are detailed below in this section of the Annual Report and can also be found on the Company's website (www.enplusgroup.com; under Corporate Governance). These responsibilities include, inter alia , to:\n\n- -Review the content and integrity of the annual and interim financial statements and advise the Board on whether they are fair and balanced, and provide the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy\n- -Review the appropriateness of the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n- -Monitor and review the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control\n- -Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group's IT environment, including cyber security, ensuring that related controls are adequate, reliable and effective\n- -Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit Directorate (the 'IAD')\n- -Oversee the relationship with the external auditor, including fees for audit and non-audit services; and\n- -Identify any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed and make recommendations to the Board as to the steps to be taken.\n\n## Carl Hughes\n\nChair of the Audit & Risk Committee",

The Chief Executive Officer also attends certain meetings as well as other management representatives according to agenda.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee regularly meets with the external audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the Company.\n\nThe Committee monitors its own effectiveness and that of the IAD and the external auditor at least annually. Through the annual review of the Regulations of the Audit & Risk Committee, and regular meetings with the IAD, key management personnel and the external auditor, the Committee has concluded that its core duties in relation to financial reporting, internal controls and risk management systems, whistleblowing and fraud, internal audit, external audit and reporting responsibilities are being performed well.\n\n## Committee meetings during 2020\n\nIn line with the Committee's annual schedule, the Committee met on 5 occasions during 2020. A summary of the main items discussed is set out below:\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n- -Key risks, judgements and uncertainties impacting the half-year and year-end financial statements, including reports from both management and the external auditor\n- -Appropriateness of the going concern assumption\n- -Review of half-year or full-year press release and results statements\n\n## Internal audit, control and risk management\n\n- -Internal audit progress against the 2020 plan, including key findings arising since the Committee's last meeting\n- -Internal audit plan and budget for 2021\n- -Cyber security update\n- -Review of process and controls relating to the development of the Group's internal control framework\n\n## External audit\n\n- -Review of KPMG's plan for the 2020 audit, including key risks and planned approach\n- -Review of external audit fees subject to the audit plan\n- -Level of non-audit services provided by the external auditor\n- -Evaluation of the quality, independence and objectivity of KPMG\n- -Tender of external auditor services and recommending the appointment of EY\n\n## Performance and effectiveness reviews\n\n- -The Committee and its governing Regulations\n- -IAD\n- -External audit firm\n\n## Financial reporting and significant financial statement reporting issues\n\nOne of the Committee's primary roles in relation to financial reporting is to assess, amongst other things:\n\n- -The appropriateness of the accounting policies selected and disclosures made, including whether they comply with IFRS; and\n- -Those judgements, estimates and key assumptions that could have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance and position, or on the remuneration of executive and senior management.\n\nThe Committee considers these items together with both management and our external auditor, who each provide reports to the Committee in respect of these areas. The main areas considered during 2020 included:\n\n- -Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the Group's operations and financial performance\n- -Accounting for the Group's interest in Norilsk Nickel\n- -Property, plant and equipment, including valuation of Group's hydro assets, impairment testing and related assumptions",

The Committee and the Board are satisfied that the Annual Report meets this requirement, with appropriate weight being given to both positive and negative developments in the year, as a result of a robust preparatory process, including:\n\n- -Clear guidance and instructions provided to all contributors\n- -Revisions to regulatory requirements communicated and monitored\n- -A thorough process of review, evaluation and verification of the content of the Annual Report and Accounts to ensure accuracy and consistency\n- -External advisors, including the external auditor, providing advice to management and the Committee on best practice with regard to the creation of the Annual Report and Accounts; and\n- -A Committee meeting was held in April 2021 to review and approve the draft 2020 Annual Report in advance of the sign-off by the Board.\n\n## External audit\n\nOne of the A&RC's principal responsibilities is to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of the Group's external auditor.\n\nKPMG has been the external auditor to the Company since 2009. Until June 2020, the lead audit partner for the Group was Yerkozha Akylbek; he was succeeded by Andrei Ryazantsev.\n\nAs part of the annual external audit review, the A&RC considers the fee proposals and, in the context of the relevant professional and regulatory requirements, the effectiveness of the external audit process in determining whether to recommend the reappointment of the external auditor. The effectiveness of KPMG was formally evaluated by the Committee during the year and it was concluded that the Committee continued to be satisfied with KPMG's performance and the firm's objectivity and independence.\n\nGiven the longevity of KPMG's tenure as the Group's external auditor, the Committee initiated and oversaw a formal tender of the Group's external audit services during the year, jointly with the audit committee of RUSAL, in compliance with the Group's tendering requirements. As a consequence of this process the Committee recommended to the Board that EY be appointed as the Group's external auditor with effect from 2021. The lead group audit partner from EY will be Mikhail Khachaturian. The Board has appointed EY as the Company's auditor for the audit of the IFRS financial statements. The appointment of EY with respect to the audit of accounting (financial) statements prepared under RAS is subject to shareholder approval at the Company's annual GSM in 2021.\n\nA transition plan and process has been agreed by KPMG and EY with management and the A&RC to ensure the smooth transition of external audit responsibilities during 2021.\n\nThe Committee believes that the external auditor's independence and objectivity can potentially be affected by the level of non-audit services provided to the Company. However, the Committee acknowledges that certain work of a non-audit nature is best undertaken by the external auditor.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, the total fees for audit and non-audit services provided by the Group's external auditor, KPMG, are set out below:\n\n|                                     |   USD mn | %    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|------|\n| Total audit services                |      6.7 | 85%  |\n| Total non-audit services            |      1.2 | 15%  |\n| Total fees paid to the audit firm 1 |      7.9 | 100% |",

With more than thirty years' experience in the area, and as Chairman of the Compliance Committee, this is something I take extremely seriously. I am very proud of the progress En+ has made over the last two years in corporate governance. In all areas the Company is led by a set of fundamental principles: we are committed to transparency, legal compliance and to clear and open decision-making. Furthermore, we are focused on value creation for the benefit of all shareholders and stakeholders and ensure everything we do reflects our responsibility to protect the environment and safeguard the health and wellbeing of our employees.\n\nIn 2020, we enhanced our high standards further through new corporate policies focused on, among other things, our code of ethics, conflicts of interest, anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn important part of the Board of Directors' remit is continued compliance with the terms of sanctions removal agreed with OFAC. OFAC described the measures undertaken by the Company as delivering 'unprecedented transparency'-a standard to which we remain fully committed. We are in regular dialogue with OFAC and uphold a continuous process of regular extensive audits and monthly certification.\n\nAdherence to the terms of sanctions removal is just part of our comprehensive compliance regimen. As is expected for a group of our size, complexity and international presence, this regimen covers every aspect of our business. It is supported through an independent compliance function which reports directly to the Board and the Compliance Committee.\n\nEn+ is committed to setting the standard of global governance, as we continuously seek to attract investment,\n\nThe primary responsibilities of the CC are, inter alia, the following:\n\n- -Ensuring the formation of a compliance management system within the Group\n- -Taking part in the development of policies and other internal regulations of the Company relating to matters of compliance, and consistently following up on their observance\n- -Ensuring that adequate compliance control is in place in the Group\n- -Conducting due diligence in the event of any reasonable doubt regarding observance of compliance requirements and the provisions of compliance documents.\n\nThe \u0421\u0421 reviews its own performance and reassesses the adequacy of procedures and guidelines in respect of regulatory compliance.\n\nIn 2020, the CC held five meetings and considered regular compliance reports and goals for 2021.\n\nstrengthen our competitive position and enhance shareholder value.\n\n## Christopher Burnham\n\nChair of the Compliance Committee\n\n## Composition\n\nThe CC was established following the removal of the Company from OFAC's SDN list.

As well as reinforcing management efforts to strengthen health and safety performance, the HSE Committee reviewed environmental risks at its facilities in the wake of the diesel spill at Norilsk Nickel, given that warming temperatures appear to have been a factor. The Committee were satisfied that all risks were being closely monitored and necessary actions were in place to address them. The Committee also oversaw the evolution of a unified environmental strategy for the Group, which is fundamental to our success as a business and to our leading role in delivering a sustainable future.\n\nWe deeply regret that there were four fatal accidents involving En+ Group employees during the year. We have comprehensively reviewed each accident to determine critical factors and root causes, and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken to prevent similar incidents occurring again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile our lost time injury frequency rate decreased for the Metals segment, it increased overall in 2020 owing to an accident involving a bus carrying our employees in Ust-Ilimsk. Fortunately, all those involved are safe. Preventative measures have been implemented.\n\nWe have clear HSE policies and management systems at all facilities, with results and performance indicators discussed at monthly top management meetings and training regularly reviewed to ensure employees are fully equipped to operate safely. The HSE Committee keeps a close watch on performance and supports management efforts to embed a strong health and safety culture throughout our operations.\n\nThis year we have strengthened our position as an environmental leader and have continued to drive progress towards greater emissions transparency for aluminium.\n\nAs a Group, we were among the first aluminium producers to commit to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway by 2050. In January 2021, we announced the aluminium industry's most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets: a 35% decrease by 2030 (compared with 2018 levels) for Scope 1&2 emissions and a pledge to be net zero by 2050. To ensure our strategy for achieving these goals is robust, and reflects the diverse interests of our stakeholders, we are undertaking in-depth consultations. The newly created En+ Climate Change Taskforce led by our Chief Operating Officer and reporting to the Executive Chairman will help drive the transformative change required by the business. We intend to outline our net zero pathway in September 2021.\n\n## Joan MacNaughton\n\nChair of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee",

This is in particular related to such cash generating units (CGUs) as aluminium and alumina plants, bauxite mines, coal mines, Irkutsk GridCo and CHP.\n\nAs at the reporting date management performs valuation of the recoverable amount of the Group's assets and cash generating units as their value in use.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key judgmental areas that our audit is concentrated on.\n\nFor aluminium, alumina, bauxite, coal, Irkutsk GridCo and CHP CGUs we evaluated the reasonableness of the expected cash flow forecasts by comparing them with the latest budgets approved by the Board of Directors, externally derived data as well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as production levels, forecasted aluminium sales prices, forecasted coal sales prices, forecasted volumes and tariffs of electricity transmission and electricity and heat sales, forecasted alumina and bauxite purchase prices, costs inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We also considered the historic accuracy of management's forecasts by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results.\n\nWe used our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodology used by the Group.\n\nIn particular, we challenged:\n\n- - aluminium and alumina smelters, bauxite mines costs projections by comparing them with historical results and industry peers;\n- - coal prices, tariffs for electricity transmission and electricity and heat sales by comparing them with historical data, economic and industry forecasts;\n- - volumes of electricity transmission by comparing them with historical volumes and potential Taishet aluminium smelter demand;\n- - the key assumptions for long term revenue and costs growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them with historical results, economic and industry forecasts; and\n- - the discount rates used. Specifically, we recalculated the Group's weighted average cost of capital using market comparable information.\n\nWe also performed sensitivity analysis on the discounted cash flow forecasts and assessed whether the Group's disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Revaluation of hydro assets\n\nPlease refer to the Note 11(e) in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group has a significant class of assets which is material to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2020 and is measured under revaluation model.\n\nChanges in macroeconomic environment including, but not limited to discount rates and inflation, as well as a two year period from last revaluation may indicate that as at 31 December 2020 carrying amount of hydro assets could be different from their fair value.\n\nAs at the reporting date management performed a revaluation of hydro assets involving independent valuer.\n\nDue to the significant judgement required to determine depreciated replacement costs ('DRC') as well as inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows used to test DRC for economic obsolescence, this is one of the key judgmental areas that our audit is concentrated on.\n\nWe evaluated competence, capabilities and objectivity of the independent valuer used by the Group.\n\nWe used our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodology used by the Group.\n\nIn particular, we challenged:\n\n- - methodology used for different types of assets;\n- - key assumptions including costs to reproduce or replace property, plant and equipment, adjustments for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence;\n- - reliability and appropriateness of market data sources used by independent valuer;\n- - volumes of electricity sales and tariffs as well as costs projections by comparing them with historical data, approved budgets and economic and industry forecasts;\n- - the key assumptions for long term revenue growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them with historical results, economic and industry forecasts; and\n- - the discount rates used.\n\nWe also assessed whether the Group's disclosures about the revaluation of hydro assets are adequate.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's Annual Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The Group's Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- - Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

Background\n\n## (a) Organisation\n\nEN+ GROUP IPJSC (the 'Parent Company') was established as a limited liability company according to the legislation of the British Virgin Islands on 30 April 2002 under the name of Baufinanz Limited. On 18 March 2004, the Parent Company registered a change of its legal name to Eagle Capital Group Limited. On 25 August 2005, the Parent Company changed its domicile to Jersey and was renamed to En+ Group Limited. On 1 June 2017, the Parent Company changed its status to a public company and was renamed to EN+ GROUP PLC. On 9 July 2019, the Parent Company changed its domicile to the Russian Federation with a registration as EN+ GROUP International public joint-stock company (EN+GROUP IPJSC). As at 31 December 2020, the Parent Company's registered office is Oktyabrskaya st. 8, office 34, Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Region, 236006, Russian Federation.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, the Parent Company successfully completed an initial public offering of global depositary receipts on the London Stock Exchange and the Moscow Exchange. On 17 February 2020, the Parent Company's ordinary shares were included into the 'Level 1' part of the list of securities admitted to trading on Moscow Exchange. On 20 April 2020, Company's GDRs were delisted from the Moscow Exchange.\n\nEN+ GROUP IPJSC is the parent company for a vertically integrated aluminium and power group, engaged in aluminium production and energy generation (together with the Parent Company referred to as 'the Group').\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, Mr. Oleg Deripaska beneficially controls and exercises voting rights in respect of 35% of the voting shares of the Company and his direct or indirect shareholding cannot exceed 44.95% of the shares of the Company.\n\nThe other significant holders as at 31 December 2020 were as follows:\n\n|                                | Shareholding   | Voting rights   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Parent Company's subsidiary    | 21.37%         | 7.04%           |\n| Citi (Nominees), including     | 14.10%         | 14.10%          |\n| Glencore Group Funding Limited | 10.55%         | 10.55%          |\n| Other shareholders             | 19.58%         | 6.18%           |\n| Independent trustees           | -              | 37.68%          |\n\nGlencore Group Funding Limited is a subsidiary of Glencore Plc.\n\nRelated party transactions are detailed in note 23.\n\nIn February 2020, the Group acquired 21.37% of its shares from VTB for cash at a price of USD 11.57 per share. The voting rights in respect of acquired shares representing 14.33% of Parent Company's issued share capital are retained with independent trustees. Votes attaching to the remaining 7.04% of shares are voted by the Chairman of the Parent Company's Board at the Board's direction.\n\nBased on the information at the Group's disposal at the reporting date, there is no individual that has an indirect prevailing ownership interest in the Parent Company exceeding 50%, who could exercise voting rights in respect of more than 35% of the Parent Company's issued share capital or has an opportunity to exercise control over the Parent Company.",

        "page_content": "## (b) Operations\n\nThe Group is a leading vertically integrated aluminium and power producer, which combines the assets and results of its Metals and Power segments.\n\nThe Metals segment operates in the aluminium industry primarily in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Guinea, Jamaica, Ireland, Italy and Sweden and is principally engaged in the mining and refining of bauxite and nepheline ore into alumina, the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina and the fabrication of aluminium and aluminium alloys into semi-fabricated and finished products.\n\nThe Power segment engages in all major areas of the power industry, including electric power generation, power trading and supply. It also includes supporting operations engaged in the supply of coal resources to the Group. The Group's principal power plants are located in East Siberia and Volga Region, the Russian Federation.\n\n## (c) Business environment in emerging economies\n\nThe Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica and Guinea have been experiencing political and economic changes that have affected, and may continue to affect, the activities of enterprises operating in these environments. Consequently, operations in these countries involve risks that typically do not exist in other markets, including reconsideration of privatisation terms in certain countries where the Group operates following changes in governing political powers.\n\nStarting in 2014, the United States of America, the European Union and some other countries have imposed and gradually expanded economic sanctions against a number of Russian individuals and legal entities. The imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty, including more volatile equity markets, a depreciation of the Russian rouble, a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit. As a result, some Russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations. The longer-term effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has further increased uncertainty in the business environment (note 1(e)).\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect management's assessment of the impact of the Russian, Ukrainian, Jamaican and Guinean business environments on the operations and the financial position of the Group. The future business environment may differ from management's assessment.\n\n## (d) OFAC sanctions\n\nOn 6 April 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ('OFAC') designated, amongst others, the Parent Company, JSC EuroSibEnergo ('EuroSibEnergo') and UC RUSAL Plc (from 25 September 2020 UC RUSAL IPJSC, 'UC RUSAL',) as Specially Designated Nationals ('SDN') (the 'OFAC Sanctions').\n\nAs a result, all property or interests in property of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries located in the United States or in the possession of U.S. Persons were blocked, frozen, and could not have been transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in. Several general licenses were issued at the time of the designation and subsequently certain transactions were authorised with the Parent Company, EuroSibEnergo and UC RUSAL, and with their respective debt and equity.\n\nOn 27 January 2019, OFAC announced the removal of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, including UC RUSAL and EuroSibEnergo, from OFAC's SDN list and Blocked Persons with immediate effect. The removal was subject to and conditional upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, but not limited to:\n\n- - ending Mr Oleg Deripaska's control of the Group, through the reduction of his direct and indirect ownership interest in the Parent Company to below 50%;\n- - establishing independent voting arrangements for the Parent Company's shares held by certain shareholders;\n- - corporate governance changes, including, inter alia, overhauling the composition of the EN+ Board to ensure that independent directors constitute the majority of the Board, and ongoing reporting and certifications by the Parent Company and UC RUSAL to OFAC concerning compliance with the conditions for sanctions' removal.",

        "page_content": "## (e) COVID-19\n\nThe first months of 2020 have seen significant global market turmoil triggered by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Along with other factors, including a sharp decrease in the price of oil, this has resulted in high volatility on the stock market, with a considerable drop of indices, as well as a depreciation of the Russian rouble. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the first half of 2020, aluminium prices deteriorated. These factors had an adverse impact on the revenue and profitability of the Group during second and third quarter of 2020, partially offset by rouble depreciation, decreases in costs of raw materials linked to the oil price, and relatively stable electricity consumption in Siberia region. During that period, considering depressed level of aluminium prices, management is implementing a number of measures including, but not limited to, cost and working capital optimization. By the start of December 2020, aluminium prices mostly recovered back to the pre-COVID and pre-sanctions level which was also supported by the recovery of global aluminium demand and production. The current consensus is that forecast aluminium prices will continue to remain at a slightly depressed level compared to the spot price as of early December 2020 with subsequent recovery in the long-term. The global demand and production of aluminium is also expected to demonstrate positive trends but may be affected by further COVID-19 developments. At the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Group continues to assess the impact of the above factors on its financial position and future cash flows and thoroughly monitors all developments. Considering the current Group cash flows forecasts, management has concluded that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in operation and be able to meet their obligations as they fall due. To mitigate the risks of potential COVID-19 developments on the Group's operations management has implemented and continues to maintain a number of measures including those related to production and supply processes continuity, staff safety and support of local medical infrastructure in areas where the Group operates.\n\n## 2. Basis of preparation\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs'), which collective term includes all International Accounting Standards and related interpretations promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\n\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements is also regulated by Russian Federal Law 208-FZ dated 27 July 2010 'On consolidated financial statements' in all aspects, except for language and functional and presentation currencies, which are regulated by Russian Federal Law 290-FZ dated 3 August 2018 'On international companies and international funds'.\n\nThe following amended standards and interpretations are effective from 1 January 2020 but did not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements:\n\n- - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards;\n- - Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8);\n- - Extension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4);\n- - Interest Rate Benchmarking Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7).\n\nThe Group applied Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3) to business combinations whose acquisition dates are on or after 1 January 2020 in assessing whether it had acquired a business or a group of assets. The details of accounting policies and details of the Group's acquisition of subsidiary during the year ended 31 December 2020 are set out in notes 12 and 15(e).\n\nA number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n\n- - Onerous contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37);\n- - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16);\n- - COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16);\n- - Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16);\n- - Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3);\n- - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1);\n- - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28);\n- - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.",

        "page_content": "The above new standards, except for IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (b) Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis except as set out in the significant accounting policies in notes 11, 15(e) and 19.\n\n## (c) Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe Parent Company's functional currency is the United States Dollar ('USD') as it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Parent Company. The functional currencies of the Group's significant subsidiaries are the currencies of the primary economic environment and key business processes of these subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Roubles ('RUB'), Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros ('EUR'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise stated herein.\n\n## (d) Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported revenue and costs during the relevant period.\n\nManagement bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 25.\n\n## (e) Consolidation of OJSC Irkutsk Electric Grid Company ('Irkutsk GridCo')\n\nIn December 2009, the Group sold to third parties under share purchase contracts all the shares in two Cypriot companies of the Group controlling 34.16% of the shares in Irkutsk GridCo; subsequently the Group purchased 19.9% of the shares in Irkutsk GridCo. The arrangements attached to the share purchase contracts enable the Group to retain certain rights with respect to the disposed shares and the sale did not result in deconsolidation. As at 31 December 2020, the effective interest in Irkutsk GridCo held by the Group is 52.4% (31 December 2019: 52.4%).\n\nAs laws and regulations in the electricity sector in Russia are continuing to develop there is uncertainty with respect to the legal interpretation of the existing arrangements which enables the Group to control Irkutsk GridCo and, consequently, these may be interpreted by the Russian regulatory authorities as noncompliant with applicable legislation upon enforcement. Management believes that such arrangements are compliant with the legislation and therefore the Group has the ability to control Irkutsk GridCo as described above. Should the arrangements be found non-compliant upon their enforcement, the Group may be required to unwind the arrangements subsequent to their enforcement and sell Irkutsk GridCo to a third party at that time.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Significant accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies are described in the related notes to the consolidated financial statements captions and in this note.\n\nThe accounting policies and judgements applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## (a) Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable to interests that are not owned by the Group, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from equity attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as an allocation of the total profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the year between non-controlling interests and the equity shareholders of the Group.\n\nLosses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, whereby adjustments are made to the amounts of controlling and non-controlling-interests within consolidated equity to reflect the change in relative interests, but no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in that former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset (refer to note 15) or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture (refer to note 13).\n\n## (ii) Acquisitions of non-controlling interests\n\nThe acquisition of an additional non-controlling interest in an existing subsidiary after control has been obtained is accounted for as an equity transaction with any difference between the cost of the additional investment and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the date of exchange recognised directly in equity.\n\nThe issue of a put option (a mandatory offer) to acquire a non-controlling interest in subsidiary, after control has been obtained and accounted for by the Group as an equity transaction, results in the recognition of a liability for the present value of the expected exercise price and the derecognition of non-controlling interests within consolidated equity. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in the carrying amount of the put liability are recognised within equity. If the put option expires unexercised then the put liability is derecognised and noncontrolling interests are recognised.",

        "page_content": "For a written put or forward option with the non-controlling shareholders in an existing subsidiary on their equity interest in that subsidiary, if the non-controlling shareholders do not have present access to the returns associated with the underlying ownership interest, the contract is accounted for as an anticipated acquisition of the underlying non-controlling interests, as if the put option had been exercised already or the forward had been satisfied by the non-controlling shareholders.\n\n## (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## (b) Foreign currencies\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency are measured based on historical cost and are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective, which is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated from their functional currencies to USD at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to USD at exchange rates approximating exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the currency translation reserve in equity. For the purposes of foreign currency translation, the net investment in a foreign operation includes foreign currency intra-group balances for which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and foreign currency differences arising from such a monetary item are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.",

Segment reporting\n\n## (a) Reportable segments\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group's key executive management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete consolidated financial statements are available.\n\nIndividually material operating segments are not aggregated for financial reporting purposes unless the segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in respect of the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, the type or class of customers, the methods used to distribute the products or provide the services and the nature of the regulatory environment. Operating segments which are not individually material may be aggregated if they share a majority of these criteria.\n\nBased on the current management structure and internal reporting the Group has identified two operating segments: (a)  Metals. The Metals segment comprises UC RUSAL with disclosures being based on the public financial statements of UC RUSAL. All adjustments made to UC RUSAL, including any adjustments arising from different timing of IFRS first time adoption, are included in 'Adjustments' column. The Power assets of UC RUSAL are included within the Metals segment.\n\n- (b) Power. The Power segment mainly comprises the power assets, as described in note 1(b).\n\nThese business units are managed separately and the results of their operations are reviewed by the key executive management personnel and Board of Directors on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2019, the Board of Directors has commissioned a full review of strategic options with respect to the Irkutsk-region coal and coal-fired power assets as part of the Group's commitment to minimising its carbon footprint. At the date of these consolidated financial statements the Group has completed the spin-off of the Irkutsk region coal-fired heat business unit into an 100% Irkutskenergo subsidiary owned as the first step.\n\n## (b) Segment results, assets and liabilities\n\nFor the purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources between segments, the Group's senior executive management monitor the results, assets and liabilities and cash flows attributable to each reportable segment on the following bases:\n\n- - Total segment assets include all tangible, intangible assets and current assets.\n- - Total segment liabilities include all current and non-current liabilities.\n- - Revenue and expenses are allocated to the reportable segments with reference to sales generated by those segments and the expenses incurred by those segments or which otherwise arise from the depreciation or amortisation of assets attributable to those segments.\n- - The measure used for reporting segment results is the net profit and Adjusted EBITDA (key non-IFRS financial measure used by the Group as reference for assessing operating effectiveness). Segment profit or loss and Adjusted EBITDA are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n- - Adjusted EBITDA for any period represents the results from operating activities adjusted for amortisation and depreciation, impairment charges and gain/(losses) on disposal of property, plant and equipment for the relevant period.\n\nIn addition to receiving segment information concerning segment results, management is provided with segment information concerning revenue (including inter-segment revenue), the carrying value of investments and share of profits/(losses) of associates and joint ventures, depreciation, amortisation, interest income and expenses, other finance income and costs, income tax, gains/(losses) on disposal of property, plant and equipment, impairment of non-current assets and additions of non-current segment assets used by the segments in their operations. Intersegment pricing is determined primarily on a consistent basis using market benchmarks.",

In the CIS, production facilities operate in Russia and Ukraine. In Europe, production facilities are located in Italy, Ireland and Sweden. African production facilities are represented by the bauxite mines and an alumina refinery in Guinea. In the Americas the Group operates one production facility in Jamaica, one in Guyana and a trading subsidiary in the United States of America.\n\nThe following table sets out information about the geographical location of the Group's revenue from external customers and the Group's property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, interests in associates and joint ventures and goodwill ('specified non-current assets'). The geographical location of customers is based on the location at which the services were provided or the goods delivered. The geographical location of the specified non-current assets is based on the physical location of the asset. Unallocated specified non-current assets comprise mainly goodwill and interests in associates and joint ventures.\n\n|                                 | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Revenue from external customers | 2020  USD million        | 2019  USD million        |\n| Russia                          | 3,873                    | 4,235                    |\n| Turkey                          | 956                      | 1,052                    |\n| Netherlands                     | 727                      | 985                      |\n| China                           | 615                      | 119                      |\n| USA                             | 471                      | 652                      |\n| Japan                           | 471                      | 440                      |\n| South Korea                     | 329                      | 577                      |\n| Poland                          | 338                      | 457                      |\n| Greece                          | 236                      | 188                      |\n| Italy                           | 228                      | 573                      |\n| Germany                         | 211                      | 235                      |\n| Taiwan                          | 185                      | 53                       |\n| France                          | 164                      | 209                      |\n| Sweden                          | 146                      | 162                      |\n| Norway                          | 134                      | 203                      |\n| Other countries                 | 1,272                    | 1,612                    |\n|                                 | 10,356                   | 11,752                   |\n\n|                                 | 31 December       | 31 December       |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Revenue from external customers | 2020  USD million | 2019  USD million |\n| Russia                          | 11,870            | 12,587            |\n| Ireland                         | 606               | 655               |\n| Guinea                          | 225               | 230               |\n| Ukraine                         | 229               | 158               |\n| Unallocated                     | 3,132             | 3,183             |\n|                                 | 16,062            | 16,813            |",

        "page_content": "## 5. Revenues\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. The details of significant accounting policies in relation to the Group's various goods and services are set out below:\n\nSales of goods: comprise sale of primary aluminium, alloys, alumina, bauxite and other products. Customers obtain control of the goods supplied when the goods are delivered to the point when risks are transferred based on Incoterms delivery terms stated in the contract. Invoices are generated and revenue is recognised at that point in time. Invoices are usually payable within 60 days or in advance. Under certain Group sale contracts, the final price for the goods shipped is determined a few months later than the delivery took place. Under current requirements the Group determines the amount of revenue at the moment of recognition based on estimated selling price at the date of the invoice issued. At price finalisation the difference between estimated price and actual one is recognised as other revenue.\n\nRendering of transportation services: as part of sales of goods the Group also performs transportation to the customer under contract terms. In certain cases, the control of goods delivered is transferred to customers prior to transportation being completed.

Personnel costs\n\nPersonnel costs comprise salaries, annual bonuses, annual leave and cost of non-monetary benefits. Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and cost of non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees. Where payment or settlement is deferred and the effect would be material, these amounts are stated at their present values.\n\nThe employees of the Group are also members of retirement schemes operated by local authorities. The Group is required to contribute a certain percentage of their payroll to these schemes to fund the benefits.\n\nThe Group's total contribution to those schemes charged to profit or loss during the years presented is shown below.The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value\n\nof any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nWhere there is a change in actuarial assumptions, the resulting actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nThe Group recognises gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any resulting change in the fair value of plan assets, any change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, any related actuarial gains and losses.The Group also makes contributions for the benefit of employees to Russia's and the Ukrainian State's pension funds. The contributions are expensed as incurred.\n\n|                                                        | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                        | 2020  USD million        | 2019  USD million        |\n| Contributions to defined contribution retirement plans | (225)                    | (254)                    |\n| Contributions to defined benefit retirement plans      | (5)                      | (4)                      |\n| Total retirement costs                                 | (230)                    | (258)                    |\n| Wages and salaries                                     | (1,023)                  | (1,058)                  |\n|                                                        | (1,253)                  | (1,316)                  |",

        "page_content": "## 10. Income tax expense\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities. Such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expenses in the period that such a determination is made. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group has both the right and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or simultaneous basis.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nAdditional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividends is recognised.\n\n## (a) Income tax expense\n\n|                                                   | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                   | 2020  USD million        | 2019  USD million        |\n| Current tax expense                               |                          |                          |\n| Current tax for the year                          | (223)                    | (369)                    |\n| Deferred tax expense                              |                          |                          |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences | 114                      | 93                       |\n|                                                   | (109)                    | (276)                    |\n\nOn 9 July 2019, the Parent Company redomiciled to Russia's SAR (special administrative region) and became a Russian tax resident. Companies which register in the SAR as part of the continuance out of a foreign jurisdiction (such as the Parent Company) may have a number of tax benefits, subject to certain conditions. Before redomiciliation, the Parent Company was a tax resident of Cyprus.\n\nThe Parent Company and subsidiaries pay income taxes in accordance with the legislative requirements of their respective tax jurisdictions. For companies domiciled in Russia the applicable tax rate is 20%; in Ukraine of 18%; Guinea of 0%; China of 25%; Kazakhstan of 20%; Australia of 30%; Jamaica of 25%; Ireland of 12.5%, Sweden of 21.4% and Italy of 27.9%. For the Group's subsidiaries domiciled in Switzerland the applicable tax rate for the year is the corporate income tax rate in the Canton of Zug, Switzerland, which differs depending on the company's tax status. The rate consists of a federal income tax and a cantonal/communal income and capital taxes. The latter includes a base rate and a multiplier, which may change from year to year. Applicable income tax rate is 11.91% for Swiss subsidiaries. For the UC RUSAL's significant trading companies, the applicable tax rate is 0%. The applicable tax rates for the year ended 31 December 2019 were the same as for the year ended 31 December 2020 except for tax rates for subsidiaries domiciled in Switzerland which amounted to 9.55% and 14.35% accordingly.",

Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (a) Accounting policy\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nUntil 1 January 2016, all items of property, plant and equipment were measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRSs, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is capitalised and depreciated over the expected production period.\n\nGains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment in profit or loss.\n\nMost of the hydro assets have long useful lives (up to 100 years) and their performance does not deteriorate significantly. Considering recent changes in the regulation of the Russian power sector (100% liberalisation) and the fact that hydropower is one of the most efficient sectors of the electric power industry, management believes that hydropower assets were significantly undervalued prior to 1 January 2016.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, the Group identified a separate class of assets - hydro assets - and changed its accounting policy for this class from the cost to the revaluation model to provide users with more relevant information on the Group's financial position.",

        "page_content": "Hydro assets are a class of property, plant and equipment with unique nature and use in their hydropower plants. Since 1 January 2016, hydro assets are measured at a revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are made based on periodic valuation by an external independent valuer.\n\nA class of assets may be revalued on a rolling basis provided that revaluations of the class of assets are completed within a short period and provided the revaluations are kept up to date.\n\nAfter an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, any accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount restated to the revalued amount of the asset.\n\nA revaluation increase on hydro assets is recognised directly under the heading of revaluation surplus in other comprehensive income. However, the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A revaluation decrease on hydro assets is recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent costs\n\nThe cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-today servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Exploration and evaluation assets\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation activities include:\n\n- - researching and analysing historical exploration data;\n- - gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;\n- - exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;\n- - determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource;\n- - surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; and\n- - conducting market and finance studies.\n\nAdministration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to profit or loss. License costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets when it is expected that expenditure related to an area of interest will be recouped by future exploitation, sale, or, at the reporting date, the exploration and evaluation activities have not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable ore reserves. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment at cost less impairment losses. As the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications of impairment. Where there are indicators of potential impairment, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the group of operating assets (representing a cash-generating unit, CGU) to which the exploration is attributed. Exploration areas at which reserves have been discovered but which require major capital expenditure before production can begin are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration work is underway or planned. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered it is charged to profit or loss.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets are transferred to mining property, plant and equipment or intangible assets when development is sanctioned.",

Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and any change in estimate is taken into account in the determination of remaining depreciation charges. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAny accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross amount of the assets, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.\n\nThe property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis over the respective estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- - Hydro assets\n\npredominantly 49 to 62 years;\n\n- - Buildings and constructions\n\npredominantly 15 to 50 years;\n\n- - Machinery and equipment\n\n4 to 50 years;\n\n- - Electrolysers\n\n4 to 15 years;\n\n- - Mining assets\n\nunits of production on proven and probable reserves;\n\n- - Other\n\n1 to 30 years.",

These include a significant decrease of aluminium and alumina prices during the year as a result of LME depreciation and overall market instability, fluctuations of coal sale prices and additional volumes of electricity transmission set in further periods as well as separation of new CHPs CGU (refer below). Despite LME recovery during last quarter of 2020, market forecasts demonstrate slightly depressed level of prices compared to the spot prices as at reporting date. In aluminium production, the Group benefited from decreases in cash costs due to depreciation of the Russian rouble against the USD as almost all aluminium plants of the Group are located in Russia. For alumina cash generating units, the major influences were a decrease in alumina prices and favourable dynamics in energy prices being a significant part of cash cost. For bauxite cash generating units, bauxite sales prices were generally stable. For Irkutsk GridCo cash generating unit the regulated tariffs were set for additional volumes of electricity transmission from 2021.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, value in use of each cash generating unit was determined by discounting expected future net cash flows of the cash generating unit. Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units' recoverable amount was based on external sources of information and historic data. Management believes that the values assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic assessment of future trends. The risk factors related to future COVID-19 uncertainties have been incorporated into the discount rates applied.\n\n## METALS\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, management identified several indicators that a number of the Group's CGUs may be impaired or that previously recognised impairment losses may need to be reversed.\n\nBased on results of impairment testing as at 31 December 2020, management has concluded that a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in these consolidated financial statements in respect of Taishet aluminium smelter (aluminium smelter under construction) and Mykolaiv alumina refinery in the amount of USD 158 million.\n\nBased on results of impairment testing as at 31 December 2019, management concluded that a reversal of previously recognised impairment losses relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in respect of Aughinish and Cobad cash generating units in the amount of USD 363 million. Additionally, management concluded that impairment losses in respect of KAZ, VgAZ, BAZ and UAZ, Kubal, Kremny and Windalco cash generating units, in the amount of USD 545 million should be recognised.",

These assets have been impaired in full. No further impairment of property, plant and equipment or reversal of previously recorded impairment was identified.\n\n## POWER\n\nThe Irkutsk region coal-fired heat business (note 4(a)) was spin-off during the year thus creating two CGUs from Irkutskenergo CGU, CHPs and Angara HPPs, requiring separate analysis and impairment testing. The main assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the Angara HPPs CGU are disclosed in note 12(d).\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 2019, management identified several indicators that property, plant and equipment of the Coal, Irkutsk GridCo and CHPs cash-generating units (CGUs) may be impaired or that previously recognised impairment losses may need to be reversed.\n\nBased on results of impairment testing as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, management concluded that no impairment losses or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses should be recognised.",

        "page_content": "## (d) Security\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment which is subject to lien under loan agreements was USD 1,086 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 1,262 million) (note 17).\n\n## (e) Hydro assets\n\nAs disclosed in note 11(a)(i), the Group regularly performs an independent valuation of its hydro assets. As at 31 December 2020, the independent appraiser estimated the fair value of hydro assets at USD 3,443 million with an equity effect of USD 230 million and revaluation loss of USD nil million recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe valuation analysis was primarily based on the cost approach to determine depreciated replacement cost as it is the most reliable method to estimate value for assets that do not have an active market and do not generate an identifiable revenue stream by asset. This method considers the cost to reproduce or replace the property, plant and equipment, adjusted for physical depreciation, functional and economic obsolescence.\n\nDepreciated replacement cost was estimated based on internal sources and, where available, analysis of the Russian and international markets for similar property, plant and equipment. Various market data were collected from published information, catalogues, statistical data etc.\n\nIn addition, cash flow testing was conducted to identify if there is any economic obsolescence of the hydro assets. Forecasts of net cash flows were determined based on the actual results for the preceding years and approved budgets. Based on the analysis results, there was no economic obsolescence as at 31 December 2020 or 2019. The fair value measurement for hydro assets have been categorised as Level 3 fair values based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, a valuation by external independent appraiser was not performed because based on management's analysis, the fair value of hydro assets approximated their carrying amount at that date.\n\nNet book value as at 31 December 2020 according to the cost model amounted to USD 333 million (31 December 2019: USD 404 million).\n\n## (f) Leases\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on whether the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of properties in which Group acts as a lessee, the Group does not separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe Group applies judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options, the assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised.\n\nIn determining the enforceable period (i.e. the maximum lease term), the Group considers whether both it and the lessor has a right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party and, if so, whether that termination would result in more than an insignificant penalty. If a more than insignificant penalty exists, then the enforceable period extends until the point at which a no more than an insignificant penalty exists.\n\nThe Group leases many assets, including land, properties and production equipment. The Group recognises a rightof-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability as required by IFRS 16.\n\nThe cost comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.",

        "page_content": "The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets as part of property plant and equipment, the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns. Additions to right-of-use assets were in the amount of USD 68 million during the year ended 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 9 million). The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets are presented below.\n\n|                             | Property, plant and equipment   | Property, plant and equipment   | Property, plant and equipment   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| USD Million                 | Land and buildings              | Machinery and  equipment        | Total                           |\n| Balance at 1 January 2020   | 34                              | 7                               | 41                              |\n| Balance at 31 December 2020 | 67                              | 4                               | 71                              |\n\nTotal depreciation charges related to the right-of-use assets for the year ended 31 December 2020 amount to USD 20 million (31 December 2019: USD 11 million).\n\nUSD 2 million of right-of-use assets have been impaired during the year ended 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 8 million). The Group's total cash outflow for leases was in the amount of USD 29 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 15 million).\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16 variable payments which do not depend on index or rate, e. g. which do not reflect changes in market rental rates, should not be included in the measurement of lease liability. In respect of municipal or federal land leases where lease payments are based on cadastral value of the land plot and do not change until the next revision of that value or the applicable rates (or both) by the authorities, the Group has determined that, under the current revision mechanism, the land lease payments cannot be considered as either variable that depend on index or rate or in-substance fixed, and therefore these payments are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. Future cash outflows to which the Group is potentially exposed that are not recognised in right-to-use assets and are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities and which arise from variable lease payments not linked to index or rate are in the amount of USD 173 million as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 145 million).\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payment made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nThe Group presents lease liabilities as part of other payables and other non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position depending on the period to which future lease payments relate. Total non-current part of lease liabilities as at 31 December 2020 amounted to USD 57 million (31 December 2019: USD 33 million).\n\nTotal interest costs on leases recognised for the year ended 31 December 2020 amount to USD 9 million (31 December 2019: USD 6 million).\n\nThe Group does not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The expense relating to short-term leases in the amount of USD 18 million is included in cost of sales or administrative expenses depending on type of underlying asset for the year ended 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 34 million).\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor the sub-leases are classified with reference to the right-of the use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.",

Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## (a) Accounting policy\n\n## (i) Goodwill\n\nOn the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest in a joint venture or an associate or an interest in a joint arrangement that comprises a business, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business (or interest in a business) are recognised at their fair values unless the fair values cannot be measured reliably. Where the fair values of assumed contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised but the contingent liability is disclosed in the same manner as for other contingent liabilities.\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.\n\nGoodwill arises when the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. For this purpose, goodwill arising on a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition and any impairment loss recognised is not reversed even where circumstances indicate a recovery in value.\n\nIn respect of associates or joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture and the investment as a whole is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of impairment. Any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture.\n\nWhen the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Research and development\n\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss when incurred.\n\nDevelopment activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss when incurred.\n\nCapitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses (refer to note 11(c)).",

These units represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each business, and the related impairment losses recognised, are as follows:\n\n| USD million                                      | Allocated goodwill 2020   | Accumulated  impairment loss 2020   | Allocated goodwill 2019   | Accumulated  impairment loss 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| UC RUSAL                                         | 2,273                     | (449)                               | 2,429                     | (449)                               |\n| Angara HPPs (Irkutskenergo)                      | 211                       | -                                   | 256                       | -                                   |\n| Strikeforce Mining and Resources Limited ('SMR') | 1                         | (1)                                 | 1                         | (1)                                 |\n|                                                  | 2,485                     | (450)                               | 2,686                     | (450)                               |\n\n## METALS\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, the entire amount of goodwill is allocated to the aluminium segment of UC RUSAL's operations, except for goodwill arisen from PGLZ LLC acquisition (note 15(e)). The aluminium segment represents the lowest level within UC RUSAL at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount represents value in use as determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the plants within UC RUSAL's aluminium segment.\n\nSimilar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, management analysed changes in the economic environment and developments in the aluminium industry and the Group's operations since 31 December 2019 and performed an impairment test for goodwill at 31 December 2020 using the following assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the segment:\n\n- - Total production was estimated based on average sustainable production levels of 3.8 million metric tonnes of primary aluminium, of 8.5 million metric tonnes of alumina and of 15.7 million metric tonnes of bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used primarily internally for production of primary aluminium;\n- - Aluminium sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available industry and market sources at USD 1,919 per tonne for primary aluminium in 2021, USD 1,906 in 2022, USD 1,927 in 2023, USD 1,955 in 2024, USD 2,003 in 2025. Alumina prices were derived from the same sources as aluminium prices at USD 295 per tonne for alumina in 2021, USD 304 in 2022, USD 307 in 2023, USD 318 in 2024, USD 335 in 2025. Operating costs were projected based on the historical performance adjusted for inflation;\n- - Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to convert operating costs of the Group denominated in RUB into USD were RUB 73.2 for one USD in 2021, RUB 71.9 in 2022, RUB 71.2 in 2023, RUB 72.5 in 2024, RUB 74.1 in 2025. Inflation of 3.8%-4.1% in RUB and 1.5%-2.2% in USD was assumed in determining recoverable amounts;\n- - The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal terms based on the weighted average cost of capital basis and was 11.4%;\n- - A terminal value was derived following the forecast period assuming a 2.0% annual growth rate.\n\nValues assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units' recoverable amount was based on external sources of information and historic data. Management believes that the values assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic assessment of future trends. The results were particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:\n\n- - A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium and alumina price levels would result in a decrease in the recoverable amount by 33% but would not lead to an impairment;\n- - A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would have resulted in a 25% decrease in the recoverable amount but would not lead to an impairment;\n- - A 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 11% decrease in the recoverable amount but would not lead to an impairment.",

Bauxite and alumina are primarily used internally for the production of primary aluminium;\n- - Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available industry and market sources at USD 1,802 per tonne for primary aluminium in 2020, USD 1,860 in 2021, USD 1,952 in 2022, USD 2,028 in 2023, USD 2,099 in 2024.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Angara HPPs CGU. In 2019 goodwill was allocated to Irkutskenergo CGU (see note 11(c)). It represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nManagement performs impairment testing of goodwill annually at 31 December of the respective calendar year.\n\nThe recoverable amount of Angara HPPs in 2020 and Irkutskenergo in 2019 was determined by reference to its value in use derived by discounting of the future cash flows generated from continuing use of production facilities.\n\nThe following key assumptions were used to determine the recoverable amount of the Angara HPPs cash-generating unit at 31 December 2020:\n\n- - The sales volumes in 2020 were projected based on the approved budgets for 2021. In particular, the sales volumes of electricity in 2021 and 2022 were planned at the level of 48 million MWh with an insignificant decline by 1% till 2030.\n- - Sales prices were based on the long-term price outlook derived from the available industry and market sources. The prices for electricity were estimated at the levels of USD 0.5-11.5 (RUB 39-846) per MWh depending on market segment in 2021 and increased by 19-40% respectively till 2030. Operating costs were projected based on the historical performance and the anticipated increase during the projected period was in line with inflation.\n- - The post-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal terms based on the weighted average cost of capital amounted to 12.9%;\n- - A terminal value was derived following the forecast period assuming a 4% annual growth rate.",

In particular, the sales volumes of electricity in 2020 and 2021 were planned at the level of 70 million MWh. The expected growth till 2029 was estimated as 1.1% as compared to 2020. The sales volumes of heat in 2020 were planned at the level of 20 million Gcal and no growth till 2029 is expected.\n- - Sales prices were based on the long-term price outlook derived from the available industry and market sources. The prices for electricity were estimated at the levels of USD 0.5-27.2 (RUB 34-1,759) per MWh depending on market segment in 2020 and increased by 17-51% respectively till 2029. The tariffs for heat were estimated as USD 17.5 (RUB 1,133) per Gcal in 2020 and grew by 52% till 2029.

Interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group or Company has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, including participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement whereby the Group or Company and other parties contractually agree to share control of the arrangement and have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAn investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method, unless it is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale). Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost, adjusted for any excess of the Group's share of the acquisition-date fair values of the investee's identifiable net assets over the cost of the investment (if any). Thereafter, the investment is adjusted for the post acquisition change in the Group's share of the investee's net assets and any impairment losses relating to the investment. Any acquisition-date excess over cost, the Group's share of the post-acquisition, post-tax results of the investees and any impairment losses for the year are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, whereas the Group's share of the postacquisition post-tax items of the investees' other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in the associate or the joint venture, the Group's interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nUnrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee, except where unrealised losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case they are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nIf an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or vice versa, retained interest is not remeasured. Instead, the investment continues to be accounted for under the equity method.\n\nIn all other cases, when the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate or joint control over a joint venture, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that investee, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in that former investee at the date when significant influence or joint control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset.\n\nIn the Group's statement of financial position, investments in associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment losses, unless classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale).",

        "page_content": "An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an associate or joint venture is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount after application of the equity method of accounting and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of such investment is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. In determining the value in use of the investment the Group estimates: (a) its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee, including the cash flows from the operations of the investee and the proceeds on the ultimate disposal of the investment; or (b) the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the dividends to be received from the investee and from its ultimate disposal depending on which available information with respect to each investee is more reliable. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases and the resulting carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, after application of the equity method, had no impairment loss previously been recognised.\n\n|                                                                 | 31 December      | 31 December      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                 | 2020 USD million | 2019 USD million |\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                            | 4,248            | 3,701            |\n| Group's share of profits, impairment and reversal of impairment | 971              | 1,669            |\n| Acquisition and contribution to investments                     | 9                | 78               |\n| Return of prepayment for shares                                 | (11)             | (41)             |\n| Dividends                                                       | (718)            | (1,609)          |\n| Foreign currency translation                                    | (667)            | 450              |\n| Balance at the end of the year                                  | 3,832            | 4,248            |\n| Goodwill included in interests in associates                    | 2,034            | 2,428            |\n\nThe following list contains only the particulars of associates, all of which are corporate entities, which principally affected the results or assets of the Group.\n\n|                                  |                                        |                                                                 | Proportion of ownership interest   | Proportion of ownership interest   |                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Name of associate/ joint venture | Place of  incorporation and  operation | Particulars of  issued and paid up  capital                     | Group's effective  interest        | Group's nominal  interest          | Principal activity                                 |\n| PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel          | Russian  Federation                    | 158,245,476  shares, RUB 1 par value                            | 15.82%                             | 27.82%                             | Nickel and other  metals  production Production of |\n| Queensland Alumina Limited       | Australia                              | 2,212,000 shares,  AUD 2 par value                              | 11.38%                             | 20%                                | alumina under  a tolling  agreement                |\n| BEMO project                     | Cyprus, Russian  Federation            | BOGES Limited and BALP  Limited -

Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in securities, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and tax assets), cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables (excluding advances received and tax liabilities).\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments except for trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Trade and other receivables are recognised at transaction price.\n\nA financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the Group's contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group's obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. The details of significant accounting policies are set out below.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 specifies three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') and fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.\n\nThe Group's financial assets mostly fall within category of financial assets measured at amortised cost. The only exception is derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss and cash flow hedges accounted through other comprehensive income (note 19) and other investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (note 15(e)). The same applies to the Group's financial liabilities.\n\n## (a) Impairment of trade receivables\n\nUnder IFRS 9, loss allowances (expected credit losses - ECL) are measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- - 12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and\n- - lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. The Group measures loss allowances for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\n- - the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or\n- - the financial asset is more than 90 days past due, but additional analysis is conducted for each such receivable and assessment is updated accordingly.\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.",

        "page_content": "ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset in case of long-term assets.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are presented as part of net other operating expenses.\n\nThe following analysis provides further detail about the calculation of ECLs related to trade receivables. The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from the customers. Loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off. The ECLs were calculated based on actual credit loss experience over the past two years. The Group performed the calculation of ECL rates separately for the customers of each key trading company of the Group. Exposures within each trading company were not further segmented except for individually significant customers which bear specific credit risk depending on the repayment history of the customer and relationship with the Group.\n\n## METALS\n\nThe following table provides information about determined ECLs rates for trade receivables both as at 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020.\n\n|                            | Weighted-average loss rate   | Weighted-average loss rate   |                 |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                            | 1 January 2020               | 31 December 2020             | Credit-impaired |\n| Current (not past due)     | 1%                           | 1%                           | No              |\n| 1-30 days past due         | 4%                           | 4%                           | No              |\n| 31-60 days past due        | 11%                          | 10%                          | No              |\n| 61-90 days past due        | 80%                          | 71%                          | No              |\n| More than 90 days past due | 92%                          | 86%                          | Yes             |\n\n## POWER\n\nThe following table provides information about determined ECLs rates for trade receivables both as at 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020.\n\n|                             | Weighted-average loss rate   | Weighted-average loss rate   |                 |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                             | 1 January 2020               | 31 December 2020             | Credit-impaired |\n| Current (not past due)      | 1%                           | 1%                           | No              |\n| 1-90 days past due          | 1%                           | 1%                           | No              |\n| 90-180 days past due        | 30%                          | 30%                          | No              |\n| More than 180 days past due | 100%                         | 100%                         | Yes             |\n\nFluctuations reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.\n\nImpairment losses in respect of trade receivables are recorded using an allowance account unless the Group is satisfied that recovery of the amount is remote, in which case the impairment loss is written off against trade receivables directly.",

The Group has determined that together the acquired inputs and processes significantly contribute to the ability to create revenue and has concluded that the acquired set is a business. Total consideration paid amounted to USD 71 million and was paid in cash as at 1 January 2020. Fair value of acquired assets and liabilities amounted to USD 24 million from which USD 21 million related to property, plant and equipment (note 11).\n\n## 16. Equity\n\n## (a) Share capital, additional paid-in capital and transactions with shareholders\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Parent Company's share capital is divided into 638,848,896 ordinary shares with a nominal value of USD 0.00007 each. The Parent Company may also issue 75,436,818.286 ordinary shares.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, all issued ordinary shares were fully paid.\n\n## (i) Glencore deal\n\nOn 26 January 2019, the Parent Company issued 67,420,324 shares with a par value of USD 0.00007 each with a subsequent issue of GDRs on these shares, to Glencore Group Funding Limited pursuant to a securities exchange agreement in exchange for 8.75% shares in UC RUSAL ('Glencore deal').\n\nDue to certain regulatory requirements, under the securities exchange agreement, Glencore has agreed to transfer its stake in UC RUSAL to the Parent Company in two stages. The first stage was settled on 31 January 2019 and 1.97% of RUSAL's shares was transferred to the Parent Company following the removal of the Parent Company and UC RUSAL from the SDN list (see note 1(d)), the remaining 6.78% of UC RUSAL's shares were transferred on 3 February 2020.\n\nUnder the Group's accounting policy, the Glencore deal was accounted for under the anticipated-acquisition method, as if the remaining 6.78% of UC RUSAL's shares had already been transferred. Fair value of the consideration transferred was determined with reference to market quotations on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAs a result of the Glencore deal, non-controlling interests decreased by USD 435 million with respective increases of share premium of USD 543 million and other reserves of USD 251 million, and decreases of foreign currency translation reserve and accumulated losses by USD 836 million and USD 477 million, respectively.\n\n## (ii) Acquisition of non-controlling interests\n\nIn 2019, the Group acquired 0.4% of Irkutskenergo shares for USD 5 million, respectively.

Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in additional paid-in capital.\n\nThe reserve for the Group's treasury shares comprises the cost of the Parent Company's shares held by the Group (note 1(a)). At the reporting date the Group held 136,511,122 (31 December 2019: nil) of its own shares.\n\n## (c) Currency translation reserve\n\nThe currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the consolidated financial statements of foreign operations. The reserve is dealt with in accordance with the a ccounting policies set out in note 3(b).\n\n## (d) Other reserves\n\nOther reserves include the cumulative unrealised actuarial gains and losses on the Group's defined post-retirement benefit plans, the effective portion of the accumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedges, the Group's share of other comprehensive income of associates and cumulative unrealised gains and losses on Group's financial assets which have been recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (e) Dividends\n\nDuring the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the Group did not declare and pay dividends.\n\nFollowing redomiciliation in July 2019, the Parent Company may distribute dividends from retained earnings and profit for the reporting period in compliance with the current legislation of the Russian Federation and the provisions of its Charter.\n\n## (f) Revaluation reserve\n\nThe revaluation reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of hydro assets at the reporting date and is dealt with in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 11(a)(i).\n\nAn independent valuation analysis of hydro assets was carried out as at 31 December 2020, the fair value of hydro assets was estimated at USD 3,443 million (note 11(e)).\n\nAs a result of this fair value valuation, the Group recognised an additional revaluation reserve in the amount of USD 184 million net of tax (including USD 180 million attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company).\n\n## (g) Non-controlling interests\n\nThe following table summarises the information relating to each of the Group's subsidiaries that has material non-controlling interest:",

Maturity of the bonds is ten years subject to a bondholders' put option exercisable in June 2023. In addition to the placement, UC RUSAL entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, which resulted in the exchange-traded rouble bonds exposure of RUB 10 billion being translated into an US-dollar exposure with a maturity of 3 years and an interest rate of 2.90%. As at 31 December 2020, crosscurrency interest rate swaps in respect of rouble bonds issued during the year ended 31 December 2019 and the year ended December 2020 were in force which resulted in the exchange-traded rouble bonds exposure being translated in full into an US-dollar exposure with a maturity of 3-3.5 years and an interest rate of 2.90%-4.69%.

        "page_content": "## 18. Provisions\n\n## (a) Accounting policy\n\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance costs.\n\n## (i) Site restoration\n\nThe mining, refining and smelting activities of the Group can give rise to obligations for site restoration and rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation works can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration. The extent of work required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of law and the interpretations of the relevant authorities.\n\nProvisions for the cost of each restoration and rehabilitation program are recognised at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent of disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision is increased accordingly. Costs included in the provision encompass obligated and reasonably estimable restoration and rehabilitation activities expected to occur progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure in connection with disturbances at the reporting date.\n\nRoutine operating costs that may impact the ultimate restoration and rehabilitation activities, such as waste material handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation which is probable and capable of reliable estimation.\n\nRestoration and rehabilitation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value and determined according to the probability of alternative estimates of cash flows occurring for each operation. Discount rates used are specific to the country in which the operation is located. Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing environmental and regulatory requirements.\n\nWhen provisions for restoration and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of restoration and rehabilitation activities is amortised over the estimated economic life of the operation on a units of production or straight-line basis. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognised as part of finance expenses.\n\nRestoration and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments are accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised cost, except where a reduction in the provision is greater than the unamortised capitalised cost, in which case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in profit or loss. Changes to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future amortisation charges. Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing of future restoration and rehabilitation cash flows are a normal occurrence in light of the significant judgements and estimates involved. Factors influencing those changes include revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations; developments in technology; regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies; changes in the estimated costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and movements in foreign exchange rates; and movements in general interest rates affecting the discount rate applied.",

        "page_content": "## (ii) Legal claim\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group may be involved in legal proceedings. Where management considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings will result in the Group compensating third parties, a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Where management considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings will not result in the Group compensating third parties or where, in rare circumstances, it is not considered possible to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount expected to be paid, no provision is made for any potential liability under the litigation but the circumstances and uncertainties involved are disclosed as contingent liabilities. The assessment of the likely outcome of legal proceedings and the amount of any potential liability involves significant judgement. As law and regulations in many of the countries in which the Group operates are continuing to evolve, particularly in the areas of taxation, sub-soil rights and protection of the environment, uncertainties regarding litigation and regulation are greater than those typically found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\n## (b) Disclosure\n\n| USD million                          | Pension liabilities   | Site restoration   | Provisions for  legal claims   | Tax provisions   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|---------|\n| Balance at 1 January 2019            | 89                    | 411                | 10                             | 20               | 530     |\n| Non-current                          | 82                    | 377                | -                              | -                | 459     |\n| Current                              | 7                     | 34                 | 10                             | 20               | 71      |\n| Provisions made during the year      | 13                    | 47                 | 24                             | -                | 84      |\n| Provisions reversed during the  year | (10)                  | (25)               | -                              | -                | (35)    |\n| Actuarial losses                     | 17                    | -                  | -                              | -                | 17      |\n| Provisions used during the year      | (8)                   | (2)                | -                              | (20)             | (30)    |\n| Change in estimates                  | -                     | 14                 | -                              | -                | 14      |\n| Translation difference               | 10                    | 14                 | 3                              | -                | 27      |\n| Balance at 31 December 2019          | 111                   | 459                | 37                             | -                | 607     |\n| Non-current                          | 104                   | 432                | -                              | -                | 536     |\n| Current                              | 7                     | 27                 | 37                             | -                | 71      |\n| Provisions made during the year      | 13                    | 59                 | 10                             | -                | 82      |\n| Provisions reversed during the  year | (1)                   | (23)               | -                              | -                | (24)    |\n| Actuarial gains                      | (3)                   | -                  | -                              | -                | (3)     |\n| Provisions used during the year      | (7)                   | (3)                | (9)                            | -                | (19)    |\n| Change in estimates                  | -                     | (1)                | -                              | -                | (1)     |\n| Translation difference               | (14)                  | (15)               | (6)                            | -                | (35)    |\n| Balance at 31 December 2020          | 99                    | 476                | 32                             | -                | 607     |\n| Non-current                          | 91                    | 427                | -                              | -                | 518     |\n| Current                              | 8                     | 49                 | 32                             | -                | 89      |\n|                                      | 99                    | 476                | 32                             | -                | 607     |",

The Group also provides pension benefits to eligible participants at facilities located outside of the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\n\n## METALS\n\n## Group subsidiaries in the Russian Federation\n\nThe Group voluntarily provides long-term and post-employment benefits to its former and existing employees including death-in-service, jubilee, lump sum upon retirement, material support for pensioners and death-in-pension benefits. Furthermore, the Group provides regular social support payments to some of its veterans of World War II.\n\nThe above employee benefit programs are of a defined benefit nature.  The Group finances these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.\n\n## Group subsidiaries in Ukraine\n\nDue to legal requirements, the Ukrainian subsidiaries are responsible for partial financing of the state hardship pensions for those of its employees who worked, or still work, under severe and hazardous labour conditions (hardship early retirement pensions).  These pensions are paid until the recipient reaches the age of entitlement to the State old age pension (55-60 years for female (dependent on year of birth) and 60 years for male employees). In Ukraine, the Group also voluntarily provides long-term and post-employment benefits to its employees including death-in-service, lump sum benefits upon retirement and death-in-pension benefits.\n\nThe above employee benefit programs are of a defined benefit nature.  The Group finances these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.\n\n## Group subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation and Ukraine\n\nAt its Guinean entities, the Group provides a death-in-service benefit and lump-sum benefits upon disability and old-age retirement.\n\nAt its Guyana subsidiary, the Group provides a death-in-service benefit.\n\nAt its Italian subsidiary (Eurallumina), the Group only provides lump sum benefits upon retirement, which relate to service up to 1 January 2007.\n\nIn Sweden (Kubikenborg Aluminium AB), the Group provides defined benefit lifelong and temporary pension benefits. The lifelong benefits are dependent on the past service and average salary level of the employee, with an accrual rate that depends on the salary bracket the employee is in.  The liability relates only to benefits accrued before 1 January 2004.\n\nThe number of employees in all jurisdictions eligible for the plans as at 31 December 2020 and 2019 was 48,548 and 46,581, respectively. The number of pensioners in all jurisdictions as at 31 December 2020 and 2019 was 43,422 and 41,699, respectively.\n\nThe Group expects to pay under the defined benefit retirement plans an amount of USD 4 million during the 12 month period beginning on 1 January 2021.",

The Group does not record any obligations with respect to decommissioning of its refining or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the surrounding areas unless there is a specific plan to discontinue operations at a facility. This is because any significant costs in connection with decommissioning of refining or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the surrounding areas would be incurred no earlier than when the facility is closed and the facilities are currently expected to operate over a term in excess of 50-100 years due to the perpetual nature of the refineries and smelters and continuous maintenance and upgrade programs resulting in the fair values of any such liabilities being negligible.\n\nThe site restoration provision relates primarily to mine reclamation and red mud basin disposal sites at alumina refineries and ash dumps removal at coal burning electricity and heat generation stations.\n\nThe principal assumptions used in determining site restoration provision are:\n\n|                                                                                        | 31 December 2020                                                                 | 31 December 2019                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Timing of cash outflows                                                                | 2022-2026: USD 33 million 2027-2037: USD 131 million after 2037: USD 374 million | 2021-2025: USD 223 million 2026-2036: USD 125 million after 2036: USD 240 million |\n| Years required to fill the ash dumps                                                   | 18.1                                                                             | 16.7                                                                              |\n| Discount rate for Irkutskenergo and Coal segment assets after  adjusting for inflation | 2.8%                                                                             | 2.6%                                                                              |",

As at 31 December 2020, there were several claims filed against the Group's subsidiaries contesting breaches of contract terms and non-payment of existing obligations. Management has reviewed the circumstances and estimated that the amount of probable outflow related to these claims should not exceed USD 32 million (31 December 2019: USD 37 million).\n\nAt each reporting date management has assessed the provisions for litigation and claims and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.\n\n## (f) Tax provisions\n\nThe Group generally provides for current tax based on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its tax returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon examination by the tax authorities of the positions taken by the Group additional tax will be payable, the Group provides for its best estimate of the amount expected to be paid (including any interest and/or penalties) as part of the tax charge.\n\nAt each reporting date management has assessed the provisions for taxation and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.\n\n## 19. Derivative financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group enters, from time to time, into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nOn initial designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80%-125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to variation in cash flows that ultimately could affect reported profit or loss.\n\nDerivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.\n\nThe measurement of fair value of derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group's views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates. Changes in the fair value therein are accounted for as described below.",

        "page_content": "When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is included in the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised. In other cases, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nChanges in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives and derivative financial instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Disclosures\n\n|                                                          | 31 December 2020 USD million   | 31 December 2020 USD million   | 31 December 2019 USD million   | 31 December 2019 USD million   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Derivative assets              | Derivative liabilities         | Derivative assets              | Derivative liabilities         |\n| Petroleum coke supply contracts and other raw  materials | 31                             | 43                             | 39                             | 36                             |\n| Forward contracts for aluminium and other  instruments   | 19                             | 9                              | 21                             | 18                             |\n| Cross currency swap (note 17(b))                         | -                              | 133                            | 48                             | -                              |\n| Total                                                    | 50                             | 185                            | 108                            | 54                             |\n| Non-current                                              | 20                             | 28                             | 33                             | 27                             |\n| Current                                                  | 30                             | 157                            | 75                             | 27                             |\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value at each reporting date.

        "page_content": "During the year 2020, there have been no changes in valuation techniques used to calculate the derivative financial instruments compared to prior year.\n\nManagement believes that the values assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic assessment of future trends. The results for the derivative instruments are not particularly sensitive to any factors other than the assumptions disclosed above.\n\nUC RUSAL entered into various petroleum coke supply contracts and other raw materials where the price of coke is determined with reference to the Brent oil price, LME aluminium price and average monthly aluminium quotations. UC RUSAL also sells products to various third parties at prices that are influenced by changes in London Metal Exchange aluminium prices. From time to time UC RUSAL enters into forward sales and purchase contracts for a portion of its anticipated primary aluminium sales and purchases to reduce the risk of fluctuating prices on these sales. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group recognised a total net loss of USD 226 million in relation to the above contracts (31 December 2019: loss of USD 21 million). Unrealised changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income (cash flow hedge) during the period are fully attributable to cross currency swaps (note 17(b)).\n\n## 20. Financial risk management and fair values\n\n## (a) Fair values\n\nManagement believes that the fair values of financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.\n\nThe methods used to estimate the fair values of the financial instruments are as follows:\n\nTrade and other receivables, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, current loans and borrowings and trade and other payables: the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity period of the instruments.\n\nLong-term loans and borrowings, other non-current liabilities: the fair values of other non-current liabilities are based on the present value of the anticipated cash flows and approximate carrying value, other than Eurobonds and RUSAL Bratsk bonds issued.\n\nDerivatives: the fair value of derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group's views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates. Option-based derivatives are valued using Black-Scholes models and Monte-Carlo simulations. The derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value at each reporting date.\n\nThe following table presents the fair value of Group's financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period on a recurring basis, categorised into the three-level fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13, Fair value measurement. The level into which a fair value measurement is classified is determined with reference to the observability and significance of the inputs used in the valuation technique as follows:\n\n- - Level 1 valuations: Fair value measured using only Level 1 inputs i.e. unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n- - Level 2 valuations: Fair value measured using Level 2 inputs i.e. observable inputs which fail to meet Level 1, and not using significant unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are inputs for which market data are not available.\n- - Level 3 valuations: Fair value measured using significant unobservable inputs.",

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\n## (c) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.\n\n## (i) Tariffs and commodity price risk\n\nDuring the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the Group has entered into certain commodity derivatives contracts in order to manage its exposure of commodity price risks.\n\nThe tariffs for electricity, heat and transmission services applied by the Group's significant subsidiaries are currently partially determined by government bodies. The Group cannot directly influence or mitigate the risks in relation to the change in tariffs.\n\nA significant portion of the Group's generation activities is based on coal burning stations. A change in coal prices may have a significant impact on the Group's operations. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in coal prices, the Group has historically increased its internal coal production through acquisition of coal mines and licences in the Eastern Siberia region.\n\n## (ii) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates (note 17). The Group's policy is to manage its interest costs by monitoring changes in interest rates with respect to its borrowings.\n\nThe following table details the interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's borrowings at the reporting date.\n\n|                                    | 31 December 2020           | 31 December 2020   | 31 December 2019           | 31 December 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                    | Effective interest  rate % | USD   million      | Effective interest  rate % | USD   million      |\n| Fixed rate loans and borrowings    |                            |                    |                            |                    |\n| Loans and borrowings (note 17(a))  | 0.01%-10.5%                | 2,700              | 0.01%-11.5%                | 4,942              |\n|                                    |                            | 2,700              |                            | 4,942              |\n| Variable rate loans and borrowings |                            |                    |                            |                    |\n| Loans and borrowings (note 17(a))  | 0.67%-6.25%                | 9,628              | 1.75%-8.25%                | 7,468              |\n|                                    |                            | 9,628              |                            | 7,468              |\n|                                    |                            | 12,328             |                            | 12,410             |",

The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated are RUB, USD and EUR.\n\nBorrowings are primarily denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily USD but also RUB and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.\n\nIn respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances or entering into currency swap arrangements.\n\nThe Group's exposure at the reporting date to foreign currency risk arising from recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity to which they relate is set out in the table below. Differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into the Group's presentation currency are ignored.\n\n|                                                               | USD-denominated vs. RUB   functional currency  31 December   | USD-denominated vs. RUB   functional currency  31 December   | RUB-denominated vs. USD   functional currency  31 December   | RUB-denominated vs. USD   functional currency  31 December   | EUR-denominated vs. USD   functional currency   | EUR-denominated vs. USD   functional currency   | Denominated in other  currencies vs. USD   functional currency  31 December   | Denominated in other  currencies vs. USD   functional currency  31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| USD million                                                   | 2020                                                         | 2019                                                         | 2020                                                         | 2019                                                         | 2020                                            | 2019                                            | 2020                                                                          | 2019                                                                          |\n| Non-current assets                                            | -

The analysis excludes differences that would result from the translation of other financial statements of foreign operations into the Group's presentation currency. The analysis has been performed on the same basis for all years presented.\n\n## (d) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's policy is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents or have available funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet its operating and financial commitments.\n\nThe following tables show the remaining contractual maturities at the reporting date of the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payment computed using contractual rates, or if floating, based on rates current at the reporting date) and the earliest the Group can be required to pay, except loans presented as payable on demand due to breach of covenant:\n\n|                                                         | 31 December 2020  Contractual undiscounted cash outflow   | 31 December 2020  Contractual undiscounted cash outflow   | 31 December 2020  Contractual undiscounted cash outflow   | 31 December 2020  Contractual undiscounted cash outflow   | 31 December 2020  Contractual undiscounted cash outflow   |                              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                         | Within 1 year or  on demand USD million                   | More than  1 year but less  than 2 years USD million      | More than  2 years but less  than 5 years USD million     | More than  5 years USD million                            | TOTAL USD million                                         | Carrying  amount USD million |\n| Trade and other payables to third  parties              | 1,201                                                     | -                                                         | -                                                         | -                                                         | 1,201                                                     | 1,201                        |\n| Trade and other payables to related  parties            | 52                                                        | -                                                         | -                                                         | -                                                         | 52                                                        | 52                           |\n| Bonds, including interest payable                       | 153                                                       | 1,251                                                     | 1,356                                                     | -                                                         | 2,760                                                     | 2,438                        |\n| Loans and borrowings, including  interest payable       | 2,541                                                     | 2,433                                                     | 3,282                                                     | 3,260                                                     | 11,516                                                    | 9,950                        |\n|                                                         | 3,947                                                     | 3,684                                                     | 4,638                                                     | 3,260                                                     | 15,529                                                    | 13,641                       |\n| Financial guarantees issued: Maximum  amount guaranteed | 69                                                        | 45                                                        | -                                                         | -                                                         | 114                                                       | -                            |",

It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The majority of the Group's third party trade receivables represent balances with the world's leading international corporations operating in the metals industry. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. Goods are normally sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. The details of impairment of trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 15. Cash balances are held with high credit quality financial institutions. The extent of the Group's credit exposure is represented by the aggregate balance of financial assets and financial guarantees and loan commitments given.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the Group has no concentration of credit risk within any single largest customer but 5.2% and 14.6% of the total trade receivables were due from the Group's five largest customers.\n\n## (f) Capital risk management\n\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.\n\nThe Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as net operating income divided by total shareholders' equity, excluding non-controlling interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\nThe Board seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.\n\nThere were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries were subject to externally imposed capital requirements in the both years presented in these consolidated financial statements.",

Commitments\n\n## (a) Capital commitments\n\n## METALS\n\nUC RUSAL has entered into contracts that result in contractual obligations primarily relating to various construction and capital repair works. The commitments at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 approximated USD 490 million and USD 298 million, respectively. These commitments are due over a number of years.\n\n## POWER\n\nThe Power segment had outstanding capital commitments which had been contracted for at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 in the amount of USD 269 million and USD 326 million, respectively. These commitments are due over a number of years.\n\n## (b) Purchase commitments\n\nCommitments with third parties for purchases of alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and other purchases in 2021-2034 under supply agreements are estimated from USD 3,256 million to USD 4,644 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 3,257 million to USD 4,135) depending on the actual purchase volumes and applicable prices.\n\nCommitments with related parties for purchases of primary aluminium, alloys and other purchases in 2021-2030 under supply agreements are estimated from USD 4,741 million to USD 6,964 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: USD 5,134 million to USD 8,636 million) depending on the actual purchase volumes and applicable prices.",

There are no commitments with related parties for sales of alumina as at 31 December 2020. Commitments with related parties for sales of alumina in 2020-2024 approximated from USD 413 million to USD 771 million at 31 December 2019.\n\nCommitments with related parties for sales of primary aluminium and alloys in 2021 are estimated from USD 224 million to USD 269 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: from USD 375 million to USD 563 million). Commitments with third parties for sales of primary aluminium and alloys in 2021-2025 are estimated to range from USD 7,738 million to USD 11,602 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: from USD 1,720 million to USD 2,559 million).\n\n## (d) Social commitments\n\nThe Group contributes to the maintenance and upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare of its employees, including contributions toward the development and maintenance of housing, hospitals, transport services, recreation and other social needs of the regions of the Russian Federation where the Group's production entities are located. The funding of such assistance is periodically determined by management and is appropriately capitalised or expensed as incurred.\n\n## 22. Contingencies\n\n## (a) Taxation\n\nRussian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management's interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may be challenged by the relevant local, regional and federal authorities. Notably recent developments in the Russian environment suggest that the authorities in this country are becoming more active in seeking to enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of the tax legislation, in particular in relation to the use of certain commercial trading structures, which may be selective for particular tax payers and different from the authorities' previous interpretations or practices. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities are taking\n\na more assertive and substance-based position in their interpretation and enforcement of tax legislation.\n\nThe Russian taxation system is continually evolving and is subject to frequent changes, starting from 1 January 2015, changes aimed at regulating tax consequences of transactions with foreign companies and their activities were introduced, such as the concept of beneficial ownership of income, taxation of controlled foreign companies, tax residency rules, country-by-country reporting etc. This legislation and practice of its application is still evolving and the impact of legislative changes should be considered based on the actual circumstances.\n\nAll these circumstances may create tax risks in the Russian Federation that are substantially more significant than in other countries. Management believes that it has provided adequately for tax liabilities based on its interpretations of applicable Russian tax legislation, official pronouncements and court decisions. However, the interpretations of the tax authorities and courts, especially due to reform of the supreme courts that are resolving tax disputes, could differ and the effect on these consolidated financial statements, if the authorities were successful in enforcing their interpretations, could be significant.\n\nIn addition to the amounts of income tax the Group has provided, there are certain tax positions taken by the Group where it is reasonably possible (though less than 50% likely) that additional tax may be payable upon examination by the tax authorities or in connection with ongoing disputes with tax authorities. The Group's best estimate of the aggregate maximum of additional amounts that it is reasonably possible may become payable if these tax positions were not sustained at 31 December 2020 is USD 36 million (31 December 2019: USD 34 million).",

        "page_content": "## (b) Environmental contingencies\n\nThe Group and its predecessor entities have operated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Guyana, the Republic of Guinea and the European Union for many years and certain environmental problems have developed. Governmental authorities are continually considering environmental regulations and their enforcement and the Group periodically evaluates its obligations related thereto. As obligations are determined, they are recognised immediately. The outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or any future legislation, or as a result of stricter enforcement of existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated. Under current levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management believes there are no possible liabilities, which will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or the operating results of the Group. However, the Group anticipates undertaking significant capital projects to improve its future environmental performance.\n\n## (c) Legal contingencies\n\nThe Group's business activities expose it to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and contested on an ongoing basis. Where management believes that a lawsuit or another claim would result in the outflow of the economic benefits for the Group, a best estimate of such outflow is included in provisions in the consolidated financial statements (note 18(e)). As at 31 December 2020, the amount of claims, where management assesses outflow as possible approximates USD 21 million (31 December 2019: USD 21 million).\n\n## (d) Other contingent liabilities\n\nWhere the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of related parties, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.\n\nIn September 2013, UC RUSAL and PJSC RusHydro entered into an agreement with BoAZ to provide loans, if the latter is unable to fulfil its obligations under its credit facilities. The aggregate exposure under the agreement is limited to RUB 16.8 billion (31 December 2020 and 2019 USD 227 million and USD 272 million, respectively) and is split between the Group and PJSC RusHydro in equal proportion.\n\n## 23. Related party transactions\n\n## (a) Accounting policy\n\n- (a) A person, or a close member of that person's family, is related to the Group if that person:\n- (i) has control or joint control over the Group;\n- (ii) has significant influence over the Group; or\n- (iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or the Group's parent.\n\n(b) An entity is related to the Group if any of the following conditions applies:\n\n- (i) The entity and the Group are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).\n- (ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).\n- (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.\n- (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.\n- (iv) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the Group or an entity related to the Group.\n- (vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).\n- (vii)   A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).\n- (viii)  The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the group or to the group's parent.\n\nClose members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence, or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity.",

        "page_content": "## 25. Accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group has identified the following critical accounting policies under which significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are made and where actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect financial results of the financial position reported in future periods.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - recoverable amount\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policy, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that carrying amount exceeds recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating group of assets is measured at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nFair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, and is generally determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal.\n\nValue in use is also generally determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, but only those expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. Present values are determined using a risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the asset. Future cash flow estimates are based on expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), reserves (refer 'Reserve estimates' below), operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. This policy requires management to make these estimates and assumptions which are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying value of the assets may be impaired and the impairment would be charged against the profit or loss.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - hydro assets - fair value\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policy, hydro assets are carried at a revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe valuation analysis is primarily based on the cost approach to determine depreciated replacement cost. This method considers the cost to reproduce or replace the property, plant and equipment, adjusted for physical depreciation, functional and economic obsolescence.\n\nThis policy requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding both costs, as there is no active market for used assets of that type, and macroeconomic indicators to assess economic obsolescence which are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these estimates, which may impact the fair value of hydro assets. In such circumstances, the fair value of hydro assets may be lower with any consequential decrease in revaluation reserve recognised through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Inventories - net realisable value\n\nThe Group recognises write-downs of inventories based on an assessment of the net realisable value of the inventories. A write-down is applied to the inventories where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net realisable value is less than cost. The determination of net realisable value requires the use of judgement and estimates. Where the expectation is different from the original estimates, such a difference will impact the carrying value of the inventories and the write-down of inventories charged to the profit or loss in the periods in which such estimate has been changed.",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill - recoverable amount\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policy, goodwill is allocated to the Group's reportable business segments as they represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is tested for impairment annually at 31 December by preparing a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is estimated as the value in use of the business segment.\n\nSimilar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures - recoverable amount\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policies, each investment in an associate or joint venture is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment after application of the equity method of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or joint venture is measured at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nSimilar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment apply to investments in associates or joint ventures. In addition to the considerations described above the Group may also assess the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from dividends to be received from the investment, if such information is available and considered reliable.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group may be involved in legal proceedings. Where management considers that it more likely than not that proceedings will result in the Group compensating third parties a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Where management considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings will not result in the Group compensating third parties or where, in rare circumstances, it is not considered possible to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount expected to be paid, no provision is made for any potential liability under the litigation but the circumstances and uncertainties involved are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nThe assessment of the likely outcome of legal proceedings and the amount of any potential liability involves significant judgement. As law and regulations in many of the countries in which the Group operates are continuing to evolve, particularly in the areas of taxation, sub-soil rights and protection of the environment, uncertainties regarding litigation and regulation are greater than those typically found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\n## Provision for restoration and rehabilitation\n\nThe Group's accounting policy requires the recognition of provisions for the restoration and rehabilitation of each site when a legal or constructive obligation exists to dismantle the assets and restore the site. The provision recognised represents management's best estimate of the present value of the future costs required. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the amount of restoration and rehabilitation provisions. Those estimates and assumptions deal with uncertainties such as: changes to the relevant legal and regulatory framework; the magnitude of possible contamination and the timing, extent and costs of required restoration and rehabilitation activity. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.\n\nThe provision recognised for each site is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs for operating sites are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting both the restoration and rehabilitation asset and provision. Such changes give rise to a change in future depreciation and interest charges. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation\n\nThe Group's accounting policy for taxation requires management's judgement in assessing whether deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from carried forward tax losses, capital losses and temporary differences, are recognised only where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences in investments, caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nAssumptions about the generation of future taxable profits and repatriation of retained earnings depend on management's estimates of future cash flows. These depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, dividends and other capital management transactions. Assumptions are also required about the application of income tax legislation. These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the statement of financial position and the amount of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group generally provides for current tax based on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its tax returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon examination by the tax authorities of the positions taken by the Group additional tax will be payable, the Group provides for its best estimate of the amount expected to be paid (including any interest and/or penalties) as part of the tax charge.\n\n## Reserve estimates\n\nReserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group's properties. In order to calculate reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.\n\nThe Group determines ore reserves under the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves September 1999, known as the JORC Code. The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable investment assumptions to calculate reserves.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or grade of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or fields to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling samples. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.\n\nSince economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and since additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period.\n\nChanges in reported reserves may affect the Group's financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:\n\n- - Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows.\n- - Depletion charged in profit or loss may change where such charges are determined by the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change.\n- - Decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation expenditure\n\nThe Group's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Development expenditure\n\nDevelopment activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project has reached a stage at which economically recoverable reserves exist such that development may be sanctioned. In exercising this judgement, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having commenced the development activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is impaired, the appropriate amount will be written off to profit or loss.\n\n## Defined benefit retirement and other post retirement schemes\n\nFor defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of benefits charged to the profit or loss includes current and past service costs, interest costs on defined benefit obligations and the effect of any curtailments or settlements, net of expected returns on plan assets. An asset or liability is consequently recognised in the statement of financial position based on the present value of defined obligations, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of plan assets.\n\nThe accounting policy requires management to make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit pension schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future remuneration changes, employee attrition rates, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of service of employees. In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other asset groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nGoodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately and, therefore, is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.",
