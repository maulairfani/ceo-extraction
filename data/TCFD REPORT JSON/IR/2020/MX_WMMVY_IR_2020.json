Based on this, we defined five priorities that guided our decisions throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are very proud of their efforts; thanks to their work and dedication, today more than ever we continue delivering  our  purpose  of  helping  people  to  live better.  In  addition  to  serving  our  customers,  they managed the business effectively and we were able to progress in the implementation of our strategy. In addition to the necessary protection equipment to do their jobs, those associates considered vulnerable were granted permission for paid leave of absence; two extraordinary bonuses were given to all store, club, and DC associates; we changed the payment frequency of their salary from biweekly to weekly; and we set up a medical line to assist in the health and wellness of our associates and their families.\n\nOur first priority was to support all the associates working daily in our stores, clubs, and DCs\n\n<!-- image -->",

We worked closely with our suppliers and partners, guaranteeing in-stock in our stores and clubs at the lowest prices possible. In conjunction with the Mexico City government, we created a basket with over 300 items at the lowest prices  on  the  market  and  which  we  called  Los Esenciales (Essentials), thus honoring our philosophy of Every Day Low Prices.\n\nShared Value\n\nOur supply chain remained in operation non-stop. We  reinforced  our  omnichannel  infrastructure  in logistics and technology so our customers would have their products in their homes, how they wanted to receive it, at the lowest possible price.

We also donated over 250 tons of food for more than 22,800 senior-citizen packers.\n\nThe  complications  of  the  pandemic  also  affected  our  small farmers, and therefore we decided to provide support by reducing payment terms to seven days and extending our factoring program at competitive rates. We waived rent payments for our small tenants and we worked with them in employing their personnel during demand peaks.\n\nAs our third priority, we focused on helping each other, including the communities we serve and our suppliers",

In addition, we managed to accelerate the contribution  of  eCommerce  to  total  sales  growth.  At  a  consolidated  level, excluding one-time effects, our results were positive. Revenue amounted to 701.7 billion pesos, an 8.5% increase over last year. SG&A grew 9.3%, representing 14.7% of total revenue, quite similar to 2019 levels, thanks to our operating discipline  and  in  spite  of  high  expenses  incurred  due  to  the  pandemic. Operating income grew 9.7%. EBITDA totaled 77.2 billion pesos, a margin of 11.0%, remaining in double digits like in 2019.\n\n- * To improve visibility of our business performance, we are including a retroactive estimate of the effect that the implementation of IFRS 16 would have had on 2018 financial results. These pro-forma figures are not audited, but are based on audited results reported in 2018 and were adjusted with our best estimates to show the effects related to the adoption of IFRS 16.

Therefore we did not delay our growth and we invested in technology and infrastructure, enabling us to continue building the future because we believe in the long term potential of the region.\n\nOnce restrictions for construction were lifted by the authorities, we resumed our growth plan for new stores at an even faster pace. This effort to maintain our strategy, allowed for a 1.5% contribution to total sales by the new stores.\n\nWe  expanded  our  logistics  network  with  an eCommerce Fulfillment Center in Estado de Mexico, and we opened two new omnichannel DCs, one in the city of Merida, and another one in Chihuahua, permitting us to broaden our coverage nationwide, supplying more units of all our formats. Moreover, we laid the first stone of the Villahermosa and Mexicali DCs, to continue developing our logistics strength.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  launched  the  Bodega  websites  for  both  our extended catalog and for Despensa a tu casa (Grocery Home Shopping), as well as enabling the On Demand service in 101 Bodega stores and 164 Sam's Club units that had not been planned for that year. Thanks to the progress achieved, we were able to rapidly and efficiently serve thousands of families in communities that benefited from our presence so they could remain safe without leaving home. Maintaining the strategic approach for expansion and omnichannel capabilities.\n\nIn Central America we opened 19 stores throughout the region, representing an additional 17,538 m2 of sales floor. We developed and launched an online shopping  platform,  with  which  we  enabled  200 stores to cover 60% of the territory with the presence of our Bodega, Supermarket, and Walmart formats in five countries, offering home delivery and pickup services. Also, we implemented the first store with a self-checkout system in the region, that is, Walmart Heredia  Este,  where  our  customers  can  enjoy  a renewed shopping experience.\n\nThe  year  2020  was  also  a  year  of  innovation.  We continue  to  work  focused  on  our  customers  and on  enhancing  their  experience.  We  welcomed Walmart Express, a format with efficient assortment, low prices, and a more robust omnichannel value proposition. Our prepaid mobile phone service was launched  in  Mexico,  called  BAIT,  (Bodega  Aurrera Internet and Telephone) which offers an affordable and inclusive mobile connectivity service in support of Mexican families.",

Efforts in previous years to reinforce our omnichannel capabilities have enabled us to successfully overcome the difficulties caused by the health emergency, leveraging the infrastructure built in a better way.\n\nWe have risen to the challenge of providing merchandise to our stores, thus improving productivity. We reinvented the last mile by processing merchandise in less than 24 hours. We managed a 50% reduction in the time that supplier transportation remains at the DCs. We are also reducing the time the transportation is at the store, making the merchandise flow more efficient.\n\nWe  have  adopted  digitalization  in  our  way  of  working.  For operations  visits,  a  traditional  plan  with  which  we  personally tour the DC, this year we made virtual tours for the first time. This allows for more detailed overseeing of DC operations, and the possibility of involving more company areas so they can join the  initiatives  being  implemented  and  strengthen  operations through collective expertise.\n\nTo  continue  maintaining  high  service  levels,  we invested  in  enhanced  collection  terminals  and tracking systems to obtain information on real time location and delivery of merchandise.\n\nWe continued developing future leaders in logistics; in Mexico, we promoted 1,497 associates and trained more than 19,000. In Central America, we offered the Business Project Management course for training in process  management  methodologies.  In  addition, we  established  a  strategic  alliance  with  Franklin Covey, who provided training in Six Critical Leadership Practices for, logistics manager development.\n\nDespite having solid logistics operations, we continue working on being the spearhead in supply chains.

In the beginning, this program was meant for products sold in our Bodega Aurrera stores in the Greater Mexico City area, for the aforementioned period. However, due to greater acceptance and the economic benefits produced, the program was extended to the entire year and in all our self-service formats.  In addition to this campaign, in support of students throughout Mexico  we  launched  Essential  Back-to-School Products, to maintain low prices for 60 basic items found on school lists, sold in our more than 2,000 Bodega Aurrera units nationwide for over a month and a half.  Through our joint efforts with suppliers and authorities, we were able to provide another way to maintain our promise of Every Day Low Prices, benefiting our customers and their families during these times of greatest need.\n\nThis  pandemic  has  changed  many  habits  for everyone, from the way we relate to each other, to the way we work and how we shop. By placing the customer at the center of all our decisions, we have better  understood  the  new  'normal'  for  families, and we have undertaken measures that better meet their new needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn serving these changes, at Bodega Aurrera we have reinforced the Morralla (Loose Change) campaign, which offers a series of products valued at 5 pesos and above, including Our Brands. Through this, we increased the number of items sold while enabeling our customer to obtain high-quality goods at affordable prices\n\nAnother strategy we implemented was the Ca\u00f1onazos campaign, aimed at driving higher volume products, with top-selling brands and products offered at the best possible price-value ratio, thus increasing the sale potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our customers in the region therefore obtain frictionless shopping experiences with the safety and health measures recommended for shopping in our stores.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.6%\n\neCommerce contribution to sales growth in Mexico\n\nOur  performance  has  been  consistent  and  our same-store sales growth continues to be the driving force for our primary growth. In Mexico, eCommerce contribution  to  total  sales  growth  increased  2.5 times vs. 2019. In addition, our Gross Merchandise Value grew 164%.\n\nAware that our eCommerce offerings have become very appealing to our customers, they will probably continue shopping online once the health situation returns to normal. We are on the right path. We are a resilient business, capable of adjusting to situations as they appear. This fact, together with our financial strength, will allow us to continue innovating and investing, keeping us on the road to success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However,  we  identified that  the  relationship  between  this  purchase  and consumption was not direct; therefore, a data model was made to identify the impact of the price decrease in the purchase of the refrigerant in the period from 2018 to 2020, with the purpose of correcting 2019 real consumption.\n\nAs a consequence of the results of this model, the total refrigerant emissions for 2019 were corrected, arriving at a real consumption data for that year of 829,886 tCO 2 e.

Extreme weather events, as well as human-caused damage to the environment -both related to climate change- are two of the top ten current risks listed by the World Economic Forum. They are also directly linked to three existential risks over the next ten years: biodiversity loss, natural-resource crisis and the possibility of failing climate-action strategies.\n\nThis risk implies that the potential for disruption in the value chain is much greater, as well as high impact consequences  on  the  lives  of  our  customers,  the communities where we operate, our associates, and the planet. Climate change risk is especially acute in sectors such as agriculture, as well as some others that use resources intensively, such as the manufacturing and  the  food  sectors.  Thus,  identifying  the  specific risks and opportunities arising from climate change is very important to our strategic vision for the future as a company.\n\nTo assess these risks, we first consider a broad spectrum of material issues and potential consequences related to climate change from specialized sources, investors, consultants, and international climate change organizations. Our risk identification is updated every two years, the latest being in 2019, and thus we have the possibility to link our future and strategic vision with the specific impacts for the company.\n\nAdditionally, in the case of existing risks in our supply chain, we focus on the key participants and suppliers that may have higher risk, as previously mentioned. In order to have an update on risks and opportunities and the ensuing potential financial impact, we rely on the CDP to provide visibility at the supply chain level and to understand how these key suppliers identify their risks, in what timeframe, and with what impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, 121 suppliers completed the climate change questionnaire and 61% conducted an analysis of risks and opportunities related to climate change",

To achieve this, we focused on improving our inventories and maintaining our freshness promise.\n\nIn  2020,  our  Total  Loss  started  operations,  which follows  up  on  projects  that  reduce  food  waste. The  Committee  is  made  up  of  the  Central  Ops, Merchandising, Operations, Asset Protection, Quality, Logistics,  Human  Resources,  Walmart  Foundation and  Sustainability  teams.

Through this Committee  we  promote  the  reduction  of  waste generated, beginning with our own operations, to prevent perishables from reaching landfills.\n\nOur goal is to reduce food waste generation by 50% by 2025 compared to 2015\n\n<!-- image -->",

At Bodega Aurrera in Mexico, we operate a program where we lower the price of some products  with  expiration  dates  about  to  become effective, and to inform customers that consumption must be on the same day of purchase. We also have our Fruit for Associates Program, through which we donate fruit in the store so that our associates may supplement their breakfast.\n\nThe next stage is to ally with food banks through the Walmart Mexico Foundation. This year we donated 36,131 tons of food.\n\nIn  the  case  of  food  that  is  not  fit  for  human consumption, upon being designated shrink, there are two possible uses: compost, which can be used as a soil conditioner; and livestock feed. Finally, in Central America, there are biodigestion options that biologically process waste, decomposing it into gray water and biomass to prevent its disposal in landfills.\n\nIn  2020,  we  were  able  to  prevent    57,841  waste from being sent to landfills in Mexico and Central America. In addition to reducing waste generation costs,  this  strategy  demonstrated  a  significant environmental  impact  by  eliminating  risks  of biological  contamination  due  to  decomposition, odors, liquids, and leachates, and mainly, potential greenhouse gas emissions, which have significant impact on the environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020 we reduced food waste sent to landfills by 39.6% in Mexico",

Thanks to its success, in 2019 we installed 13 machines at our stores, including our Bodega Aurrera format, and collected 38 tons of plastic.\n\nThis is due to the great collaboration we had with AlEn with the objective of contributing to the creation of a circular economy that avoids waste generation, to the design of closed material cycles, and to the reduction of the use of natural resources. Currently, 35% of the plastic that AlEn processes in its two recycling plants comes from the machines installed in our stores and at some other points.\n\nThanks to these results, they have 100% recycled PET bottles, and in their plants they manage to recycle more plastic than what is placed on the market with their products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18\n\nmachines that collected +154% vs 2019",

Through  this  campaign  we  were  able  to collect 220,713 pesos, from our customers, which was then given to CEMEFI. It was very easy to participate; all our customers had to do was donate 5 pesos or more at the cashier in any of our stores and clubs, or make donations of a minimum of 100 pesos with our online platform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We were able to expand our price gap by 50 basis points and to expand gross profit by 20 basis points for the full year.\n\nWhen  we  look  at  the  full  year,  the  team  managed  to  keep  the  operating discipline, despite the high expense environment we experienced. Excluding one-time effects, expenses as percentage of sales were quite similar to 2019 levels. Underlying 2020 results were positive.

We are independent from Wal-Mart de M\u00e9xico, S.A.B. de C.V. within the meaning of the Code of Ethics for Accounting Professionals of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) and the ethical requirements  applicable  to  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  /financial  statements  in  Mexico established by the Code of Ethics of the Mexican Institute of Public Accountants (IMCP, Spanish acronym) and have ful/filled our other responsibilities under those relevant ethical requirements and the Code of Ethics of the IESBA.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole and, in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have ful/filled the responsibilities described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated /financial statements\" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, RIGHT-OFUSE ASSETS, INVESTMENT PROPERTIES AND INTANGIBLES\n\n## Description and why it was considered a key audit matter\n\nWe have considered as a key audit matter the impairment analysis of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, investment properties and intangibles, because the determination of the recovery  value  is  complex,  it  involves  a  high  degree  of  judgment  from  the  Company's management and requires signi/ficant judgments and assumptions to be made that are a/ffected by future conditions, such as pro/fitability and economic conditions, discount rates, operating\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, the calculation of the recoverable value carries the risk that the future cash /flows used in its determination di/ffer from expectations, or that the results are di/fferent from the originally estimated values. In addition, the balances of long-lived assets subject to the determination of the recovery value for impairment tests are signi/ficant as of December 31, 2020.\n\nNotes 3 and 8 to 11 of the accompanying consolidated /financial statements include the disclosures on the impairment assessment of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, investment properties and intangibles.\n\n## How we responded to the key audit matter\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the e/ffectiveness of signi/ficant controls with respect to the impairment analysis process for long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe analyze the assumptions and hypotheses used by the Company's management for the identi/fication and grouping of long-lived assets in each cash-generating unit (CGU).\n\nWe evaluated the /financial projections of future cash /flows used by the Company's management in the impairment analysis of each CGU that we consider within our scope, verifying the information with which said projections were prepared and analyzing their consistency with historical trends and future business plans. We evaluated the composition of the CGUs and the assets  subject  to  impairment  analysis  assigned  within  each  CGU.  We  analyzed  the  key assumptions, considering the sensitivity of those assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists  to  assist  us  in  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  the  key  assumptions  and  the methodology used by the Company's Management in its impairment analysis according to International  Accounting  Standard  ('IAS')  36,  Impairment  of  assets.  We  independently recalculated  the  arithmetic  calculations  of  the  valuation  models  used  and  analyzed  the uniformity of the de/finition of CGU applied by the Company.\n\nWe obtained evidence from the impairment study prepared by the Company's management on its long-lived assets and we evaluated the competence, technical capabilities and objectivity of the management's external valuation specialist.\n\nWe also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures related to the identi/fication and determination of the recoverable value of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, investment properties and intangibles of the accompanying consolidated /financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe other information comprises the /financial and non-/financial information (other than the /financial statements and our audit report) presented in the annual report by the Company submitted to the National Banking and Securities Commission (the Commission) and in the annual report submitted to the shareholders for the year ended as at 31 December 2020. Management is responsible for the other information. We expect to obtain the other information after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated /financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information when we have access to it and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information contained in the Annual  Report  /filed  with  the  Commission  and/or  in  the  annual  report  submitted  to  the Company's shareholders, we are required to report that fact to those charged with governance and to describe the matter in our statement on the Annual Report required by the Commission.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND OF THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated /financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  /financial statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated /financial statements represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Carlos Carrillo.\n\nMancera, S.C.

This amount is recognized in the following items in the financial statements of the year ended on December 31, 2020: general expenses (VAT) of $1,813 million; financial expenses (surcharges) of $2,406 million; income tax (current tax) of $3,856 million and income tax pending to recover (balance sheet) of $4 million.\n\n## 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## a) International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") new and revised effective as of January 1, 2020\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3, 'Business Combinations'\n\nThe IASB (International Accounting Standard Board) issued amendments to the definition of a 'business' to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets needs to be considered as a business or not. The modifications must be applied to transactions that are business combinations or asset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2020. These modifications did not have impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39, 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform'\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument. These amendments have no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.\n\n## IAS 1, 'Financial statements presentation' and IAS 8, 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimations and errors'\n\nThe amendments provide a new definition of 'material' that states that 'information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those\n\nfinancial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity'. The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of the information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. These modifications have not had an impact on WALMEX 's consolidated financial statements and no future impacts are expected.\n\n## Amendments to Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\n\nThe Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained therein override  the  concepts  or  requirements  in  any  standard.  The  purpose  of  the  Conceptual Framework is to assist the IASB in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards. This will affect those entities which developed their accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16, 'Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions'\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification.\n\nThe amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Earlier application is permitted. This amendment had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## b)  IFRS issued but not yet effective\n\n## IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nThis IFRS will replace IFRS 4 that was issued in 2005. IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities\n\n<!-- image -->",

The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects.\n\nIFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17. The Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1, 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current'\n\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in criteria to classify a liability as current or non-current.\n- \u00b7 Considerations about substantial right to defer the liability settlement.\n- \u00b7 Settlement  definition  and  possibility  of  settling  liabilities  in  cash,  other  economic resources, or entity's equity instruments.\n- \u00b7 New disclosures by liabilities deferrals.\n\nClassification as current or non-current liability will not be affected by the probability that the entity exercises or not its deferral right.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and must be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice and whether existing loan agreements may require renegotiation.\n\n## Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3, 'Business Combinations'\n\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' - Reference to the Conceptual Framework. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements.\n\nThe Board also added an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 'Levies', if incurred separately.\n\nAt the same time, the Board decided to clarify existing guidance in IFRS 3 for contingent assets that would not be affected by replacing the reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and apply prospectively.\n\nThe Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use'\n\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued these amendments, which prohibits entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, directly in the income statement.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37, 'Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract'\n\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 to specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making.\n\nThe amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs\n\n<!-- image -->",

General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The Company will apply these amendments to contracts for which it has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments.\n\nThe Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIFRS annual improvements 2018-2020\n\n## IFRS 1, 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards - Subsidiary as a first-time adopter'\n\nThe amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRS. This amendment is also applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with earlier adoption permitted.\n\n## IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments - Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities'\n\nThe amendment mentions when derecognize a financial liability that has been modified or exchanged, it must be evaluated whether the terms are substantially different between the new or modified financial liability and the original financial liability. A substantial difference is considered when the present value of the discounted cash flows under the new conditions, including commissions paid net, differs at least 10 percent from the present value of discounted cash flows that still remain from the original financial liability, using for discounting, the original effective interest rate.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendments to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IAS 41, 'Agriculture - Taxation in fair value measurements'\n\nThe amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 where entities needed to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of IAS 41.\n\nAn entity applies the amendment prospectively to fair value measurements on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with earlier adoption permitted.\n\nThe Company's management estimates that these modifications will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies is described below. These policies have been applied consistently with those applied in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n## a) Basis of preparation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), including those issued previously by the former Standard Interpretations Committee (SIC).\n\nThe consolidated statements of comprehensive income were prepared based on the function of its components, which allows disclosure of cost of sales separately from other costs, operating and administrative expenses, with both expenses recognized in the statement of income at the time they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nPrior to the consolidation process, the financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are prepared under IFRS and translated to Mexican pesos using the average exchange rate for the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the year-end exchange rate for the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe cumulative translation adjustment is the effect of translating the financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries into Mexican pesos. This effect is recognized in equity.\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors and therefore, the actual results may differ from estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and mainly include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting estimates for impairment of inventory, property and equipment, right of use assets, investment properties, goodwill and the successful probability of legal and tax contingencies.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions such as discount rates used to determine leases liabilities; annually, the Company reviews the useful lives for property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives; labor obligation present value factors determined through actuarial valuations  using  economic  assumptions,  such  as  discount  rate,  inflation  rate,  salary increase rate and minimum salary increase rate; and determination of the recoverable value involving significant judgments such as future cash flows, the discount rate and the interest rate; fair value of derivative financial instruments and investment properties.\n\nWALMEX has sufficient resources to continue operating as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis and on a historical-cost basis, except for financial assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which are fair valued as of the end of every period. The Mexican peso is the Company's functional and reporting currency.\n\n## b) Consolidation\n\nThe  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  financial  statements  of WALMEX , entities in which the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary and those of its Mexican and foreign subsidiaries or investee in which has control, which are grouped as\n\ndescribed in Note 1, and prepared considering the same accounting period. Subsidiaries or investees are consolidated from the date on which control is assumed by WALMEX , and until such control is lost. The results of subsidiaries or investee acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, the Company controls an investee if, and only if, the Company has:\n\n- \u00b7 Power over the investee (i.e. the existing rights that give it the current ability to conduct the relevant activities of the investee),\n- \u00b7 Exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its participation in the investee.\n- \u00b7 The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\n\nTransactions and related party balances are eliminated in the consolidation.\n\nThe Company consolidates in its financial statements the balances and operations of the investees Cargill Protein S. de R.L. de C.V. and Cargill Protein Servicios S. de R.L. de C.V., according to the agreement established with them to provide services for meat processing, through which the Company obtains control solely and exclusively from the accounting point of view and applying accounting principles but not legal ones, through the right to variable returns for its participation in these entities. Net income for the consolidated period considers a remaining attributable to the results of the investees of $(39,343) in 2020 and $(12,797) in 2019; and the statement of financial position contains a remaining attributable to the minority interest of the investees of $(52,139) and $(16,289), respectively.\n\n## c) Financial assets and liabilities and fair value measurement\n\nThe Company determines the classification of financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition as described below:\n\n- I. Financial assets. These assets are classified in one of the following categories, as required: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, accounts receivable, investments held to maturity. The Company's financial assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other accounts receivable which are initially recognized at fair value. Fair value of an asset is the price in which such asset would be sold in an ordinary transaction with third parties, capable of participating in the transaction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n- II. Financial liabilities. These liabilities are classified in accounts payable, other accounts payable and lease liabilities; these liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently valued to amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The liabilities from derivatives are recognized initially and subsequently at fair value. Fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the responsibility to a new creditor in an ordinary transaction among those parties.\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\nLevel 1. Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\n\nLevel 2. Other valuations including quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable, and;\n\nLevel 3. Unobservable data inputs, for which the Company develops its own assumptions and valuations.\n\nSubsequent measurement of the Company's financial assets and liabilities is determined based on their classification.\n\nThe Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## d) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents principally consist of bank deposits, credit and debit card transfer transactions that process in less than seven days, and highly liquid investments with maturities of less than 90 days, plus accrued interest. Cash is stated at fair value.\n\nCash that is restricted and cannot be exchanged or used to settle a liability for a minimum period of twelve months is presented in a separate line item in the statement of financial position and is excluded from cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.\n\n## e) Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company has entered into currency hedging through Over the Counter (OTC) currency forward transactions (Fx-forwards) to mitigate the effects caused by variability in the exchange\n\nrate of foreign currency on its accounts payable related to import goods for sale. The maximum length of these contracts is six months.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contract is subscribed and subsequently revalued at fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized immediately as a part of the financial income (expense) line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIn accordance with our standards of corporate governance, the Company manages only Fxforwards as derivative financial instruments.\n\n## f) Accounts receivable and provision for impairment of other accounts receivable\n\nWALMEX recognizes the impairment of its receivables by applying the simplified approach allowed by IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\", recognizing the expected credit losses as of the creation of the account receivable. These assets are grouped according to the characteristics of credit risk and the days past due, with the expected loss provision for each risk group determined based on the historical credit loss and experience of the Company, adjusted for specific factors for debtors and effects in the economic environment.\n\n## g) Inventories\n\nInventories are valued using the retail method, except for merchandise for Sam's Club, distribution centers, Agro-Industrial development (grains, edibles and meat) and perishable divisions, which are stated using the weighted average cost method. These methods are consistent with those applied in the prior year. Inventories, including obsolete, slow-moving and defective items or items in poor condition, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\n\nFreight and buying allowances are capitalized in inventory and are recognized in the cost of sales based on the turnover of the inventories that gave rise to them.\n\n## h) Prepaid expenses\n\nPrepaid expenses are recorded at cost and recognized as current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position as of the date the prepayments are made. Once the goods or services related to the prepayments are received, they should be charged to the income statement or capitalized in the corresponding asset line when there is certainty that the acquired goods will generate future economic benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## i) Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost and are presented net of accumulated depreciation.\n\nDepreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates:\n\nBuildings, facilities and leasehold improvements:\n\n| \u00b7  Constructions and structures   | 2.5% to   | 5.0%   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| \u00b7  Facilities and adaptations     | 5.0% to   | 12.5%  |\n| \u00b7  Construction /finishes         | 10.0% to  | 25.0%  |\n| Furniture and equipment           | 5.0% to   | 33.3%  |\n| Computer equipment                | 12.5% to  | 33.3%  |\n| Transportation equipment          | 10.0% to  | 33.3%  |\n\nConstruction in progress mostly consists of investments made by the Company, mainly for the construction of new stores and improvements; they are recognized at cost, and once complete, the Company reclassifies work in process to property and the depreciation begins.\n\n## j) Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties consist of land, buildings and constructions and facilities in properties that are leased to others and are maintained to obtain economic benefits through the collection of rent. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. After initial recognition, they continue to be valued at cost less depreciation and accumulated losses due to impairment.\n\nDepreciation of investment properties is computed on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates:\n\nBuildings, facilities and leasehold improvements:\n\n- \u2022 Constructions and structures\n\n2.5% to\n\n5.0%\n\n- \u2022 Facilities and adaptations\n\n5.0% to\n\n12.5%\n\n- \u2022 Finishes of construction\n\n10.0% to\n\n25.0%\n\n## k) Leases\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the exercises of judgement about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether the Company obtains substantially all the economics benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the assets.\n\n## WALMEX as a lessee\n\nWALMEX recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the rightof-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using incremental interest rate of WALMEX .\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. These liabilities are re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if WALMEX changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fixed and variable rental income is recognized when accrued, and such revenues are presented as a part of other revenues line within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## l) Impairment of long term definite useful life assets\n\nThe long-term definite useful life assets are subject to impairment tests only when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\nThe Company recognizes impairment in the value of this type of assets by applying the expected present value technique to determine value in use, considering each store as the minimum cash-generating unit.\n\nThe  present  value  technique  requires  detailed  budget  calculations,  which  are  prepared separately for each cash-generating unit where the assets are located. These budgets generally cover five years and, in case of a longer period, an expected growth rate is applied.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a part of other expenses.\n\nWhen an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased by the reviewed estimate of the recoverable amount, not exceeding the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the comprehensive income statement.\n\n## m) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recognized  when  they  have  the  following  characteristics:  they  are identifiable, they give rise to future economic benefits and the Company has control over such benefits.\n\nIntangible assets are valued at the lower of acquisition cost or fair value at the acquisition date and are classified based on their useful lives, which may be definite or indefinite. Indefinitelived assets are not amortized; however, they are subject to annual impairment tests. Definitelived assets are amortized using the straight-line method at rates between 7.7% and 33.3%.\n\n## n) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of Walmart Central America at the acquisition date and is not subject to amortization.\n\nGoodwill was assigned applying the perpetuity value technique to determine the goodwill's value in use, considering each Central American country (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) as a minimum cash generating unit.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually. The Company engages the services of an independent expert to test its goodwill for impairment. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of value of money over time and the specific risks affecting such assets.\n\nFuture cash flows consider the business plan and projections used by management in its decision making for the following five years.\n\nGoodwill is translated at the closing exchange rate and such translation is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## o) Liabilities and provisions\n\nAccrued liabilities represent current obligations (legal or assumed) for past events where an outflow of economic resources is possible and can be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements are recognized net of any related obligation when it is certain that the reimbursement will be obtained. Provision expenses are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income net of any corresponding reimbursements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## p) Income taxes\n\n## Current and deferred income\n\nIncome taxes are classified as current and deferred and are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year they are expensed or accrued, except when they come from items directly recognized in other comprehensive income, in which case, the corresponding taxes are recognized in equity.\n\nCurrent income taxes are determined based on the tax laws approved in the countries where WALMEX has operations and are the result of applying the applicable tax rates at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the taxable profits of each entity of the Group. Current income taxes are presented as a current liability/asset net of prepayments made during the year.\n\nDeferred income taxes result from applying the applicable enacted or substantively enacted income tax rate at the reporting date to all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are only recognized when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the deductions for temporary differences can be taken. The deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred assets to be used. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nThe deferred income tax on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries is recognized, unless the period of reversal of temporary differences is controlled by WALMEX and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the near future.\n\nThe Company offsets tax assets and liabilities only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to income taxes that pertain to the same authority.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Company reviews its criteria for the recognition and measurement of income taxes when there are uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions are those tax positions where there is uncertainty about whether the competent tax authority of each of the countries where WALMEX operates will accept the tax position under current tax laws.\n\nIf the Company concludes that a particular tax treatment is likely to be accepted, it determines the taxable profit (tax loss), tax basis, unused tax losses, unused tax credits, or tax rates consistent with the tax treatment included in its tax return. If the Company concludes that a particular tax treatment is unlikely to be accepted, the entity uses the most probable amount or expected value of the tax treatment that the authority would accept when determining the tax profit (tax loss), tax basis, non-tax losses used, unused tax credits or tax rates.\n\n## q) Employee benefits\n\nEmployees in Mexico are entitled to a seniority premium in accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law. Also, WALMEX employees in each of the six countries are entitled to termination benefits to be paid in accordance with each country's respective labor laws. These employee benefits are recognized as expenses during the years in which services are rendered, based on actuarial computations performed by independent experts using the projected unit credit method.\n\nIn Mexico, the seniority premium is granted to employees who retire from the Company with a minimum of fifteen years of seniority. The amount paid to the associate is equivalent to twelve days for each year worked, without exceeding the amount for each day of twice the minimum wage. The Company has set up a defined benefits trust fund to cover seniority premiums accruing to employees. Employees make no contributions to this fund.\n\nIn Central America, the termination benefits for associates are paid when required in the case of unjustified dismissal or death, in accordance with the Labor Law of each country where the Company operates. The benefits range from 20 days to one month of salary for each year of uninterrupted service.\n\nAll other payments to which employees or their beneficiaries are entitled in the event of involuntary retirement or death are expensed as incurred, in accordance with the federal labor laws of each country.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The corresponding accrual is recognized as a decrease in stockholders' equity directly.\n\nEmployee stock option plan fund and stock option compensation:\n\nThe employee stock option plan fund is comprised of WALMEX shares which are acquired in the secondary market and are presented at acquisition cost. The plan is designed to grant stock options to executives of the companies of the Group, as approved by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission.\n\nThe shares subject to the plan are assigned, taking as a reference the weighted average price of the purchase and sale transactions in the secondary market of such shares.\n\nThe current policy has two grant plans to executives; the first one grant stock options and the second one grant restricted shares (the last one is offered only to certain executive levels). In the stock option plan, the term to exercise the option is released in four years in two equal parts: 50% in two years and the remaining 50% by the end of the fourth year. The term to exercise the rights is 10 years from the grant date.\n\nThe vesting period for the restricted shares plan is 3 years and the term to exercise the option is up to 10 years starting from the date of the assignment. The amount of the restricted shares is\n\nsubject to compliance with certain metrics that are evaluated for assignment after the first year, which may cause the original allocation to decrease or increase within a range of 0% to 150%\n\nAccording to the previous policy, WALMEX executives may exercise their option to acquire shares in equal parts over five years. The right to exercise the employee stock option expired after ten years as of the grant date or after sixty days following the date of the employee's termination and there was no restricted share plan.\n\nThe compensation cost of stock options is recognized in general expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at fair value.\n\nPremium on sale of shares:\n\nThe premium on sale of shares represents the difference between the cost of shares and the value at which such shares were sold, net of the corresponding income tax.\n\n## s) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  from  merchandise  sales,  including  online  sales  (\"e-Commerce\")  is  recognized  in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at the time the obligation is satisfied (when \"control\" of the goods has been transferred to the customer). Revenue from services is recognized at the time the service is provided.\n\nExtended warranties, service commissions and cell phone airtime are recognized net in the net sales line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at time the service is provided.\n\nSam's Club membership income is deferred over the twelve-month term of the membership and presented in the other revenue line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nRental income is recognized as it accrues over the terms of the lease agreements entered with third parties and presented in the other revenue line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nRevenues from the sale of waste and parking lots are recognized in other revenue line at the time the property is transferred upon delivery of the goods or at the time the services are provided.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share since there is currently no potentially dilutive common stock.\n\nThe effect on earnings per share, which represents the remainder attributable to the results of the investees in 2020 and 2019 is of $0.002 and $0.001 pesos per share, respectively.\n\n## u) Operating segments\n\nSegment financial information is prepared based on the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker \"CODM\" to make business decisions and assess the Company's performance. Segment information is presented based on the geographical zones in which the Company operates.\n\n## v) Foreign currency transactions\n\nThe  Company's  foreign  currency  denominated  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  to  the functional currency at the prevailing exchange rate at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position. Exchange differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the financial income (expenses) lines.\n\n## 4. RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## a) General risk factors\n\nThe Company is exposed to the effects of future events that could affect the purchasing power and/or buying habits of the population. These events may be economic, political or social in nature and some of the most important are described below:\n\n- I. Changes in exchange rates. Exchange rate fluctuations tend to put upward pressure on inflation and reduce the population's purchasing power, which could ultimately adversely affect the Company's sales, in particular due to the purchase of imported goods.\n- II. Competition. The retail sector has become very competitive in recent years, which has led to the need for all the players in the market to constantly look for ways to set\n\nthemselves apart from the competition. This puts the Company's market share at risk. Other factors affecting the Company's market share could be the business expansion of its competitors and the possible entrance of new competitors into the market.\n\n- III. Inflation. A significant increase in inflation rates could have a direct effect on the purchasing power of the Company's customers and the demand for its products and services, as well as employment and salaries.\n- IV. Changes in government regulations. The Company is exposed to the changes in different laws and regulations, which, after becoming effective, could affect the Company's operating results, such as an impact on sales, expenses for payroll indirect taxes and changes in applicable rates. Currently, the level of scrutiny and discretion by the tax authorities has greatly increased. Mexican legal courts have changed their position favoring the authorities and ignoring violations of form and procedure.\n- V. Recent developments. During 2020, there have been events at the international and national level that have had an impact on the volatility of economic and market indicators as Mexico as well as Central America.\n\nThese  events  in  Mexico  and  Central  America  are  derived  from  the  contingency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the decrease in oil prices. This has led to a depreciation of the Mexican peso, limitations in the people mobility, loss of jobs and consequently a reduction in their capacity to generate income; increase in operating expenses due to additional support to associates and several health and safety measures; as well as higher risk of recovery of accounts receivable (mainly related to rents from tenants).\n\nAt the date of this report, the financial effect of the combination of these events did not have a significant adverse impact on the financial statements taken as a whole.\n\n## b) Financial risk factors\n\nThe Company's activities are exposed to various financial risks such as exchange rate, interest rate and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Company manages those risks that impede or endanger its financial objectives, seeking to minimize potential negative effects through different strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(See Note 3 \"Summary of significant accounting policies - Financial assets and liabilities and fair value measurement\").\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has Fx-forward contracts with a term of no more than four months recorded in other accounts payable, which are shown below:\n\n|                                             | 2020   | 2020     | 2019   | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|\n| Current contracts                           |        | 281      |        | 292      |\n| Notional amount (millions of USD)           | US$    | 163.83   | US$    | 167.30   |\n| Notional amount (millions of Mexican Pesos) | MXN$   | 3,357.56 | MXN$   | 3,247.20 |\n| Fair value, net (millions of pesos)         | MXN$ ( | 82.19)   | MXN$ ( | 55.90)   |\n\nEach Fx-forwards operation contracted with the banking institutions is agreed by means of a confirmation letter and consists in the exchange in kind of currencies with the same counterpart that occurs simultaneously at the settlement date agreed in the confirmation letter.\n\n## Interest rate risk:\n\nThe Company has temporary investments in government paper which generate financial income. By reducing the interest rate, the financial income of the Company also decreases. The interest rate of these investments fluctuated during the year 2020 between 1.60% and 7.42%. As of December 31, 2020, the financial income amounted to $986,291 ($1,218,688 in 2019).\n\nConsidering the highly liquid instruments as of December 31, 2020, if there was an increase or decrease in the interest rate of 0.50%, there would be a favorable or unfavorable effect on the financial income of the Company of $98,348.\n\n## Liquidity risk:\n\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risks to meet its payment obligations to suppliers, payment of taxes, acquisitions of fixed assets and other working capital requirements, which are settled through the cash flow generated in the operation. For this reason, in order to avoid the breach of its obligations, the Company has contracted lines of credit and overdraft with different Banks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the credit and overdraft lines contracted and no used amounted $41,001 million that give additional liquidity to that generated by the operating activities, if it is necessary.\n\n## 5.

Annual rental income before expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was reduced by 24% from the previous year mainly due to the contingency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; On the other hand, the capitalization rates used for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were 8.5% in both periods. E/ffects on annual income and the update of the capitalization rate were considered in the calculation of the estimated fair value.\n\nThe Company's Management determined that there is no impairment in the investment properties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The estimated fair value of the investment properties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is $ 7,011,501 and $ 9,238,994, respectively. The Company compares the estimated fair value and the net book value to determine if there are impairment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zero Waste: To calculate total space avoided in  landfill, we use an estimated value based on a volumetric weight factor of 91.13 kg/m3. The factor  is calculated based on an exercise of characterizing wastes and quartering in 91 sites in five regions,  completed in October 2020. In Central America, 49.62% of total weight of non-hazardous waste  (equivalent to 44,709 Tons) is estimated based on a factor stemming from operational shrink.  Zero Waste: To calculate total space avoided in landfill, we use an estimated value considering only  total weights of recovered plastic materials (of all types) and materials made with pulp (paper and  board) based on the following estimations: a.

We carry out our work based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\", issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, that standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, based on our work and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Contents included in the 2020 Financial and ESG Report for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020, are not prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB').\n\nKPMG  CARDENAS  DOSAL  S.C.  (the  'Firm')  applies  International  Standard  on  Quality  Control  1  and  accordingly  maintains  a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nThe procedures selected depend on our knowledge and experience of the Contents presented in the 2020 Financial and ESG Report and other circumstances of the work, and our consideration of the areas in which material errors may occur.\n\nWhen obtaining an understanding of the Contents included in the 2020 Financial and ESG Report, and other work circumstances, we have considered the processes used to prepare the Contents, in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion as to the effectiveness of Walmart's internal control over the preparation and presentation of the Contents included in the 2020 Financial Report and ESG.\n\n(Continue)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our engagement is not designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report, as the engagement has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the procedures performed were undertaken on a test basis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur conclusion has been formed based on, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\n(Continue)\n\n<!-- image -->",
