No one back then could have foreseen the emergence of cOVId-19 and the disruption it would cause across the globe. As of this writing, the virus has claimed over 2.6 million lives globally and caused the global economy to shrink by four percent year over year, demonstrating the vulnerability of our increasingly interconnected world. Almost no industry was spared. unlike previous crises, which tended to affect certain sectors disappropriately, it was a rare business that did not have to contend with the pandemic's economic, human, and technological impact. In addition, across the global manufacturing sector, the industry continued to face several pre-existing headwinds, such as tightening supply chains, intensified competition, and geopolitical conflicts.",

        "page_content": "It was against this unprecedented economic backdrop that ImI proved its resiliency. The company felt the impact of cOVId-19 almost immediately. The factories in china cut back dramatically on production through January as the health issues reached crisis proportions. ImI faced varying levels of disruption in all operating sites across the globe. From the united Kingdom, to serbia, to Japan, and to its global headquarters in the Philippines, the company's financial, operational, and technological strengths were put to the test.\n\nDespite these remarkable challenges, IMI finished 2020 in a better financial position than the previous year, all while retaining its position as a top 20 electronics manufacturing solutions provider and achieving several key milestones that underscored the company's operational flexibility and innovative approach. Business performance recovered strongly in the second half as global manufacturing demand returned close to pre-pandemic levels. ImI deployed\n\nits global footprint and suite of capabilities to help mitigate the human and economic impact of the pandemic by leveraging its expertise in high reliability manufacturing to provide leading edge medical technology solutions. Among these products is a commercialized non-invasive ventilator for cOVId-19 patients. A key subsidiary, VIA optronics, also successfully went public in the third quarter of 2020, helping validate ImI's strategy of creating proprietary platforms to help it remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven world. And as the core manufacturing platform of Ac Industrials, ImI provided a strong base for the group's other portfolio companies, in particular the KTm joint venture and our merlin solar startup, to continue to develop and grow through the pandemic.\n\nAs IMI embarks on its fifth decade of operations, allow me to offer a few key reflections as we look ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirst, the relative swiftness of the recovery in global manufacturing, versus other sectors, has illustrated how well organized, globally competitive platforms in the industry can add diversity and economic value to individual business groups and to economies.\n\nsecond, the uncertainty that permeates the medium term, as the health issues start to be addressed, requires continued prudence as we seek to preserve our gains.\n\nThird, as we gradually move into the new normal, we will continue to rebuild our manufacturing capabilities while remaining aligned with the longterm megatrends of mobility, connectivity, and smart energy that hold the key to the company's growth and global competitiveness.\n\n2020 was not an easy year-for ImI, the Ayala group, and the Philippine and global economy. We are eager to move forward and capitalize on the opportunities that have appeared as a result of this economic upheaval. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our over 15,000 employees worldwide for their commitment, openness, and collaboration, and to our broader stakeholder community for the trust you continue to show in ImI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJaime Augusto zobel de Ayala\n\nCHaIRMan\n\nAnd finally, this 'reset' now offers a fresh opportunity to accelerate ImI's ongoing initiatives to integrate sustainability into the fabric of our strategy, operations, and institutional culture.",

By the end of the year, the global GdP contracted by 3.5 percent with hopes of an upswing recovery in 2021 hinged on the rollout of vaccines.\n\nIn the context of manufacturing, based on the JPmorgan Global manufacturing PmI (Purchasing manager's Index) compiled by IHs markit, global output was on a deep contraction mode between February and June when most regions were in heavy lockdowns. The steepest decline was in may with a global index of 39.6. By the third quarter, business activities started to pick up and by the end of december, the index was at 53.8, already in expansion territory. This was also reflected in the global industrial production output which fell by more than 15 basis points in the second quarter, but was able to recover by december to almost the same levels before the pandemic started.\n\nIn the same way, worldwide semiconductor sales rebounded in the second half of the year and finished\n\nthe year higher by 6.5 percent to us$439 billion according to semiconductor Industry Association. As more employees shifted to work from home and students moved to online classes, the demand for consumer electronics and cloud computing services has surged after six years of decline and despite the negative growth that most economies experienced during the year. Specifically, global shipments of traditional Pcs, including desktops, notebooks, and workstations, grew 13.1 percent year-on-year to 302.6 million units according to International data corporation. This increase in the computing sector balanced the market declines in automotive, consumer, and telecommunications. Growth in the electronics manufacturing services (Ems) industry was estimated to be flat in 2020.\n\nThe automotive sector was one of the largest sectors affected by the pandemic with automotive light vehicle unit sales falling by more than 22 percent in the first half. By the third quarter, global sales began to recover, led by china which already exceeded their pre-pandemic demand. The year ended with a global unit sales decrease of 14 percent compared with the previous year with an ongoing recovery that is estimated to be at 8 percent in 2021.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) tell a different story. Global EV sales rose 43 percent to reach 3.24 million units for the first time, and their global market share increased to 4.2 percent in 2020 from 2.5 percent in 2019. Plug-in hybrid and EV accounted for more than 1 in 10 vehicle registrations in 2020, up from 1 in 30 in 2019. consumer demands for EVs were further propped up by the need to be safe and protected while being conscious of the environment.\n\nIn other related markets, IT spending and consumer electronics fell by 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, as global retail sales dropped by 3 percent. There were also upsides in the market such as global E-commerce which went up by 27.6 percent. semiconductors were also up 6.5 percent buoyed by more electrification in automotive, electric vehicle charging, bedside telemetry, remote health monitoring, and smart home networks.\n\nEV charging station\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe demand for medical devices continues to increase, but the manufacturing of medical device units declined by 4.4 percent in 2020 as supply chains across all regions were hampered by the lockdowns and protocol changes in shipments. Ventilators are among the only few that experienced an increase in production as governments allocated resources and funding for immediate deployment.\n\n## Consumer demand for EVs were further propped up by the need to be safe and protected while being conscious of the environment.\n\nIn the energy sector, electricity generated from wind and solar sources has doubled over the last five years coinciding with a steady decrease in global coal production. china continues to be the world's leader in coal production and power but also leads the world in new renewable power installations. In 2020, the demand for electricity from renewable sources went up by 3 percent. Almost 90 percent of new electricity generation in 2020 will be renewable, with just 10 percent powered by gas and coal. The trend puts green electricity on track to become the largest power source in 2025, displacing coal, which has dominated for the past 50 years. In particular, solar photovoltaic is now the cheapest source of electricity in most countries.\n\nAutomotive solar photovoltaic system\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through a strategic move to diversify within ImI target segments, project wins in the industrial segment now take up a 39 percent share of total annual revenue potential, up from 22 percent in 2019. meanwhile, sTI Ltd. overcame the continued uncertainty of the Brexit situation and won new manufacturing programs worth us$118 million of total project revenues.\n\n## bUsIness ReVIew:\n\n## CoMInG oUT sTRonGeR anD beTTeR eQUIPPeD\n\nAs the cOVId-19 pandemic unfolded with much uncertainty, we implemented an organizational transformation at the start of 2019  to address the fast-changing dynamics in the market and continue delivering value to our stakeholders. Among the initiatives outlined, ImI institutionalized global key functions such as Technology (cTO), Operations (cOO), Procurement (cPO), and commercial (ccO). This also coincided with the expansion of the core support groups' scope in the areas of finance, human resources, and information and communications technology. These efforts were crucial in helping ImI face an already challenging year, enabling the group to come out stronger and better equipped to succeed in today's new normal, at the cusp of the age of disruption.\n\n## ManaGInG effICIenT oPeRaTIons\n\nWith reduced market demand in key sectors like automotive, coupled with government mandated lockdowns in china, the Philippines, and mexico, as well as shutdowns in Europe, the company's facilities experienced considerable dips in manufacturing activity. To mitigate these constraints, ImI's regional management teams secured various employeerelated government subsidies, thereby reducing operating costs while implementing global cost saving initiatives. Furthermore, our domestic production offices closely worked with local government units to allow production for essential business lines in medical, connectivity, and mobility segments.\n\nEven during difficult situations, overall quality and ontime delivery remain paramount to ImI. manufacturing performance metrics across ImI's 21 production sites were monitored daily and managed by the global Industrial Excellence group providing management a real-time window for critical and predictive decisions that drive efficiency and profitability.\n\nTo seamlessly manage operational compliance to quality standards and directly monitor key statistics, corporate Quality was integrated into the global operations group. In 2020, critical metrics such as global IPB (Incidents Per Billion) have improved\n\nwith a 74 percent reduction from previous year, while cONQ (cost of Non-Quality) and csAT (customer satisfaction) were within global targets at 1.01 % (target: <1.2 %) and csAT rating 4.53 (target: 4.50), respectively. These improvements can be attributed to the continued implementation of the Quick Reaction Quality control (QRQc) discipline a proactive risk-based thinking that aims to achieve zero-defect mindset.\n\nWith the aim to pursue digitalization of processes within the manufacturing operations, ImI's Global manufacturing solutions (Gms) group was established. The group spearheads the Industry 4.0 initiatives across all factories to provide speed, control, and visibility through a smart platform that delivers configurable dashboards. Discrete manufacturing data is fed to the dashboards showing real-time key performance indicators accessible on mobile interfaces. Through this platform, ImI team members across the globe are able to remotely contribute to maintaining the company's principle of LEAN manufacturing across all facilities.\n\nIMI Mexico\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nevertheless, the group took advantage of the available time and resources to drive more value through programs and initiatives involving new tools, and process redesigns through training and upskilling.\n\nThe company's commercial group is composed of all the regional sales directors and heads of major business units. It was established with a balanced portfolio tapping on horizontal markets for mobility and industrial, and vertical markets for the power module and camera businesses. Apart from shifting sales focus to higher margin segments, part of the strategy was to also achieve shorter gestation periods for revenue generation and to focus on more box build and system assemblies. The group also optimized and expanded the businesses with its key customers through account sharing and key account management to tap regional and global opportunities.\n\nRe-calibrating supply chain strategies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong the key programs implemented by the group are the contract life management program which automates and streamlines contract processes during key stages, enhancement of pipeline deals information report, and improved request for quotation (RFQ) process.\n\nThe continuous effort of the group to expand ImI's customer base resulted to new program wins totaling us$234 million of annual revenue potential from a total of 876 request for quotations. The won business portfolio remains dominated by the mobility segment, taking 55 percent on the total pie. In line with ImI's\n\ninitiative of diversifying within key focus segments, programs in the industrial segment have reached 39 percent of total wins, significantly greater than 2019's level of 22 percent.\n\n## Re-CalIbRaTInG oUR sUPPlY CHaIn sTRaTeGIes\n\ncOVId-19 proved to be a disruptive catalyst for many global organizations like ImI to reassess global supply chain strategies. With the rapid turn of events, we responded to immediate challenges as they happened, while initiating strategic plans to adopt digital supply network models and capabilities. Throughout the year, we endeavored to make our supply chain more resilient without sacrificing competitiveness. We mapped the full extent of our supply network and identified both direct and indirect sources. We addressed vulnerabilities by rallying our suppliers and stockpiling essential materials.\n\nTowards the end of 2020, as the automotive sector moved towards a sharp rebound, we started to feel the impact of a global component shortage particularly with automotive integrated circuits. Based on the ongoing trend, the supply levels are expected to remain critical in the first half of 2021. Our strategy is to plan production based on available key parts and to strengthen our supply reach to ensure delivery of confirmed quantities. We also continuously maintain close communication with customers and suppliers to warrant planned allocations.\n\n## PRoVIDInG TeCHnoloGY anD PlaTfoRM solUTIons\n\ndespite a challenging year, the technology group streamlined its focus to be more accessible to customers and continued to provide innovation and product solutions across all customer-focused units.\n\nWithin our mobility segment, we supplied key product solutions for critical and environmentally focused systems including pump electronic control units (Ecus), motor controls as well as full telemetry systems utilizing an internally developed platform that provides automotive grade traceability and system monitoring for vehicles. Our us teams achieved strong development wins and delivered complex electronics, including smart motor sensors, medical devices as well as new technologies for the growing EV market.\n\nOur progress in the Internet of Things (IoT) has been extensive with increasing platform solutions we\n\ncontinue to develop while offering a fast response to customer projects.

The systems provide critical vision solutions, including surround-View, E-mirrors, AdAs, driver monitoring, as well as a technical platform for LidAR and future segment requirements within the camera and vision technologies.\n\nWith the growth in vehicle electrification and power needs across multiple segments, our power module business carried on to provide high-reliability modules and solutions, while our technology group focused on ensuring that our service offering and capabilities are aligned to provide the new technology requirements in this sector.\n\nmoving forward, the team will continue to provide exceptional service offerings to our customers across all our segments. We will ensure that our platforms and technology capabilities are at the leading edge of our customer journeys to provide a true collaborative offering.\n\n## unlOCkIng the Value OF dIgItalIZatIOn\n\nBefore the pandemic, ImI had already outlined its plan to undertake a digital transformation journey. It involved a three-fold scalable plan: digitization, digitalization, and digital Transformation. The pace of implementation was effectively hastened when cOVId-19 disrupted business and manufacturing activities.\n\nThe company's Information and communications Technology (IcT) division had the responsibility of the overall vision of ImI's digital transformation with collaborative help from all the global support groups. The plan focused on building a robust infrastructure to support a broad range of new demands while keeping in mind key strategic priorities-business productivity, infrastructure optimization, security and compliance, and a mature IcT community.\n\nTo ensure business productivity, we refined our business continuity plans (BcP) and maintained safety in our manufacturing sites through development of manpower monitoring, contact tracing system, health declaration system, and other directives. most notably, we built a trusted ecosystem for all our online platforms to facilitate remote work arrangements.\n\nAt the same time, we eliminated inefficiencies and redundancies, simplified processes, and managed information more proficiently. We continually improved the company's enterprise resource systems and benchmarked traceability systems and 'Pokayoke' (mistake proofing) across all sites.\n\nAutomotive sensors\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through accurate forecasting and judicious target-setting, IMI's finance group was able to drive cost rationalization measures and effective cashflow management that preserved the company's financial strength. Regional finance teams also prioritized staff welfare by coordinating with local government units to secure various forms of employee-related subsidies in Bulgaria, china, czech Republic, France, mexico, serbia, and singapore.\n\nmoving forward, the team seeks to accelerate digital transformation to simplify processes, improve efficiency, and increase business value. Among the key activities in 2020 were the successful roll out of a cloud-based consolidation software, implementation of host-to-host payment systems, and other paperless processes to improve efficiency.\n\n## CollaboRaTInG foR UnITY anD aCTIon\n\nFrom the onset of the pandemic in February, our priorities were clearly established to get through the crisis: to protect our employees' health and safety, to ensure business continuity, and to support our partners and the community around us.\n\nTo protect our employees' physical health and financial security in this period of heightened uncertainty, we focused on monitoring our\n\nIMI Philippines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees' health and implemented measures across the different sites. ImI deployed various instruments for financial support to employees such as advancing 13th month pay, advance use of paid leave credits and hazard fee for the onsite skeleton workforce.\n\nTo ensure business continuity, onsite accommodation and transportation for ImI's skeleton workforces were arranged in many of our sites. We shifted our focus and resources to manufacture components for essential and critical products to fight COVID-19. These not only allowed ImI to resume some level of operations but also helped with the overall efforts to overcome this global pandemic.\n\nTo ensure safety of our employees onsite and on work-from-home arrangements, we implemented virtual solutions and enhanced our services through implementation of medical tele-consultations, ImI chatbot, canteen cashless payment system, online separation system, among others.\n\nTo further hone and enhance the skills of all employees specially during the pandemic, ImI, through the Learning & development (L&d) group, organized different initiatives and programs, optimizing the use of the company's Learning management system (Lms) to overcome the limitations of operating without physical and social interactions. different courses and modules were created and offered to the employees through the online E-Learning portal and other platforms to ensure that employees remain competent, welltrained, and skilled in their respective processes.\n\nTo further support our partners and the communities around us, the spirit of volunteerism was kept alive and well with employees extending their time\n\nand financial resources to aid the most vulnerable sectors of society. Other programs in the areas of self-reliance and mental health were also conducted ensuring that employees and their families are provided support in these challenging times.\n\nOverall coordination, enhanced cooperation, and unity proved to be crucial in overcoming the crisis not only in terms of our collaboration as a company but also with the private and public sectors. With a culture of purposeful unity and action in mind, we intend to continue these partnerships even beyond this crisis while holding true to our core values of integrity, excellence, customer focus and concern for others.\n\n## StI limited (uk)\n\nThe aerospace and defense (A&d) segment of ImI is fully within sTI Limited (sTI Ltd.).

Indeed, our ability to rapidly understand and adjust strategies, and seek new opportunities has never been more critical and consequential than it is today.\n\n## rISk management pOlICy\n\nOur Enterprise Risk management (ERm) Policy establishes the overall direction of the company's risk management processes and practices. Guided by ISO 31000 risk management principles, IMI defines a common, structured approach that governs the risk management process towards value creation and protection, helps improve performance, encourages innovation, and supports the achievement of objectives.\n\n## rISk management FramewOrk\n\nAcross the organization, our risk management framework and internal control systems reflect our deep commitment to integrity, transparency, and good governance for sustainable and resilient operations. This clear set of standards takes into account the company's size, risk profile, and complexity/diversity of operations to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our approach. moreover, it is also embodied in ImI's management oversight, and control culture and activities that help\n\nidentify, evaluate, mitigate, and monitor key risk exposures.\n\nIn 2020, to further improve our risk management framework and strategy, we began working on upgrading our legacy ERm intranet site which served as a key channel for communicating risk management programs, into a more robust enterprise governance software platform that creates a stronger security, risk management, compliance, and assurance system.\n\n## rISk repOrtIng\n\nIMI has well-defined reporting lines that set out accountability and ownership in every level of the organization as well as focus on quality that promotes risk-based thinking in all processes at all levels. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for regular internal reporting on the implementation of the ERm framework, its effectiveness, and outcomes. The cRO reports to our Audit and Risk committee and is being supported by the ERm leader who communicates with site risk owners and appointed risk leads on the programs, activities, and initiatives that will strengthen the risk engagement framework. Our Audit and Risk committee, in turn, ensures that we have an effective and comprehensive risk management framework and internal control systems. The committee discusses critical risks, their nature, likelihood and impact, and the management's risk mitigation efforts and initiatives on a regular basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFramework (clause 5)\n\nProcess (clause 6)\n\n## top risk 2020 (top 5)\n\nAs part of our risk management process, we perform annual assessment of the key risks that the company faces and strategize action plans to mitigate such risks. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of risk factors, and the company's experience with each of the identified estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe top five key risks that emerged from our risk analysis and discussions during the year include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\nCOVID-19 made 2020 one of the most difficult in IMI's 40-year history. Risks to employee safety, lockdowns lowering demand in our markets, disruption in operations, and the supply chain were our primary challenges. IMI's Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS) and strategies were tested and implemented in full swing which provided mitigating controls and procedures that allowed effective management of organizational health and safety.\n\nAs the pace of change is not likely to slow down, we will be updating our Business Impact Analysis and BCMS Maturity Review in 2021 to identify potential gaps between our execution and best practices.\n\nOperational Strategic Planning & Execution\n\n- Continued downturn in automotive market from 2019 was strained even further by the global pandemic. given the market situation, inability to discover, evaluate and select best decisions among alternatives increased our operational risk. That is why we initiated an organizational transformation and realignment to withstand this difficult period and maintain focus on our long-term strategic areas:\n- Customer & Product Approach - Create more value in products, services, and technologies (Market / Segment Mix)\n- Operational Excellence\n- - Embed quality in all operations through principles of lEAn. (Multispecialist EMS)\n- Organization, Leadership & Culture - Develop future leaders through talent and succession planning, employee engagement, and continuous learning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBetween lockdowns and logistics issues, COVID-19 has revealed some of the vulnerabilities and fragilities in global supply chains. The biggest risk factors are the risks of not being able to source required components, and find alternative parts in a timely manner due to limited manufacturing or temporary closures of suppliers-both of which can compromise our commitments. As such, our first steps as the crisis erupted were to coordinate with customers and suppliers in order to formulate mitigating strategies for supply chain disruptions. Our global Procurement team maintained close coordination with various import and export organizations to expedite release of needed components for production, and delivery of finished goods.\n\nIn the future, our necessary series of adjustments will continue to be informed by our frequent engagements and coordination with customers to better serve them in times like these. We intend to qualify alternative suppliers from various geographic locations, and look for logistics alternatives for timely and efficient delivery of components. We are also investing in supply chain digitalization and talent acquisition to enhance capabilities in data analytics which we expect to result in reduction of spend and total acquisition cost, as well as improved overall efficiency of global procurement.\n\nChanging political, regulatory environment, and macroeconomic factors across the globe were our major risk issues, as customers looked inward to explore alternatives within their and their customers' geographical areas.\n\nWe believe the synergies within our group will help us manage these risks. Together with Ayala Corporation and AC Industrials, we intend to look for opportunities in untapped markets such as ASEAn, Japan, and South Korea. We expect to leverage on our Tier 1 experience in automotive and technical acquisition to reinforce and improve our position in the industry.\n\nThe 'new normal' requires rapid migration to digital technologies. It means virtualization and deployment of online systems at much larger volumes within a short period of time. In this transition, the company is more susceptible to risks of not adequately protecting critical data and infrastructure from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction, theft, viruses, or sabotage. These risks formed the starting point for in-depth reviews that led to our underlying mitigation strategies. For example, our ICT group deployed additional layers of cybersecurity controls, procedures, and capabilities to ensure the integrity of the company's digital environment, its users, and other stakeholders. We also intensified our cyber security training, simulation exercises, and systems vulnerability testing to identify potential gaps and weaknesses.",

The company has grown from a local company that fostered a tight-knit culture of openness and cooperation to a global organization with greater determination in advocating the universal scopes of sustainability. As the 20th largest Ems company in the world, ImI continues to improve and reduce all negative impact on inputs and outputs by continuously aligning ourselves with the uN sustainability development Goals (sdGs). We are deliberate about achieving a circular economy that would have long-term implications on the environment and society, well aware that our legacy is in making sure that our footprint can be measured with the quadruple bottom-line of People, Planet, Purpose and Prosperity in mind.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor us at ImI, employees are not just remunerated fairly but are also provided with opportunities to grow and develop in all aspects with their health and safety as top priority. A strong and healthy workforce benefits the local economy of nearby communities. Their employment, along with the support from the local government, provides a multiplier effect to the local economy enabling more movement of goods and services thereby supporting the company's overall operations.\n\nAs a technology company, ImI is fully aware of how fast product and development cycles are. In today's digital age, the skills and know-how of our employees have become more relevant to stay on top of our industry. Through the Learning and development initiatives of the ImI university, we are able to address the skill gaps and thus provide more value to the company, our customers, and suppliers. As our employees improve and advance, so do our levels of quality and service. As the organization grows and succeeds, the employees follow suit. These are all in line with sdG # 8 in providing decent Work and Economic Growth.\n\nWith our people living our company core values, we are able to drive innovation and collaboration in the various key segments of mobility, connectivity, and smart energy. Our competence is in our ability to work together and co-develop solutions with our partners and customers in design and manufacturing of new technologies that save lives (automotive safety systems and medical devices) and save energy (electric vehicles, power management systems, renewable energy) in line with sdG # 9 Industry Innovation & Infrastructure.\n\nAmidst the rapidly changing technologies in the world today, ImI believes that humanity-our peoplewill drive our growth and our success while in the cusp of our own digital transformation. We do so, mindful of how we can provide better paths for our employees and the world towards a more sustainable future.\n\nAs the world struggles to live with the virus today and at the same time recover from a severe economic downturn, we shall continue to provide valuable services to all our stakeholders while keeping focused on what matters most, as we continue to lead and thrive ready to face the next 40 years of ImI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our FramewOrk\n\nAs a company, we aim to be a trusted partner for all our stakeholders-employees, customers, shareholders, business partners, governments, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThat is why when we look for ways to evolve, we remain firmly committed to our core values-Integrity, customer Focus, concern for Others, and Excellence. They are the foundation of all our activities from the way we collaborate internally to how we engage externally. This same philosophy guides our approach to sustainability, including our policy framework, commitments, management systems, and stakeholder engagement.\n\n## SuStaInaBIlIty FramewOrk\n\nOur framework for sustainability management is the ImI code of conduct, adapted from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) code of conduct. It outlines the standards that we have set for ourselves to ensure that: working conditions are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and manufacturing processes are all environmentally responsible.\n\nIt also extends across our business partners to support a responsible supply chain and a continuous improvement of performance within their own\n\n## laboR\n\nTreat employees with dignity and respect\n\n- \u00b7 Freely chosen Employment\n- \u00b7 child Labor Avoidance\n- \u00b7 Working Hours\n- \u00b7 Wages and Benefits\n- \u00b7 Humane Treatment\n- \u00b7 Non discrimination\n- \u00b7 Freedom of Association\n\n## eTHICs\n\nuphold the highest standards\n\n- \u00b7 Business Integrity Q&A Requirements\n- \u00b7 No Improper Advantage\n- \u00b7 disclosure of Information\n- \u00b7 Intellectual Property\n- \u00b7 Fair Business, Advertising and competition\n- \u00b7 Protection of Identity and Retaliation\n- \u00b7 Responsible sourcing of minerals\n- \u00b7 Privacy\n- \u00b7 Insider Trading\n\n## ManaGeMenT sYsTeMs\n\noperations. In particular, we require suppliers and subcontractors to comply with the same principles laid down in the ImI code of conduct. They are expected to acknowledge and implement the code to remain in good standing. They must:\n\n- \u00b7  operate as an equal opportunity employer and recognize minimum and prevailing wages and benefits;\n- \u00b7  provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from use of any forced or child labor, and prevent harassment or abuse of employees and;\n- \u00b7  support sustainable development, observe environmental commitments to conserve natural resources, minimize the negative impacts of the production, application, and disposal of products, and reduce the use of hazardous materials.\n\nTo enable this journey, we formed a global sustainability Team to facilitate and inform sustainability management and performance across the company.

This means our approach to advance sustainability is at the core of our sourcing network and supply chain. To do so, we work with customers to understand their needs and ensure our engagements are fulfilled in a manner that reflects their sustainability expectations and good practice guidance. In parallel, we communicate our expectations to business partners and carry out due diligence checks. Through this process, we establish accountability and assess compliance. We audit our suppliers once a year.\n\nIn 2020, our Sustainability Team organized training and assessment programs to key IMI suppliers in the Philippines and China based on RBA Code of Conduct Version 6.0 (2018). It includes labor, ethics, data protection, environmental, health and safety, and overall management system. We also provided risk management seminars to suppliers designed to help them adopt a risk mindset throughout their organization as well as to raise awareness of their impact in the achievement of IMI's and its customers' long-term goals and business strategy.\n\nour approach to advance sustainability is at the core of our sourcing network and supply chain.\n\nAlthough we are making good progress, there remains much to do. In 2021, the IMI Code of Conduct will be updated based on the recently released RBA version 7.0. Our audit will involve at least 15 major suppliers, and we will issue an updated Supplier Code of Conduct and corresponding risk management trainings.\n\nTraining session with suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## our poliCy of ConfliCt MineralS\n\nIMI continuously supports the sourcing of minerals and metals from RBA compliant smelters or those not supporting the rebel groups of the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We collect Conflict Minerals Reporting Template from suppliers annually and use the same format in disclosing smelter information to customer through our Customer Focus Team. We check compliance from the publicly available list of conformant smelters through the Responsible Minerals Initiative website. Whenever we uncover non-compliance, we share the results with our suppliers and require them to source responsibly. As part of our contractual agreements, we expect suppliers to practice the same measures for alignment within their operations and supply chains.\n\n## natural Capital\n\nEarly on, we said that our journey toward sustainability will be a long-term undertaking. With the support of our stakeholders, we continue our first steps to sustainable growth and development as one of our priorities.\n\nWe are fully committed to supporting UN SDGs through Ayala Corporation's Sustainability Blueprint. As part of AC Industrials, IMI champions SDG 9Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, as well as SDG 12-Responsible Consumption and Production.

We certified additional four SMEs giving us a total of 127 SMEs supporting our IMI University. The IMI University Learning Management System (LMS) was successfully launched in Bulgaria and Serbia with 26 available LMS modules.\n\nIMI Philippines provided assistance through the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). In August last year, 11 employees achieved a bachelor's degree in engineering and business administration. Five of them were ETEEAP scholars. In partnership with a local university, scholarship grants were awarded to three qualified employees after a thorough screening.\n\n## HealtH and Safety of our worKforCe\n\nWe safeguard the health, safety, and well-being of all members of our global IMI team, at the same time creating a fun working environment\n\nTo raise awareness and participation, we keep our employees informed of various health programs, blood drives, and annual physical examinations. In addition, annual vaccination programs are offered at workable deduction scheme to further encourage employees to avail the services offered.\n\nSafety trainings are conducted regularly as part of our accident prevention program to minimize occupational hazards and risk while improving productivity.\n\nTraining session at IMI China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GLoBAL TRAINING HoURS\n\n2020 data excluding VIA Germany, VIA China & VTS Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safe Man HourS (In MILLIOnS)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 8.0     | 2020        |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 8.9     | 39.2m       |\n| 5.4     | ToTAL       |\n| 6.1     | 2019        |\n| 6.1 5.4 | ToTAL 44.7m |\n| 25.1    | 2018        |\n| 29.6    | 41.6m       |\n| 30.7    | ToTAL       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SaSB Material iSSueS index\n\n## Sustainability accounting Standards Board (SaSB) Standards\n\nAnalyzing the materiality of sustainability information requires an understanding of the specific impact of business on society and the environment, as well as the impact of sustainability challenges on business. Companies operating in a specific industry are more likely to have similar business models and use resources in similar ways than companies in other industries. Therefore, they are likely to have similar sustainability risks and opportunities. The SASB develops sustainability accounting standards at the industry level, focusing on issues that are closely tied to resource use, business models, and other factors at play in the industry.\n\nThe SASB Standards identify industry-specific sustainability factors that likely to be material for 77 industries. They focus on the subset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in each industry.\n\nThey are designed to:\n\n## 1. Meet investor needs\n\nInvestors across asset classes want comparable, consistent, and reliable data on financially material sustainability factors. For example, investors who evaluate corporate performance within an industry context can easily integrate and assess material sustainability factors alongside financial fundamentals.\n\n## 2. Be cost-effective and industry specific\n\nIndustry-specific disclosure reduces costs and minimizes noise by surfacing the most relevant information. IMI uses SASB for Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing - Sustainable Industry Classification System\u2122 (SICS\u2122) #TC0101 as our SASB reference guide.\n\n## 3. Be aligned and can be used with other frameworks and standards\n\nMany companies use both SASB and GRI Standards to meet the needs of various audiences. It is also a practical tool for implementing principles-based frameworks, including those provided by the TCFD and IIRC.\n\n## SASB INDEX - SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES & ToPIcS FoR EmS mANUFAcTURING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| mATERIAL ToPIcS              | AccoUNTING mETRIcS                                                                                                                                                        | SDGS   | PAGE NUmBER (S)         |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Environment                  | \u00b7  GHG Emissions \u00b7  Air Quality \u00b7  Energy Management \u00b7  Water Management \u00b7  Waste & Hazardous Materials \u00b7  Ecological Impact                                              |        | 6 - 9 67 - 68           |\n| Human capital                | \u00b7  Labor Practices \u00b7  Employee Health & Safety \u00b7  Employee Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion                                                                              |        | 6 - 9 62 - 65 69 - 70   |\n| Business model &  Innovation | \u00b7  Product Design & Life Cycle Management \u00b7  Business Model Resilience \u00b7  Supply Chain Management \u00b7  Materials & Resource Efficiency \u00b7  Physical Impact of Climate Change |        | 18 - 31 66              |\n| Leadership &  Governance     | \u00b7  Business Ethics \u00b7  Competitive Behavior \u00b7  Management of Legal & Regulatory Requirements \u00b7  Critical Incident Risk Management \u00b7  Systemic Risk Management              |        | 45 - 57 62 - 65 75 - 86 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We joined the network of supporters of Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in January 2021 to promote a more resilient financial system through climate-related disclosure.\n\nTCFD was set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board in 2015 with the goal of developing voluntary and consistent climate-related financial risk disclosure which can be adopted by companies to help inform investors, lenders, the market, and other members of the public to understand material risk related to climate change.\n\nWith this initiative, IMI is among the first electronic equipment manufacturers in South East Asia, and in the Philippines to join 1,800 companies in 78 countries across the globe to adopt the TCFD framework. Going forward, we will be guided by the Task Force's recommendations which involve four thematic areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, where there are 11 adoptable recommendations which take into\n\n'ImI has always been in the forefront of pioneering ESG values in the manufacturing sector for the Philippines.

By committing to this framework with focus on financial materiality, we hope to make the quality of information valuable to investors.\n\n## BenefitS of tCfd\n\nTCFD adoption supports IMI's vision of being FutureReady as a global technology solutions company that takes into account its responsibility as one of Ayala Corporation and AC Industrial's sustainability champions, in the manufacturing industry, in the Philippines, and across the globe.  IMI reinforces its commitment to help achieve AC/ACI's Sustainability Blueprint, and also to help mitigate the risk of climate change.\n\nCompanies implementing the TCFD recommendations will:\n\n- \u00b7  have easier or better access to capital by increasing investors' and lenders' confidence that the company's climate-related risks are appropriately assessed and managed;\n\n- \u00b7  more effectively meet existing disclosure requirements to report material information in financial filings;\n- \u00b7  increased awareness and understanding of climaterelated risks and opportunities within the company resulting in better risk management and more informed strategic planning; and\n- \u00b7  proactively address investors' demand for climaterelated information in a framework that investors are increasingly asking for, which could ultimately reduce the number of climate-related information requests received\n\nIMI will work and align with the Ayala group to develop its TCFD roadmap to full adoption and implementation in 2021.  In addition, as part of its first steps in this journey, IMI will place emphasis on climate-related risks in the upcoming 2021 Annual Risk Assessment.  Results of the risk assessment will be used in IMI Strategic Planning Conference to cascade IMI's strategy and direction about the risks and opportunities of climate change to the organization.\n\n## mAIN BENEFITS oF TcFD ADoPTIoN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDIScLoSURE REqUIREmENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmoRE EFFEcTIVE RISK mANAGEmENT\n\nADDRESING INVESToR EXPEcTATIoNS\n\nIncreased awareness and understanding of climaterelated risks and opportunities within the company resulting in more effective risk management\n\nProactively addressing investors' demand for climaterelated information in a framework that investors are increasingly asking for\n\nAccESS To cAPITAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEasier or better access to capital by increasing investor's and lenders' confidence\n\nmore effectively meeting existing disclosure requirements to report material information in financial filings\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our wholly owned businesses made US$867 million of revenues, down 14 percent from 2019, as plant shutdowns in various operating regions during the first half of the year significantly affected financial results. Facilities in the Philippines, China, and Mexico all adhered to government mandated lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19, while operating sites in Bulgaria and Czech Republic aligned with the demand slowdown of OEM customers by exercising voluntary reduced work schedules. The global situation led to a 28 percent year-onyear reduction in top line sales in the first half. Revenues in the second half of the year recouped, 36 percent better than first half on the back of strong demand recovery and subsequent normalization of operations. The global demand for security and I-o-T products boosted industrial revenue while mobility-focused European and North American facilities benefited from the rapid rise of global automotive production. In addition, IMI's growing foothold in the profitable medical segment also led to increased higher margin sales for its manufacturing plants in Asia.\n\nSubsidiaries VIA optronics and STI Ltd. posted combined revenues of US$269 million, an increase of nine percent from the previous year. VIA optronics continues its shift towards automotive display solutions by partnering with leading manufacturers in both traditional and electric vehicle spaces. Meanwhile, STI Ltd. is buoyed by the continued growth of its medical segment and recovery of the aerospace and defense markets. The financial information included herein for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 for VIA optronics and STI Ltd. may change; however, IMI does not expect any such changes to be material, in the aggregate, to IMI.\n\n## Gross Margins and Net Profits\n\nOur gross profit was down six percent year-on-year to US$96.3 million due to the decline in revenues from the lockdowns, but we were able to improve our margin to 8.5% from 8.2%. This was driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and cost-cutting initiatives implemented across all sites. In a continuing difficult market environment, we worked with the local government units of countries where we operate to secure various forms of employee-related subsidies in Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France, Mexico, Serbia, and Singapore, thereby reducing the operating costs.\n\nNet loss amounted to US$3.5 million compared with net loss of US$7.8 million in the previous year. The improvement of US$4.3 million was primarily from higher operating income of US$7.9 million following the improved gross profit margins and reduced general and administrative expenses. The second half of 2020 also benefited from a significant swing from a net loss of US$21.5 million in the first half to a positive US$18.0 million in the second half-a testament to IMI's continuing efforts to respond swiftly in times of business disruptions.\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nWe remain resolutely committed to our disciplined approach to capital allocation and to maintaining a robust balance sheet. At the end of 2020, current ratio stood at 1.54:1 compared to 1.49:1 in 2019, and debtto-equity ratio was 0.41:1 from 0.55:1. And from net debt of US$116 million in 2019, we now have close to US$4 million of net cash mainly as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and reduced financial indebtedness.\n\nOur capital expenditures decreased to US$18.7 million in 2020 from US$38.8 million in the prior year due to our focus on cash flow management as well as maximum utilization of existing capacity. We spent most of our capital expenditures on expansionary strategic priorities including additional machineries and building expansions intended for emerging technologies, new projects, and improvement of existing facilities.\n\nAs a percentage of revenues, capital expenditures were 1.6%, down from 3.1% in 2019. We expect capital expenditures in 2021 at a level consistent with 2019 levels as we expand our portfolio of business opportunities.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of Goodwill\n\nUnder PFRS, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment. As of December 31, 2020, the Group's goodwill attributable to the following cash-generating units (CGUs): Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc., Speedy-Tech Electronics, Ltd., IMI Czech Republic s.r.o., VIA Optronics GmbH (VIA), and Surface Technology International Enterprises Limited (STI), amounted to $147.25 million, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, management's assessment process requires significant judgment and is based on assumptions which are subject to higher level of estimation uncertainty due to the current economic conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically revenue growth rate, gross margin and discount rate.\n\nThe Group's disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group's impairment assessment process and the related controls. We involved our internal specialist in evaluating the methodologies and assumptions used. These assumptions include revenue growth rate, gross margin and discount rate. We compared the key assumptions used such as revenue growth rate against actual historical performance of the CGU and industry outlook, the gross margins against historical rates, and other relevant external data, taking into consideration the impact associated with coronavirus pandemic. We tested the parameters used in the\n\ndetermination of the discount rate against market data. We also reviewed the Group's disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is more sensitive; specifically those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.\n\nValuation of the put options arising from the acquisition of VIA Optronics GmbH (VIA) and STI\n\nThe terms of the acquisition of VIA in 2016 and STI in 2017 included put options that granted the noncontrolling shareholders the right to sell their shares in the acquiree to the Group. This resulted to a recognition of financial liability which is being revalued at every reporting period. In 2020, the shareholders agreement for VIA was amended which resulted to the cancellation of the put option and reclassification of the put option liability amounting to $15.3 million to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining put options liability for STI amounted to $1.59 million. We considered the valuation of the put options to be a key audit matter because it requires significant judgment and is based on assumptions which are subject to higher level of estimation uncertainty due to the current economic conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically, revenue growth rate, EBITDA multiple, discount rate, forecasted interest rate and the probability of trigger events occurring.\n\nDetails of the transactions and the valuation of the put options are disclosed in Notes 18 and 32 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nWe involved our internal specialists in testing the fair values of the put options, including the evaluation of the methodologies and key assumptions used. These assumptions include revenue growth rate, EBITDA multiple, discount rate, forecasted interest rate and probability of trigger events occurring. We evaluated the revenue growth rate against the acquirees' historical financial performance, the Group's business plan for the acquirees and industry outlook. We evaluated the EBITDA multiple against market data of comparable companies. We tested the parameters used in the derivation of the discount rate against market data. We compared the interest rate used in forecasting the future equity value to the risk-free rate in Germany and the United Kingdom, and inquired with management its basis for the probability of trigger events occurring. We also examined the agreement supporting the cancellation of the put option granted to the noncontrolling shareholders.\n\nRecoverability of capitalized product development costs and property, plant and equipment\n\nUnder PFRS, the Group is required to test the recoverability of nonfinancial assets when indicators of impairment exist. In 2020, the continuing gross loss position since the start of mass production for the production line for certain customers in Philippines and Mexico has been assessed as an impairment indicator requiring an impairment assessment. The management's impairment assessment process requires significant judgment and is based on assumptions which are subject to higher level of estimation uncertainty due to the current economic conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically revenue growth rate and inclusion of future price increases in the revenue growth, cost ratios and discount rates. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of the capitalized product development costs and the property, plant, and equipment specifically used in the projects amounted to $10.99 million, and the impairment loss recognized for the year amounted to $7.22 million. These balances are considered significant to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's disclosures about the capitalized product development costs and property, plant and equipment are included in Notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group's impairment assessment process and the related controls. We involved our internal specialist in evaluating the methodologies and assumptions used. These assumptions include revenue growth rate, cost ratios and discount rate. We compared the key assumptions used such as revenue growth rate and cost ratios against actual historical performance of the specific production line and other relevant external data, taking into consideration the impact associated with coronavirus pandemic. We tested the parameters used in the derivation of the discount rate against market data. We also reviewed the Group's disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is more sensitive; specifically, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of the capitalized product development costs and property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with PSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Cyril Jasmin B.

(VTS)\n\nOn April 9, 2018, VIA and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. (Toppan) entered into an agreement to serve the market for copper-based metal mesh touch sensors. The agreement provides that Toppan transfer 65% of its shares in VTS to VIA. VTS is a newly formed spin-off company of Toppan.\n\nVTS develops and manufactures the metal mesh touch sensors in Japan on the existing premises of Toppan. The new setup strengthens VIA's portfolio of differentiated and value-added sensor technology for touch panels, touch-display modules, display head assemblies, and interactive display systems across multiple markets and segments.\n\nThe Group elected to measure the non-controlling interest in VTS at the proportionate share of its interest in the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nThe net assets recognized in December 31, 2018 financial statements were based on a provisional assessment of their fair value. The valuation had not been completed by the date the 2018 financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn March 2019, the purchase price allocation was finalized. The fair value of the property, plant and equipment (PPE) and intangible asset increased by $7.16 million and $2.58 million, respectively (see Notes 10 and 12). The increase in fair value of PPE arose from the assessment and valuation mainly of technical equipment and machinery, buildings and improvements and other equipment, which was determined using current replacement cost method. The increase in intangible asset is due to the identification and valuation of customer relationship as a separate asset with fair value determined using the Multi Period Excess Earnings Method (MEEM). PPE was depreciated using various useful lives ranging from 3-10 years while the customer relationship is amortized over a period of 5 years.\n\nAs a result, deferred tax liability on the increase in fair value of the property, plant and equipment and intangible asset was recognized amounting to $3.32 million. There was also corresponding recognition of gain on a bargain purchase amounting to $2.41 million upon finalization and the provisional goodwill amounting to $0.97 million was reversed. In addition, additional depreciation and amortization from increase in fair values of property and equipment and intangible assets net of share of non-controlling interest totaling to $0.73 million was recognized in 2018.\n\nBelow are the final fair values and provisional fair values as of December 31, 2019:\n\n|                                                 | Fair Values   | Provisional  Fair Values   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| Assets                                          |               |                            |\n| Receivables                                     | $184,781      | $184,781                   |\n| Inventories                                     | 1,338,391     | 1,243,686                  |\n| Property, plant and equipment (Note 10)         | 7,252,918     | 97,536                     |\n| Intangible assets (Note 12)                     | 7,835,218     | 5,258,211                  |\n|                                                 | 16,611,308    | 6,784,214                  |\n| Liabilities                                     |               |                            |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                        | 3,321,558     | -                          |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities                    | 5,254,010     | 5,254,010                  |\n|                                                 | 8,575,568     | 5,254,010                  |\n| Net Assets                                      | $8,035,740    | $1,530,204                 |\n| Non-controlling interest (35%)                  | (4,065,562)   | (535,571)                  |\n| Goodwill (Gain on a bargain purchase) (Note 11) | (2,411,951)   | 970,725                    |\n| Cost of acquisition                             | $1,558,227    | $1,965,358                 |",

Summary of Significant Accounting and Financial Reporting Policies\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (USD) and all values are rounded to the nearest dollar, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous period.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in compliance with PFRS.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nSpecifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:\n\n- a. Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)\n- b. Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- c. The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- a. The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee\n- b. Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- c. The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included or excluded in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control or until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nNon-controlling interests pertain to the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Parent Company. Any equity instruments issued by a subsidiary that are not owned by the Parent Company are non-controlling interests including preferred shares and options under share-based transactions. The portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries not wholly-owned are presented separately in the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of financial position, separately from the Parent Company's equity. Non-controlling interests are net of any outstanding subscription receivable.\n\nLosses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nIn accounting for call and put options over non-controlling interests, management determines whether it has present access to the returns associated with the non-controlling interests. If the options give the Group access to the returns over the non-controlling interests, the Group consolidates the acquiree as if it acquired a 100% interest.\n\nIf the options do not give the Group present access to the returns over the non-controlling interests, the Group takes the view that the non-controlling interests should be accounted for in accordance with PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, and must be presented within equity separate from the equity of the Parent Company, until the option is exercised.\n\nThe call option is accounted for under PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, as a derivative instrument carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe financial liability for the put option is accounted for under PFRS 9 like any other written put option on equity instruments. On initial recognition, the corresponding debit is made to a component of equity attributable to the parent, not to the non-controlling interest. All subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the financial liability that result from the remeasurement of the present value payable on exercise are recognized in profit or loss also attributable to the parent.\n\nIf the put option is exercised, the entity accounts for an increase in its ownership interest. At the same time, the entity derecognizes the financial liability and reverses the component of equity that was reduced on initial recognition. If the put option expires unexercised, the financial liability is reclassified to the same component of equity that was reduced on initial recognition.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent Company. The difference is included as part of additional paid-in capital.\n\nIf the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial years except for the new PFRS, amended PFRS and improvements to PFRS which were adopted beginning January 1, 2020. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 3, Business Combinations, Definition of a Business\n\nThe amendments to PFRS 3 clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. These amendments may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations.\n\nThese amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it did not enter to any business combinations during the period.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe amendments to PFRS 9 provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainties about the timing and or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.\n\nThese amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, and PAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, Definition of Material\n\nThe amendments provide a new definition of material that states 'information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.'\n\nThe amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users.\n\nThe amendments were consistently applied on the disclosures of the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued on March 29, 2018\n\nThe Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained therein override the concepts or requirements in any standard. The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the standard-setters in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards.\n\nThe revised Conceptual Framework includes new concepts, provides updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts.\n\nThe amendments were consistently applied on the disclosures of the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 16, COVID-19-related Rent Concessions\n\nThe amendments provide relief to lessees from applying the PFRS 16 requirement on lease modifications to rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification if it meets all of the following criteria:\n\n- \uf0b7 The rent concession is a direct consequence of COVID-19;\n- \uf0b7 The change in lease payments results in a revised lease consideration that is substantially the same as, or less than, the lease consideration immediately preceding the change;\n- \uf0b7 Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021; and\n- \uf0b7 There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.\n\nA lessee that applies this practical expedient will account for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession in the same way it would account for a change that is not a lease modification, i.e., as a variable lease payment.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted.\n\nThe Group adopted the amendments to PFRS 16 using the practical expedient beginning January 1, 2020 and recognized rent concession as variable lease payments amounting to $0.42 million as part of cost of sales.\n\nPronouncements issued but not yet effective are listed below. Unless otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect that the future adoption of the said pronouncements will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Group intends to adopt the following pronouncements when they become effective.\n\nEffective beginning on or after January 1, 2021\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 9, PFRS 7, PFRS 4 and PFRS 16, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nThe amendments provide the following temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate (RFR):\n\n- \uf0b7 Practical expedient for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of IBOR reform\n- \uf0b7 Relief from discontinuing hedging relationships\n- \uf0b7 Relief from the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component\n\nThe Group shall also disclose information about:\n\n- \uf0b7 The about the nature and extent of risks to which the entity is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to IBOR reform, and how the entity manages those risks; and\n- \uf0b7 Their progress in completing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, and how the entity is managing that transition\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 and apply retrospectively, however, the Group is not required to restate prior periods.\n\nEffective beginning on or after January 1, 2022\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n\nThe amendments are intended to replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements. The amendments added an exception to the recognition principle of PFRS 3, Business Combinations, to avoid the issue of potential 'day 2' gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of PAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, or Philippine-IFRIC 21, Levies, if incurred separately.\n\nAt the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to PFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and apply prospectively.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 16, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\n\nThe amendments prohibit entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.",

        "page_content": "- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 37, Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The Group will apply these amendments to contracts for which it has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments.\n\n- \uf0b7 Annual Improvements to PFRSs 2018-2020 Cycle\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 1, First-time Adoption of Philippines Financial Reporting Standards, Subsidiary as a first-time adopter\n\nThe amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of PFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to PFRS. This amendment is also applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of PFRS 1.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendments to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 41, Agriculture, Taxation in fair value measurements\n\nThe amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of PAS 41 that entities exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of PAS 41.\n\nThe amendments are expected to have no impact on the Group.\n\n## Effective beginning on or after January 1, 2023\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThe amendments clarify paragraphs 69 to 76 of PAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:\n\n- \uf0b7 What is meant by a right to defer settlement\n- \uf0b7 That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period\n- \uf0b7 That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right\n- \uf0b7 That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and must be applied retrospectively. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice and whether existing loan agreements may require renegotiation.\n\n- \uf0b7 PFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nPFRS 17 is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, PFRS 17 will replace PFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. This new standard on insurance contracts applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply.\n\nThe overall objective of PFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in PFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, PFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of PFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:\n\n- \uf0b7 A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)\n- \uf0b7 A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts\n\nPFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted.\n\nThe amendments are expected to have no impact on the Group.\n\n## Deferred effectivity\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, and PAS 28, Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n\nThe amendments address the conflict between PFRS 10 and PAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transfer to an associate or joint venture involves a business as defined in PFRS 3. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associate or joint venture.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, the Financial Reporting Standards Council deferred the original effective date of January 1, 2016 of the said amendments until the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) completes its broader review of the research project on equity accounting that may result in the simplification of accounting for such transactions and of other aspects of accounting for associates and joint ventures.\n\nThe significant accounting policies that have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are summarized below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Current versus Noncurrent Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on current or noncurrent classification.\n\nAn asset is current when it is:\n\n- \uf0b7 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;\n- \uf0b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- \uf0b7 Expected to be realized within twelve months after the balance sheet date; or\n- \uf0b7 Cash or cash equivalent, unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.\n\nAll other assets are classified as noncurrent.\n\nA liability is current when:\n\n- \uf0b7 It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;\n- \uf0b7 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- \uf0b7 It is due to be settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date; or\n- \uf0b7 There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as noncurrent.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash includes cash on hand and in banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\nInitial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, FVOCI, and FVPL.\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under PFRS 15.\n\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n\n- \uf0b7 Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)\n- \uf0b7 Financial assets at FVOCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)\n- \uf0b7 Financial assets designated at FVOCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)\n- \uf0b7 Financial assets at FVPL\n\nThe financial assets of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments) and financial assets designated at FVOCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments).\n\n## Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)\n\nThis category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \uf0b7 The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \uf0b7 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortized cost includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and miscellaneous deposits included under 'Other noncurrent assets' account.\n\n## Financial assets designated at FVOCI (equity instruments)\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under PAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of income when the right of payment has been\n\nestablished, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in club shares and non-listed common equity shares under this category.\n\n## Financial assets at FVPL\n\nFinancial assets at FVPL include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVPL, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at FVPL, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at FVPL on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.\n\nFinancial assets at FVPL are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nThis category includes derivative instruments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at FVOCI.\n\nA derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if: the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Group's consolidated balance sheet) when:\n\n- \uf0b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \uf0b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'passthrough' arrangement \u037e and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\n\nContinuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\n## Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at FVPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\n\nFor those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is",

        "page_content": "based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\n## b) Financial liabilities\n\nInitial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at FVPL\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by PFRS 9. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVPL are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in PFRS 9 are satisfied.\n\nThis category applies to the Group's derivative liabilities and financial liabilities on put options over the non-controlling interests.\n\n## Other financial liabilities\n\nThis category pertains to financial liabilities that are not held for trading or not designated as at FVPL upon the inception of the liability. These include liabilities arising from operations and borrowings.\n\nAfter initial measurement, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on the acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when other financial liabilities are derecognized, as well as through the EIR amortization process.\n\nThis category applies to the Group's accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding advances from customers, advances from third party, statutory payables and taxes payables), loans payable and longterm debt.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or has expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## c) Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheets if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nThe Group measures its derivatives, financial assets at FVOCI and financial liabilities at FVPL at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortized cost are disclosed in Note 32.\n\nThe fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement\n\nis based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \uf0b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \uf0b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure the fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which the fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- \uf0b7 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n- \uf0b7 Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n- \uf0b7 Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at balance sheet date.\n\nFor purposes of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV). Cost is determined using the moving average method for raw materials and supplies. For finished goods and work-in-process, cost includes direct materials, direct labor, and a proportion of manufacturing overhead costs based on normal operating capacity determined using the moving average method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. In the event that NRV is lower than cost, the decline shall be recognized as an expense in profit or loss.\n\n## Deferred Charges\n\nDeferred charges are recognized when the Group incurred expenses but the benefits are not expected to be realized on a short-term basis. These are normally chargeable to the customers as part of the selling price of the manufactured items.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment consists of its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditures incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of property, plant and equipment beyond its originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditures are capitalized as additional costs of property, plant and equipment.\n\nConstruction in progress is stated at cost, less impairment loss, if any. This includes costs of construction and installation of equipment and machinery items, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its intended use. Construction in progress is not depreciated until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into operational use.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment commences once the property, plant and equipment are available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (EUL) of the assets as follows:",

The EUL of property, plant and equipment are based on expected asset utilization as anchored on business plans and strategies that also consider expected future technological developments and market behavior to ensure that the period of depreciation is consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.  Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nFully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the accounts until these are no longer used and no further depreciation is charged to profit or loss.\n\n## Borrowing Costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\n## Business Combinations and Goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in the consolidated statements of income under 'Operating expenses' account.\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability, that is a financial instrument and within the scope of PFRS 9 is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of PFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.\n\nEach unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated should:\n\n- \uf0b7 Represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and\n\n- \uf0b7 Not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with PFRS 8, Operating Segments.\n\nWhen goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill allocated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the acquirer shall account for the combination using those provisional values. The acquirer shall recognize any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date as follows: (i) the carrying amount of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability that is recognized or adjusted as a result of completing the initial accounting shall be calculated as if its fair value at the acquisition date had been recognized from that date; (ii) goodwill or any gain recognized shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the adjustment to the fair value at the acquisition date of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability being recognized or adjusted; and (iii) comparative information presented for the periods before the initial accounting for the combination is complete shall be presented as if the initial accounting has been completed from the acquisition date.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as of the date of acquisition.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognized as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:\n\n- (a)  The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;\n- (b) Its intention to complete and ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- (c)  How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;\n- (d) The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n- (e)  Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortized over the period of expected benefit.\n\nThe EUL of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their EUL and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each balance sheet date. Changes in the EUL or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe EUL of intangible assets of finite useful life are as follows:\n\n|                           | Years   |\n|---------------------------|---------|\n| Customer relationships    | 5       |\n| Unpatented technology     | 5       |\n| Licenses                  | 3-5     |\n| Intellectual properties   | 5       |\n| Product development costs | 5       |\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and those not yet available for use are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.",

That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## Group as Lessee\n\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\n\n## Right-of-use Assets\n\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-ofuse assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term Leases (STL) and Leases of Low-value Assets\n\nThe Group applies the STL recognition exemption to those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group applies the lowvalue assets recognition exemption to leases of underlying assets with a value, when new, of US$5,000 and below. Lease payments on short-term leases and low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Leases (Prior to Adoption of PFRS 16 beginning January 1, 2019)\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date. The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets, or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\n## Operating and finance lease commitments - Group as lessee\n\nFinance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Group are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments and included in the 'Property, plant and equipment' account, with the corresponding liability to the lessor included in the 'Accounts payable and accrued expenses' account for the current portion, and 'Noncurrent portion of obligation under finance lease' account for the noncurrent portion in the consolidated balance sheets. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized under 'Interest expense and bank charges' account in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nCapitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the EUL of the assets and the respective lease terms.\n\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the assets are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.\n\n## Impairment of Nonfinancial Assets\n\nThe Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is an indication that a nonfinancial asset (e.g., deferred charges, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets) is impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nIn determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nThe Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally covered a period of five years.\n\nFor nonfinancial assets, excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in profit or loss. After such reversal, the depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining EUL.\n\nAll goodwill of the Group are tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and also tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount is impaired. Provisional goodwill allocated to a CGU is also tested for impairment even if the fair value exercise is not complete during the year.\n\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nWhen the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.\n\nProvisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.",

        "page_content": "## Equity Capital stock\n\nCapital stock is measured at par value for all shares issued and outstanding. When the Parent Company issues more than one class of stock, a separate account is maintained for each class of stock and the number of shares issued.\n\nPreferred shares may be issued with various rights. In determining whether a preference share is financial liability or equity instrument, the issuer is required to assess the particular rights attaching to the share to determine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristic of a financial liability. A preference share redeemable only at the holder's option is an equity instrument because the issuer does not have a present or future obligation to transfer financial assets to the shareholder.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\nAdditional paid-in capital pertains to the difference of the par value and selling price of issued and outstanding shares of stock. Direct costs incurred related to equity issuance, such as underwriting, accounting and legal fees, printing costs and taxes are charged to 'Additional paid-in capital' account. If additional paid-in capital is not sufficient, the excess is charged against 'Retained earnings' account.\n\nThe financial liabilities for the put options over the non-controlling interests are recognized at the acquisition date with a debit to additional paid-in capital.\n\nAn increase or decrease in a parent's ownership interest that does not result in a loss of control of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction, i.e. a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. A parent's ownership interest may change without a loss of control, e.g. when a parent buys shares from or sells shares to a non-controlling interest, a subsidiary redeems shares held by a noncontrolling interest, or when a subsidiary issues new shares to a non-controlling interest.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. PFRS 10 states that 'the entity shall recognize directly in equity any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, and attribute it to the owners of the parent. The Group recognize this difference under 'Additional paid-in capital' account.\n\n## Subscriptions receivable\n\nSubscriptions receivable pertains to the uncollected portion of the subscribed shares.\n\n## Retained earnings and dividends on capital stock of the Parent Company\n\nRetained earnings represent net accumulated earnings of the Group, less dividends declared. Dividends on capital stock are recognized as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by Parent Company's BOD.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost and is presented as a deduction from equity. When the shares are retired, the 'Capital stock' account is reduced by its par value and the excess of cost over par value upon retirement is debited to 'Additional paid-in capital' account to the extent of the specific or average additional paid-in capital when the shares were issued and to 'Retained earnings' account for the remaining balance.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n- a) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group is in the business of providing electronic manufacturing and other related services to various customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\n## Manufacturing of goods\n\nThe Group provides manufacturing services in accordance with the customer's specifications. The Group promises to provide a combined performance obligation comprised of non-distinct goods or services, which include issuance of materials to production, assembly, testing and packaging.\n\nContracts with customers are generally classified as turnkey or consignment. In a turnkey contract, the Group procures the materials and provides the assembly services to the customer. In a consignment contract, the Group only provides assembly services to the customer.\n\nFor turnkey contracts, revenue is recognized over time since the products created have no alternative use to the Group and the Group has right to payment for performance completed to date\n\n2\n\nincluding the related profit margin, in case of termination for reasons other than the Group's failure to perform as promised.\n\nFor goods manufactured not covered by customer purchase orders or firm delivery schedule, revenues are recognized at a point in time, when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally when goods are shipped or goods are received by the customer, depending on the corresponding agreement with the customer.\n\nFor consignment contracts, revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Group performs.\n\nRevenue from optical bonding technology and metal mesh touch sensors (VIA and VTS) Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nFor optical bonding services performed under the consignment model, revenue is recognized at a point in time based on the fact that the assets created have alternative use to the Group entities. This is when the enhancement process is finalized, the customer removes the enhanced products from the consignment stock and is invoiced, according to contract.\n\nFor the sale of products under the full service model, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the products are transferred to the customers, generally on delivery of the products.\n\n## Non-recurring engineering services\n\nNon-recurring engineering charges, tooling and other pre-production revenue stream (NREs) are recognized at a point in time since the criteria for over time recognition is not met. This is based on the assessment that while, in general, the Group has no alternative use for these NREs, either due to customization or restrictions by the customer, there is no assurance or relevant experience that IMI has enforceable right to payment or can recover the cost, plus reasonable margin, in case of contract termination. Point in time revenue recognition for NREs would mean revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the NREs (transfer of control).\n\nThe Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., customer options that provide material rights to customers, warranties). In determining the transaction price, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration and consideration payable to the customer, if any.\n\n## Variable consideration\n\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n\n## Significant financing component\n\nThe Group's contracts with its customers are short-term in nature. Using the practical expedient in PFRS 15, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration of the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\nThe Group does not have significant separate performance obligations wherein the transaction price needs to be allocated as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## b) Contract balances\n\n## Contract asset\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.",

        "page_content": "## Contract liability\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). A contract liability is recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## c) Cost to obtain a contract\n\nThe Group pays sales commission to its employees for each contract that they obtain. The Group has elected to apply the optional practical expedient for costs to obtain a contract which allows the Group to immediately expense sales commissions (included under operating expenses) because the amortization period of the asset that the Group otherwise would have used is one year or less.\n\n## Other Income\n\nInterest income\n\nInterest income is recognized as it accrues using the EIR method.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established.\n\n## Miscellaneous income\n\nMiscellaneous income is recognized as the Group earns the right over it.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThis account includes cost of goods sold and cost of services. These expenses pertain to the direct expenses incurred by the Group in relation to the products and services offered. Cost of sales is recognized when the related goods are sold and when services are rendered.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nThis account pertains to the general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses are recognized when incurred, except for short term and low value rental expense, which is computed on a straight linebasis over the lease term.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is initially recognized as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to the acquisition or construction of a fixed asset, it is initially recognized as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as income in equal amounts over the period of depreciation of the related asset.\n\n## Foreign Currency Transactions\n\nFunctional currency is determined for each entity within the Group and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured and recorded using that functional currency. For consolidation purposes, the foreign subsidiaries' balances are translated to USD, which is the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to profit or loss. Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.\n\nThe functional currencies of the Group's foreign subsidiaries are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As at the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Parent Company at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their profit and loss accounts are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and reported as a separate component of equity.\n\nExchange differences arising from elimination of intragroup balances and intragroup transactions are recognized in profit or loss. As an exception, if the exchange differences arise from intragroup balances that, in substance, forms part of an entity's net investment in a foreign operation, the exchange\n\ndifferences are not to be recognized in profit or loss, but are recognized in OCI and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profit.\n\nCurrent tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions, when appropriate.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses can be utilized, except:\n\n- \uf0b7 When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \uf0b7 In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \uf0b7 When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \uf0b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority.\n\nFor periods where an Income Tax Holiday (ITH) is in effect, no deferred taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as the ITH status of the Group neither results in a deductible temporary difference or taxable temporary difference. However, for temporary differences that are expected to reverse beyond the ITH, deferred taxes are recognized.\n\n## Earnings per Share (EPS) Attributable to Equity Holders of the Parent Company\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common equity holders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and adjusted to give retroactive effect to any stock",

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common equity holders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted EPS does not assume conversion, exercise or other issue of potential common shares that would have an antidilutive effect on EPS.\n\n## Retirement and Other Employee Benefits\n\nDefined benefit plans\n\nThe Parent Company, PSi, IMI BG and IMI Serbia maintain separate defined benefit plans covering substantially all of their employees. The plans of the Parent Company and PSi are funded and noncontributory retirement plans administered by their respective Boards of Trustees, while that of IMI BG and IMI Serbia is unfunded and noncontributory.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is actuarially determined using the projected unit credit method. This method reflects services rendered by employees up to the date of valuation and incorporates assumptions concerning employees' projected salaries. Actuarial valuations are conducted with sufficient regularity, with the option to accelerate when significant changes to underlying assumptions occur.\n\nService costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine settlements are recognized as expense in profit or loss. Past service costs are recognized when plan amendment or curtailment occurs.\n\nNet interest on net retirement liabilities is the change during the period in net retirement liabilities that arises from the passage of time which is determined by applying the discount rate based on government bonds to net retirement liabilities. Net interest on retirement liabilities is recognized as expense or income in profit or loss.\n\nRemeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest on net retirement liabilities) are recognized immediately in OCI in the period in which they arise. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nNet retirement liabilities are the aggregate of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the balance sheet date reduced by the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net retirement asset to the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nPlan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund. Plan assets are not available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group. The fair value of plan assets is based on market price information. When no market price is available, the fair value of plan assets is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects both the risk associated with the plan assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets (or, if they have no maturity, the expected period until the settlement of the related obligations).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Parent Company's subsidiaries in Singapore, China and Hong Kong, Czech Republic, Mexico, Germany, and UK participate in the respective national retirement schemes defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. These retirement schemes are considered as defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a plan under which the subsidiary pays fixed contributions. Each subsidiary has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The required contributions to the national retirement schemes are recognized as retirement expense as accrued.\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore make contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution scheme. Contributions to the CPF scheme are recognized as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.\n\n## China\n\nThe subsidiaries incorporated and operating in China are required to provide certain staff retirement benefits to their employees under existing China regulations, a defined contribution scheme. Retirement contributions are provided at rates stipulated by China regulations and are contributed to a retirement fund managed by government agencies, which are responsible for administering these amounts for the subsidiaries' employees. Contributions to this defined contribution scheme are recognized as expense in the period in which the related service is performed.\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nThe subsidiary in Hong Kong participates in the defined provident fund. The subsidiary and its employees make monthly contributions to the scheme at 5% of the employees' earnings as defined under the Mandatory Provident Fund legislation. Contributions to this defined contribution scheme are recognized as expense in the period in which the related service is performed.\n\n## IMI CZ\n\nIMI CZ, under its collective agreement, is committed to pay contributions to life and retirement insurance of its loyal employees. This is done on a monthly basis as part of payroll expenses and only over the employment period. IMI CZ is not obliged to any other payments if employment terminates.\n\n## IMI MX\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican Labor Law, IMI MX provides seniority premium benefits to its employees under certain circumstances. These benefits consist of a one-time payment equivalent to twelve days of wage for each year of service (at the employee's most recent salary, but not to exceed twice the legal minimum wage), payable to all employees with fifteen or more years of service, as well as to certain employees terminated involuntarily prior to the vesting of their seniority premium benefit.\n\nIMI MX also provides statutorily mandated severance benefits to its employees terminated under certain circumstances. Such benefits consist of a one-time payment of three months wages plus twenty days wages for each year of service payable upon involuntary termination without just cause. These are recognized when such an event occurs.\n\n## VIA\n\nVIA only has defined contribution plans relating to statutory pension. Funds paid by the employees and employers are not saved or invested but are used to pay current pension obligations. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\n## STI\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the period in which the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.\n\nWhen contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.\n\n## Employee leave entitlement\n\nEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognized as a liability when they accrue to the employees. The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the balance sheet date is recognized for services rendered by employees up to the end of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Share-based Payment Transactions\n\nCertain employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions').\n\nThe Group has an employee stock ownership plan (ESOWN) which allows the grantees to purchase the Parent Company's shares at a discounted price. The Group recognizes employee benefit expense over the holding period. The Group treats its ESOWN plan as option payable within a given period. These are accounted for similar to the methods outlined in PFRS 2. Dividends paid on the awards that have vested are deducted from equity while those paid on awards that are unvested are charged to profit or loss.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nThe Group is organized and managed separately according to geographical locations of businesses. The geographical segments are segregated as follows: Philippines, China, Europe, Mexico, Germany/UK, and USA/Japan/Singapore/IMI UK. These geographical businesses are the basis upon which the Group reports its operating segment information presented in Note 29.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. These are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.",

Post period events that are non-adjusting events are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements when material.\n\n## 4. Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with PFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Uncertainty about these judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Judgments\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:\n\nDetermining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options - Group as lessee The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nThe Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., a change in business strategy, construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customization to the leased asset).\n\nThe Group's leases consist mainly of land, production facilities and warehouses and office buildings (land and buildings). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of land and buildings due to the significance of these assets to its operations. These leases have a lease term of more than one year and there will be a significant negative effect on the business if a replacement is not readily available.\n\n## Operating lease commitments - Group as lessee (Prior to adoption of PFRS 16)\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts with various lease contracts for office spaces and land. The Group has determined that all significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties are retained by the lessor. Further details are disclosed in Note 30.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\n- \uf0b7 Identifying contracts with customers\n\nGenerally, a valid and approved manufacturing service agreement (MSA), scheduling agreement (SA), customer accepted quote, customer forecast, and/or customer purchase order or firm delivery schedule will be in place before the Group provides services or manufacture goods for the customers. The Group is not obligated to transfer any goods or provide services until the customer submits a purchase order or firm delivery schedule under the MSA or SA, respectively. The purchase order or firm delivery schedule creates the enforceable rights and obligations and is therefore evaluated together with the MSA or SA for revenue recognition in accordance with PFRS 15.\n\n- \uf0b7 Determining the timing of revenue recognition\n\nThe Group assessed that revenue from manufacturing of goods shall be recognized over time or point in time. For turnkey contracts wherein the products created have no alternative use to the Group and the Group has right to payment for performance completed to date including the related profit margin, in case of termination for reasons other than the Group's failure to perform as promised, revenue is recognized over time. For goods manufactured not covered by customer purchase orders or firm delivery schedule, revenues are recognized at a point in time. For consignment contracts, revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Group performs.\n\n- \uf0b7 Determining the method of measure of progress for revenue recognized over time The Group measures progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using an input method (i.e., costs incurred). Management believes that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services to the customer because the Group provides\n\n2\n\nintegration service to produce a combined output and each item in the combined output may not transfer an equal amount of value to the customer.\n\n## Product development costs\n\nExpenditures for the development of new products or production systems are recognized as intangible assets if such expenditures, with a high degree of certainty, will result in future economic benefits for the Group. The rules require stringent criteria to be met for these development expenditures to be recognized as assets such as determining technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset. Management assessed that it is able to meet the identifiability and separability criteria provided in PAS 38, Intangible Assets, on the premise that the projects involved are in separate locations from other existing lines and that each project arises from a contractual right between the Group and each customer. Moreover, management is able to demonstrate that the projects are in the advanced stage of development.\n\n## Functional currency\n\nPAS 21, Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, requires management to use its judgment to determine each entity's functional currency such that it most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to the Group. In making this judgment, each entity within the Group considers the currency in which the sales prices for its goods and services are denominated and settled.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings. The estimates of the probable costs of the resolutions and assessments of these claims have been developed in consultation with outside counsels handling the defense in these matters and are based upon analyses of potential results. The Group currently does not believe that these proceedings and tax assessments will have a material effect on the Group's financial position. It is possible, however, that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the estimates or in the effectiveness of the strategies relating to these proceedings.\n\n## Further details are disclosed in Note 34.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. The Group based its estimates and assumptions on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\nLease commitments - Group as lessee\n\n## Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate\n\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group 'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions) or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases are not in the subsidiary's functional currency).\n\nThe Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary's stand-alone credit rating).\n\n## Fair value of the financial liabilities on put options\n\nThe acquisition of VIA in 2016 and STI in 2017 included call and put options over the non-controlling interests. These options are considered when determining whether the entity has obtained control over the acquiree if in substance the entity already has access to the returns associated with that ownership interest. Management assessed that the options do not give the Group present access to the returns associated with the non-controlling interests in subsidiary and, therefore, accounted for the noncontrolling interests under PFRS 10, while the financial liability was accounted for under PFRS 9 measured at the present value of the redemption amount, with a debit to a component of equity attributable to the parent.\n\nManagement assessed that the discounted, probability-weighted cash flow methodology is the appropriate model to derive the present value of the redemption amount. The key estimates and assumptions used in the valuation include impact of coronavirus pandemic, the current equity value of the acquiree, forecasted interest rate and probability of trigger events occurring. The equity value of",

        "page_content": "VIA is determined using the discounted cash flow approach. The future cash flows are projected using the projected revenue growth rate of VIA. The discount rate represents the current market assessment of the risk specific to the acquiree, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the acquiree and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital. For STI, management used the market approach by approximating the EBITDA multiple taken from comparable companies of STI that are engaged in providing electronic services solutions to derive its current equity value. Management computed EBITDA as the difference of forecasted gross profit and selling and administrative expenses before depreciation and amortization.\n\nFurther details on the valuation of the put options are disclosed in Notes 18 and 32.\n\n## Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance, etc.).\n\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., industry compounded annual growth rate) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analyzed.\n\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.\n\nThe Group has considered impact of COVID-19 pandemic and revised its assumptions in determining the macroeconomic variables and loss rates in the computation of ECL. The changes in the gross carrying amount of receivables from the sales of the Group during the year and impact of COVID-19 pandemic did not materially affect the allowance for ECLs.\n\nFurther details on the expected credit loss are disclosed in Note 6.\n\n## Estimating NRV of inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and NRV. This requires the Group to make an estimate of the inventories' estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, costs of completion and costs necessary to make a sale to determine the NRV. In line with the impact of COVID-19, the Group experienced lower demand and production that resulted to lower sales in 2020. In the event that NRV is lower than cost, the decline is recognized as an expense.  Further details on inventories are disclosed in Note 8.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nThe Group computes depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite useful life on a straight-line basis over the assets' EUL. The EUL and depreciation and amortization method are reviewed annually to ensure that these are consistent with the expected pattern of the economic benefits from the assets. This requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected asset utilization from business plans and strategies, future technical developments and market behavior to determine the expected pattern of economic benefits from the assets. Changes in the EUL or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the depreciation and amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are recognized in profit or loss, in the expense category, consistent with the function of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nFurther details on property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets are disclosed in Notes 10, 30 and 12, respectively.\n\n## Evaluation of impairment of nonfinancial assets\n\nThe Group reviews certain property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred charges, for impairment of value. Except for the impairment for goodwill which is assessed at least annually, the impairment evaluation for the other nonfinancial assets includes considering certain indications of impairment such as significant changes in asset usage, significant decline in assets' market value, obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected\n\nhistorical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. Moreover, lockdown to Group manufacturing sites due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic that leads to lower production post impairment indicators requiring the assessment of the recoverable amount for the said assets.\n\nThe Group estimates the recoverable amount as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use. In determining the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the assets, the Group is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, intangible assets and deferred charges. For goodwill, this requires an estimation of the recoverable amount which is the fair value less costs to sell or value-in-use of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows for the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of cash flows. Further details on property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred charges are disclosed in Notes 10, 30, 11, 12 and 14, respectively.\n\nDetails of the impairment loss recognized are disclosed in Note 24.\n\n## Taxes\n\nUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws and the amount and timing of future taxable profits. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience on previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the entities within the Group.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses can be utilized. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\nFurther details on taxes are disclosed in Note 25.\n\n## Retirement and other employee benefits\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits as well as the present value of defined benefit obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the determination of the discount rates, turnover rates, mortality rates, salary increase rates, and future retirement increases. Due to the complexity of the actuarial valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\n\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The turnover rate represents the proportion of the current plan members who will resign from service prior to their retirement date and hence, be entitled to resignation benefits instead of retirement benefits. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables and is modified accordingly with estimates of mortality improvements. Salary increase rates and future retirement increases are based on expected future inflation rates.\n\nThe Group also estimates other short-term employee benefit obligations and expenses, including the cost of paid leaves based on historical leave availments of employees, subject to the Group's policies. These estimates may vary depending on the future changes in salaries, turn-over rates, mortality rates and actual experiences during the period.\n\nFurther details on retirement and other employee benefits are disclosed in Note 27.",

When goods are shipped or goods are received by the customer, depending on the corresponding agreement with the customers, the amounts recognized as contract assets are reclassified to trade receivables. Payments are received from customers depending on the credit terms.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group did not recognize a provision for expected credit losses on contract assets.\n\nContract liabilities includes short-term advances received to render manufacturing services. The significant decrease in contract liabilities was mainly due to lower advance payments received from new and existing customers towards the end of the year.\n\nThe Group applied the practical expedient in PFRS 15 on the disclosure of information about the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations given the customer contracts have original expected duration of one year or less.\n\n## 8.

Construction in progress transferred to property, plant and equipment amounted to $8.25 million and $16.39 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe Group recognized gains from disposal and retirement of certain property, plant and equipment amounting to $0.66 million in 2020, $0.10 million in 2019, and $0.19 million in 2018 (see Note 24).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cost of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment still being used by the Group amounted to $71.43 million and $75.20 million, respectively.\n\nDepreciation expense included in 'Cost of sales' and 'Operating expenses' accounts follows:\n\n|                              | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Cost of sales (Note 20)      | $34,148,037 | $30,961,361 | $26,080,694 |\n| Operating expenses (Note 21) | 4,010,110   | 4,346,659   | 5,016,589   |\n|                              | $38,158,147 | $35,308,020 | $31,097,283 |\n\nThe Group has no restrictions on its property and equipment and none of these have been pledged as security for its obligations.\n\n## 11. Goodwill\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combinations had been allocated to the following CGUs:\n\n|                | 2020         | 2019         |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| STI            | $58,637,679  | $56,627,517  |\n| VIA            | 48,728,404   | 44,324,971   |\n| STEL           | 38,225,186   | 38,225,186   |\n| Parent Company | 1,097,776    | 1,097,776    |\n| IMI CZ         | 556,049      | 505,801      |\n|                | $147,245,094 | $140,781,251 |\n\nMovement in goodwill follows:\n\n|                                      | 2020         | 2019         |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cost                                 |              |              |\n| At beginning of year                 | $147,684,089 | $147,354,138 |\n| Foreign currency exchange difference | 6,463,843    | 329,951      |\n| At end of year                       | 154,147,932  | 147,684,089  |\n| Accumulated impairment loss          |              |              |\n| At beginning and end of year         | 6,902,838    | 6,902,838    |\n|                                      | $147,245,094 | $140,781,251 |\n\n## STI, VIA, STEL and IMI CZ\n\nThe recoverable amounts of these CGUs have been based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by management covering a five (5)-year period. The pre-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections follows:\n\n|        | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| STI    | 10.11% | 9.47%  |\n| VIA    | 11.45% | 12.78% |\n| STEL   | 12.85% | 12.36% |\n| IMI CZ | 10.60% | 7.90%  |\n\nCash flows beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 1%, which does not exceed the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the global electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry, specifically on automotive, industrial equipment, consumer electronics and telecommunications segments.\n\n## Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations\n\nThe calculations of value-in-use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n\n- \uf0b7 Revenue - Revenue forecasts are management's best estimates considering factors such as industry CAGR, existing customer contracts and projections, historical experiences and other economic factors.\n- \uf0b7 Forecasted gross margins - Gross margins are based on the mix of business model arrangements with the customers.\n- \uf0b7 Overhead and administrative expenses - estimates are based on applicable inflation rates in the respective countries of the cash generating units considering expected future cost efficiencies and production facilities rationalization.\n- \uf0b7 Pre-tax discount rates - Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. This is also the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital.\n\nNo impairment loss was assessed for STI, VIA and IMI CZ in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nFor STEL, the assessment resulted to an impairment loss of $6.90 million in 2018 triggered by slowing growth in the region. The impairment loss is included under 'Miscellaneous income (loss) - net' account in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 24). In 2020 and 2019, despite the weak economy and impact of the pandemic, management assessed that no additional impairment loss should be recognized given the strategies in place to improve the financial performance and lower discount rates.\n\n## Sensitivity to changes in assumptions\n\nWith regard to the assessment of value-in-use of STI, VIA and IMI CZ, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of these CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.\n\n## Parent Company\n\nThe goodwill of the Parent Company pertains to its acquisition of M. Hansson Consulting, Inc. (MHCI) in 2006 and IMI USA in 2005. MHCI was subsequently merged to the Parent Company as testing and development department. IMI USA acts as direct support to the Group's customers by providing program management, customer service, engineering development and prototyping manufacturing services. IMI USA's expertise in product design and development particularly on the flip chip technology is being used across the Group in providing competitive solutions to customers. In 2018, the recoverable amount was based on the market price of the Parent Company's shares at valuation date, less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of the Parent Company's shares represents the value of the Group. In 2020 and 2019 given the volatile market, the Group assessed the impairment based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections of the Parent Company from financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period.\n\nThe comparison of the recoverable amounts and the carrying amounts resulted to no impairment loss in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## 12.

The pretax discount rates applied to cash flow projections range from 10.28% to 10.68%. Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are consistent with those disclosed in Note 11.\n\nSignificant delay in the ramp up of certain projects and declining demand brought by the global automotive downturn resulted to impairment of the related capitalized development cost.

The latest actuarial valuations were made on December 31, 2020.\n\nThe plan is administered by local banks as trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the investment direction of the assets. It defines the investment strategy as often as necessary, at least annually, especially in the case of significant market developments or changes to the structure of the plan participants. When defining the investment strategy, it takes into account the plan's objectives, benefit obligations and risk capacity. The investment strategy is defined in the form of a long-term target structure (investment policy). The Board of Trustees delegates the implementation of the investment policy in accordance with the investment strategy, as well as various principles and objectives to an Investment Committee, which also consists of members of the Board of Trustees, and the Treasurer. The Treasurer oversees the entire investment process.\n\nThe defined benefit plans of the Parent Company and PSi meet the minimum retirement benefit specified under R.A. No. 7641, Retirement Pay Law, while IMI BG is in accordance with the Bulgarian labour legislation and the Collective Labour Contract.\n\nThe Group has net retirement liabilities attributable to the following:\n\n|                | 2020       | 2019       |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| Parent Company | $7,253,561 | $7,549,797 |\n| IMI BG         | 1,751,670  | 1,314,853  |\n| PSi            | 343,258    | 300,432    |\n| Serbia         | 7,166      | -          |\n|                | $9,355,655 | $9,165,082 |",

Fair value is based on the most recent selling price of the club shares.\n\nDerivatives - These pertain to currency forwards hedged by the Group for risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of the currency forwards is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturities as advised by the counterparty to the currency forwards contracts.\n\nFinancial liabilities on put options - These pertain to the liabilities of Cooperatief and IMI UK arising from the written put options over the non-controlling interest of VIA and STI. The fair value of the financial liabilities is estimated using the discounted, probability-weighted cash flow method. The future cash flows were projected using the equity forward pricing formula with reference to the current equity value of the acquiree and the forecasted interest rate which is the risk-free rate in Germany and UK. The riskfree rate used is (0.72%) and 0.17% for VIA and (1.27%) and 0.74% for STI for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management applied weights on the estimated future cash flows, based on management's judgment on the chance that the trigger events for the put options will occur.\n\nThe current equity value of VIA prior to derecognition is determined using the discounted cash flow approach. The future cash flows are projected using the projected revenue growth rate of VIA. The discount rate represents the current market assessment of the risk specific to the acquiree, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been",

The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the acquiree and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital.\n\nFor STI, management used the market approach by approximating the EBITDA multiple taken from comparable companies of STI that are engaged in providing electronics services solutions to derive its current equity value. Management computed EBITDA as the difference of forecasted gross profit and selling and administrative expenses before depreciation and amortization. Another significant assumption is the probability of trigger event occurring within the put option period.\n\nContingent consideration - This pertains to the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of STI determined by discounting the probability weighted payout as estimated by management. The payout is estimated using the projected revenue growth rate of STI. The discount rate is based on the specific circumstances of the acquiree and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital. The contingent liability was fully reversed in 2019.\n\nNoncurrent portion of long-term debt - The fair value of long-term debt is estimated by using the discounted cash flow method using the current incremental borrowing rates for similar borrowings, with maturities consistent with those remaining for the liability being valued. The discount rates used for 2020 and 2019 ranged from 1.67% to 2.33% and from 1.67% to 3.76%, respectively.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe following tables provide the fair value hierarchy of the

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies\n\nThe Group's principal financial instruments, composed of loans payable, long-term debt and other financial liabilities, were issued primarily to raise financing for the Group's operations. The Group has various financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main purpose of the Group's financial instruments is to fund its operational and capital expenditures. The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk. The Group also enters into currency forwards to manage the currency risk arising from its operations and financial instruments.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are summarized below:\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group's policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group's income before income tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. There is no other impact on the Group's equity other than those already affecting income.\n\n|                                   | Effect on Net Loss before Tax   | Effect on Net Loss before Tax   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Increase/Decrease in Basis Points | 2020                            | 2019                            |\n| +100                              | ($734,980)                      | ($1,114,874)                    |\n| -100                              | 734,980                         | 1,114,874                       |",

The Group's exposure to liquidity risk relates primarily to its shortterm and long-term obligations. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity profile to be able to finance its capital expenditures and operations. The Group maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed sufficient to finance its operations. As part of its liquidity risk management, the Group regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flows. To cover financing requirements, the Group intends to use internally-generated funds and loan facilities with local and foreign banks. Surplus funds are placed with reputable banks.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:\n\n|                                               | 2020       | 2020                | 2020            | 2020         | 2020         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                               | On Demand  | Less than  3 Months | 3 to  12 Months | 1 to 5 Years | Total        |\n| Accounts payable and accrued  expenses:       |            |                     |                 |              |              |\n| Trade payables                                | $ -

The Group's major credit risk exposure relates primarily to its holdings of cash and cash equivalents and receivables from customers and other third parties. Credit risk management involves dealing with institutions for which credit limits have been established. The treasury policy sets credit limits for each counterparty. The Group trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. The Group has a well-defined credit policy and established credit procedures. The Group extends credit to its customers consistent with sound credit practices and industry standards. The Group deals only with reputable, competent and reliable customers who pass the Group's credit standards. The credit evaluation reflects the customer's overall credit strength based on key financial and credit characteristics such as financial stability, operations, focus market and trade references. All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.\n\nThe Group defines a financial asset as in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full. Such internal or external information includes discontinuance of orders, financial difficulty or insolvency, probable bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. Actual historical experience shows low defaulted accounts which were also substantially recovered subsequently resulting to insignificant write-offs.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is the carrying amounts of the financial assets. The Group's maximum exposure for cash and cash equivalents excludes the carrying amount of cash on hand.\n\nThe Group has 20% and 25% of trade receivables relating to three major customers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aging analysis of receivables, contract assets and miscellaneous deposits follows:\n\n|                            | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020                                                                      | December 31, 2020         | December 31, 2020         | December 31, 2020         | December 31, 2020         | December 31, 2020                  | December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                            |                     | Neither  Past Due                                                                      | Past Due but not Impaired | Past Due but not Impaired | Past Due but not Impaired | Past Due but not Impaired | Past Due but not Impaired          |                     |\n|                            |                     | nor                                                                                    |                           | 30-60                     | 60-90                     | 90-120                    |                                    | Specifically        |\n|                            | Total               | Impaired                                                                               | <30 Days                  | Days                      | Days                      | Days                      | >120 Days                          | Impaired            |\n| Receivables:               |                     |                                                                                        |                           |                           |                           |                           |                                    |                     |\n| Trade                      | $273,278,729        | $225,019,629  $26,442,860  $10,695,524  $3,153,478  $1,009,684  $5,453,985  $1,503,569 |                           |                           |                           |                           |                                    |                     |\n| Nontrade                   | 2,825,231           | 2,469,447                                                                              | 65,695                    | 66,214                    | 18,250                    | 2,219                     | 55,310                             | 148,096             |\n| Receivable from  insurance | 1,095,700           | -

Credit can proceed with favorable credit terms; can offer term of 15 to maximum of 45 days.\n\nAverage Risk - Credit can proceed normally; can extend term of 15 to maximum of 30 days.\n\nFairly High Risk - Credit could be extended under a confirmed and irrevocable LC and subject to semiannual review for possible upgrade.\n\nHigh Risk - Transaction should be under advance payment or confirmed and irrevocable Stand-By LC; subject to quarterly review for possible upgrade after one year.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nThe Group's foreign exchange risk results primarily from movements of the functional currency of each legal entity against other currencies. As a result of significant transactions denominated in RMB, PHP and EUR the consolidated statements of income can be affected significantly by movements in the USD versus these currencies. In 2020 and 2019, the Group entered into currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nThe Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases denominated in other than the Group's functional currency. Approximately 62% and 61% of the Group's sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 58% and 48% of costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are denominated in currencies other than USD.\n\nThe Group manages its foreign exchange exposure risk by matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.

The reasonably possible change was computed based on one year average historical movement of exchange rates between the USD and other currencies.",

The changes in fair value of currency forwards recognized in 2020 and 2019 amounted to $0.1 million loss and $0.02 million gain, respectively. The changes in fair value of currency forwards are recognized in the consolidated statements of income under 'Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net' account.\n\n## Fair Value Changes on Derivatives\n\nThe net movements in the fair value of the Group's derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow:\n\n|                                         | 2020    | 2019     |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Financial assets:                       |         |          |\n| At beginning of year                    | $5,321  | $3,521   |\n| Fair value of currency forwards         | -       | 15,373   |\n| Fair value of settled instruments       | (5,321) | (13,555) |\n| Foreign currency exchange difference    | -       | (18)     |\n| At end of year                          | $ -     | $5,321   |\n| Financial liabilities:                  |         |          |\n| At beginning of year                    | $ -     | $ -      |\n| Fair value of currency forwards         | 92,122  | -        |\n| Fair value of settled currency forwards | -       | -        |\n| Foreign currency exchange difference    | (3,761) | -        |\n| At end of year                          | $88,361 | $ -      |\n\n## 34. Contingencies\n\nThe Group has various contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary conduct of business which are either pending decision by the courts or being contested. The outcome of these cases is not presently determinable.\n\nThe Group's expanding global activities, while continuing to present a myriad of growth opportunities, also tend to increase its exposure to potential disputes with customers and suppliers. Such exposure could, in turn, directly or indirectly, affect the Group's ability to realize its short and long-term target revenues and operating margins from its services as well as adversely impact its net assets, financial position and results of operations. In this connection, the Group is currently involved in an ongoing arbitration proceeding arising from a contractual dispute with its customer.\n\nIn the opinion of management and its legal counsel, the eventual liability under these lawsuits or claims, if any, will not have a material or adverse effect on the Group's financial position and results of operations. The information usually required by PAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, is not disclosed on the ground that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and assessments.\n\n## 35. Notes to Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nThe Group's noncash investing activities include capitalization by the Group of depreciation related to the development phase of certain projects amounting to nil and $1.57 million for 2020 and 2019,\n\nrespectively. During the year, the Group transferred property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $2.56 million to other noncurrent assets, and licenses to intangible assets amounting to $2.11 million.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities:\n\n|                                    |             | Cash Flows   | Cash Flows                                | Non-cash Changes   | Non-cash Changes                       |    |                                 |                 |                                |                                     |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----|---------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                    | 2019        | Availment    | Settlement/  Payment                      | Reclass            | Addition  Declaration                  |    | Accretion  of interest  expense | Waived  rentals | Foreign  currency  translation | 2020                                |\n| Dividends payable                  | $-          |              | $-  ($6,504,083)                          | $-                 | $-  $6,504,083                         |    | $-                              | $-              | $-                             | $-                                  |\n| Loans payable                      | 126,051,547 | 82,665,635   | (4,974,751)                               | -

Other Matters\n\nCorporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act' or 'CREATE'\n\nOn February 3, 2021, the Bicameral Conference Committee, under the 18th Congress of the Philippines, ratified the reconciled version of the House Bill No. 4157 and Senate Bill No.1357 (the CREATE). Some of the key features of the CREATE bill are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Reduction in current income tax rate from 30% to 25% or 20%, whichever is applicable, effective July 1, 2020;\n- \uf0b7 Reduction of non-deductible interest expense\n- \uf0b7 Effective July 1, 2020 until June 30,2023, the MCIT rate shall be one percent 1%;\n- \uf0b7 Exemption to tax on foreign-sourced dividends received subject to certain conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Imposition of improperly accumulated earnings tax is hereby repealed;\n- \uf0b7 Rationalization of fiscal incentives\n\nAs at February 24, 2021, the harmonized copy of the CREATE bill has been transmitted to the Office of the President for signing or approval into law.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe manufacturing operations of IMI was highly affected by various government mandated lockdowns in China, Philippines and Mexico and voluntary shutdowns in the Europe factories to align with the demand slowdown during the first half of the year. Revenues in the second half of the year recouped, 39% better than first half and 7% higher year-on year on the back of strong demand recovery and subsequent normalization of operations. The global demand for security and I-o-T products boosted industrial revenue while mobility-focused European and North American facilities benefitted from the rapid rise of global automotive production. In addition, IMI's growing foothold in the profitable medical segment also led to increased higher margin sales for its manufacturing plants in Asia.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of the lockdowns, various sites affected obtained approvals to run essential businesses, optimized manpower resources and implemented various cost cutting initiatives. The Group also collaborated with local government units to secure various forms of employee related subsidies as a result of the shutdowns in Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France, Mexico, Serbia, and Singapore. These, along with improved manufacturing efficiency drove improved margins and lower losses compared to last year.\n\nThe effects of potential recurrence of pandemic related shutdowns after the reporting period may pose risks and unfavorable impact to the Company but will not materially affect the Company's ability to continue as going concern.",
