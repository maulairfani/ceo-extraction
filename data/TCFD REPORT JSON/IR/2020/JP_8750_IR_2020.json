I sincerely apologize not only to our policyholders but also to a wider range of our stakeholders.\n\nIn response to the discovery of fraud, Dai-ichi Life has established and built up a system to eradicate the mishandling of cash. In addition, to reform awareness of all executive officers and employees and to prevent a recurrence, we have also launched a company-wide Business Management Quality Reform Task Force. We recognize that the reform of our corporate culture and character cannot be accomplished overnight. However, to regain the trust of our stakeholders and establish a new corporate culture and character, I am taking the lead in each and every initiative.\n\nP17: Overview of Cases of Fraud by Employees of The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited ('Dai-ichi Life') and Status of Response\n\nReview of the Previous Medium-Term Management Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCan you summarize the results of the previous medium-term management plan (MMP), 'CONNECT 2020'?\n\nDuring the three-year period from FY2018 to FY2020, covered by CONNECT 2020, we worked to improve customers' quality of life and to solve social issues. In addition, to fulfill our role as an insurance provider amid the spread of COVID-19, we of course continued to promptly pay insurance claims and provided various services such as applying accidental death benefits to death and severe disability caused by COVID-19, deferring insurance premium payments, and opening consulting services for customers regarding infectious disease. Moreover, we took on the challenge from both growth and discipline aspects by expanding our domestic and overseas business foundations, responding to digitalization, and establishing risk-reduction policies.\n\nWith regard to the quantitative targets, the Group further strengthened its three growth engines, namely the domestic life insurance business, the overseas life insurance business, and the asset management business, in light of changes in the surrounding environment, such as the rapid diversification of\n\n## Group Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Results under 'CONNECT 2020'\n\n|                            | Indicators (Group Based)         | Indicators (Group Based)                  | Objectives and  Goals           |             | FY2018  Results   | FY2019  Results FY2020  Results   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Objectives  (Quantitative) | Accounting  Profit Future Profit | Adjusted  Profit Value of New             | Around \u00a5250bn  (FY2020)         | \u00a5236.3bn    | \u00a5274.5bn          | \u00a5282.8bn                          |\n| Medium- to  Long-term      | (Economic Value)                 | Business                                  | Around \u00a5230bn  (FY2020)         | \u00a5197.4bn    | \u00a5150.3bn          | \u00a5112.6bn                          |\n| Goals                      | Capital  Efficiency Financial    | Average EV  Growth  (ROEV) Solvency Ratio | 8% Average  Growth 170% to 200% | (0.6%) 169% | (2.8%) 195%       | 8.6% (3 year avg.) 203%           |",

As a result, in the initial two years, accounting profit and financial soundness indicators progressed steadily, although future profit and capital efficiency indicators were below targets due to financial market fluctuations.\n\nHowever, in FY2020, the final fiscal year of the plan, we fell far short of our targets for the future profit indicator due to the impact of prolonged low interest rates and self-restraint of sales activities due to the spread of COVID-19 in Japan. On the other hand, as a result of accelerating risk reduction from the perspective of both assets and liabilities, which are not simply extensions of the conventional approach, the financial soundness indicator reached its medium- to long-term goal. In addition, accounting profit and the capital efficiency targets were achieved mainly due to the recovery in the market environment. However, the earnings structure, which is sensitive to financial market fluctuations, remained a challenge.\n\nP25: Group History Since Demutualization\n\n## Our Approach to Stakeholders\n\n## Formulation of a New MMP and Group Vision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Please tell us about the background and intent behind the name of the new MMP, Re-connect 2023.\n\nOur aim, under our new MMP, Re-connect 2023, is to use those three years from FY2021 to FY2023 to steadily realize the reforms we have initiated in response to various changes in the business environment. To this end, all executive officers and employees are expected to share the same values and reinforce their combined efforts. At the same time, we must review our existing approaches to all stakeholders, including policyholders, shareholders, investors, and business partners. 'Re-connect' refers to these powerful ideas.\n\nFor example, with regard to connections with policyholders, there is a growing need for contactless and remote services due to the spread of COVID-19. With the decline in opportunities for face-to-face interaction with customers, Dai-ichi Life's major issue is how to leverage its long-standing strength of face-to-face consulting. Moreover, although Dai-ichi Life says it puts the customer first, customer satisfaction at Dai-ichi Life remains at the middle of the industry\n\n## Re-connect with policyholders\n\nAddress changes in needs and behavior Incorporate medical and digital tech Achieve true customer centricity\n\n## Re-connect with business partners\n\nExpand insurance-related services from a customer perspective Seek collaboration to help resolve social issues\n\nRe-connect\n\nwith employees\n\n- Improve employee engagement and well-being\n\nPromote active participation of\n\ndiverse talent\n\nRe-connect with society and the environment\n\nSecure sustainability\n\nBe eco-friendly and combat\n\nclimate change\n\nRe-connect\n\nwith shareholders\n\nAchieve high capital efficiency\n\nEnhance shareholder payout\n\nlevel. We recognize that further improvement of customer satisfaction, including restoration of trust lost due to the frauds, is a major issue. In addition, we also need to fundamentally reexamine the links between the company and the employees who are responsible for customer contact, including the aforementioned reforms to our corporate culture and character.\n\nThe same applies to our approach to capital markets. Since Dai-ichi Life Holdings was listed on the stock market, our stock price has not gone above a relatively low market valuation. One of the main factors behind this is the high cost of capital, which is attributable to the large amount of market risk to cover high assumed rate of return on legacy policies. I believe it is necessary to have firm resolution to formulate countermeasures to address this issue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How do you view the relationship of your business with society and the environment?\n\nAs we aim to re-connect with a diverse range of stakeholders through our business, being in harmony with society and the environment is indispensable. The economic growth model that has supported the development of humanity to date has become unsustainable globally, and it has brought about various social issues as shown in the SDGs, such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and social fragmentation due to economic\n\ndisparities. In addition, movements are emerging around the world to actively work on resolving these social issues and realizing a sustainable future society.\n\nThis awareness and these actions are particularly noticeable among the millennial and the Generation Z, who were born in the 1980s and later. While they play a central role in consumption and production, they are highly conscious of global sustainability, and great many of them think from this perspective about the products they purchase and the companies they work for. Amid these changes in social awareness, it is important for a company to be recognized as a company that contributes to both social and environmental sustainability. In addition, thorough transparency of business management is also necessary for this.\n\nAs French writer Saint-Exup\u00e9ry said, 'We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children,' I myself strongly believe that we must not pass the cost of our growth on to our children's generations. When formulating the new MMP, we backcasted from the desired future of a sustainable society, which is the foundation of our business, and clearly stated that we will extend our efforts, more than ever before, to resolve material issues relating to the sustainability of society and the global environment.\n\nP19: Value Creation Process\n\nP27: New Medium-Term Management Plan Overview of Re-connect 2023\n\n## New Group Vision Protect and improve the well-being of all\n\nAs a lifetime partner, we safeguard and contribute to the peace of mind, prosperity and wellness of all the people we serve.\n\n## Our Material Issues (Materiality)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you explain the background and intent behind the formulation of the new Group Vision?\n\nIn the previous MMP, we stated that through business development we should aim for improving people's quality of life. To redefine the term in a way that can resonate with as many people as possible, the new group vision of 'Protect and improve the well-being of all' was decided during repeated discussions on the formulation of the new MMP from June last year.\n\nHere the 'well-being' refers to the total value we provide, such as peace of mind, wealth, and health. It also means 'to live a safe, prosperous, and healthy life, and to be in a happy state.' In this sense, I believe well-being is consistent with our desire to contribute to the happiness sought by each of our customers.\n\n'Protect and improve' also embodies our desire to stand by our customers' side even more than in the past. Our group has an enormous amount of medical data and knowledge accumulated through many years of experience, in addition to strengths such as diverse customer contact points in nine countries, including Japan. Based on this new Group vision, we will leverage our Group strengths to contribute to the well-being of all people and the realization of a sustainable society.\n\n## P5: Group Mission / Contents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What would be your focus points for business development?\n\nUnder the previous MMP, we captured business domains by sales channel, which is the business partner of each operating company. In other words, we formulated business plans from the perspective of the insurance provider, that is to say, how to\n\ndevelop products and services for customers at the end of each sales channel. In the new plan, we changed our approach to classifying our business domains based on customer value (= experiential value), which is a major difference from the past. Going forward, we will consider our business strategy from the perspective of how to increase each experiential value.\n\nThe first experiential value is protection. While the social importance of private protection is increasing because the Japanese public security system by itself has limitations as a preparation for unexpected events. Nevertheless, insurance coverage among young people remains low. Elimination of this protection gap (the difference between the protection needed\n\n## Life insurance coverage among population in 20s\n\nSource: \"Survey on Life Insurance Coverage,\" Japan Institute of Life Insurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Business Domains to Expand and Explore\n\nPromote various business partnerships in the 'enhancing connections' domain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the actual protection amount) is a major issue, particularly among the younger generation\n\n## P33: Protection\n\nThe second is asset formation/succession. While the low interest rate environment continues globally, average life expectancy is growing, and concern about securing funds for life in old age is heightening in this so-called 'the 100-year life era.' To prepare for this longevity risk, so to speak, providing a solid means of asset management is also an important mission.\n\n## P35: Asset Formation/Succession\n\nThe third is health and medical care. Medical technology has evolved, but the gap between average life expectancy and healthy life span has not narrowed. Our mission is also to do as much as possible to contribute to enhancing the life span of our customers during which they are healthy and self-reliant, that is, to extend the healthy life span.\n\n## P37: Health and Medical Care\n\nThe last is enhancing connections. Amid changes in the social structure, such as the increasing number of nuclear families and the rapid increase in single-person households, the power of approximately 40,000 sales representatives spreading across approximately 1,300 offices in Japan is enormous when creating bonds and ties with local communities. In particular, I believe that social ties and human connections are fundamental conditions for achieving well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you also share your approach to the business portfolio?\n\nIn terms of our business portfolio strategy, I think that promoting ambidextrous management, management that combines expanding and exploring, in accordance with the growth stage and maturity of each business is fundamental.\n\nIn terms of expanding, we will pursue providing the best experiential value, particularly in mature domestic businesses. And we have a CX Design Strategy that will be at the heart of this effort. We recognize that not only rational values, such as the functions and prices of products and services, but also the marketing concept of customer experience (CX) that emphasizes emotional value in each phase, such as prior to purchase, using the product or service, and follow-up after purchase, is important in the life insurance.\n\nRational values are easy to commoditize. In particular, millennials and younger generations, also called digital natives, make full use of digital technologies to collect information from the internet and other sources when purchasing goods. These changes in consumer behavior have eliminated the past asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers, and the commoditization of products is proceeding in a variety of industries.\n\nLife insurance is no exception. Originally, life insurance was an area in which asymmetry of information existed\n\nbecause of products that require complex expertise, but it is now becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate ourselves simply by providing rational values. The CX Design Strategy aims to boost and differentiate the overall value of the customer experience by adding emotional value to the conventional rational values. By delivering experiences and impressions that exceed expectations at all customer contact points, we will increase the number of fans and lead to business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you share with us a little more about the CX Design Strategy?\n\nIt may seem like something new when you hear the term CX but, in fact, life insurance a customer signs up for is the result of various CX. For example, each of Total Life Plan Designers at Dai-ichi Life have met with customers and encourage them to think about things that are rarely thought about in their daily life, such as unlikely tragic events and longevity risk. This delivers emotional value and builds trust with the customer, and then Daiichi Life has built its corporate brand. However, the way we have done this work to date has inherent limitations:  the quality and level of value delivered to our customers depends very much on the experience and skill of the individual sales representative.\n\nThe CX Design Strategy aims to provide unprecedented experiential value by establishing online customer contact points and merging the conventional 'offline' (the physical, face-to-face channel), one of our strengths, with it. While being constantly connected with customers online to provide experiential value on a daily basis, we will leverage our offline strengths at important points, such as consulting on life plan design and final confirmation. In this way, we will realize our Group-wide concept of Online Merges with Offline (OMO), which will enable us to provide what customers want, when they want it in a natural manner.\n\nThe foundation of this strategy will be a CX Design System. This system will unify the vast amount of information assets dispersed within the Group, and then accumulate and analyze a variety of unstructured data*, such as customer preferences and behavior. In addition, we will integrate the products and service menus traditionally been provided separately by each group company, or by each customer contact point, such as sales representatives and contact centers, into a single communication interface. We anticipate expanding functionality after the system becomes operational, and adding products and services of domestic group companies and content of business partners as needed.\n\n## P29: CX Design Strategy\n\n*  We aim to act from the customer's point of view and deliver experiential values that exceeds expectations. We will do this by accumulating and analyzing data about the customer's preferences and behavior, or reflecting the comments as received from the customer at various contact points, not just customer data accumulated to maintain and manage the insurance contract such as age and family composition. This will be done to deepen our understanding of our customers going forward.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Other than the CX Design Strategy, how will you utilize digital technology?\n\nA major feature of digital technology is that it facilitates quick adaptation to diverse needs. In this sense, digitalization will become a catalyst that will cause a variety of changes in the game.\n\nIn April 2021, the Dai-ichi Smart Small-amount and Short-term Insurance Company, Limited, a completely online insurance company, commenced operations as our fourth domestic insurance vehicle. This company has launched a new product called 'Special Infectious Diseases Insurance,' which covers COVID-19 and other diseases. Premiums for this product are adjusted every 3 months depending on the prevalence of infectious diseases. Such agile adjustments were unthinkable for Dai-ichi Life products, but new entity can respond quickly without significant costs as a digitally integrated company, and therefore, it is possible to offer the product broadly through online tie-ups with various companies.\n\nAs in this case, through digitalization it will become possible for businesses to respond in a finely tuned manner that could not have been realized until now. In addition, the use of AI enables us to forecast future healthcare costs and enhance our ability to underwrite insurance for people suffering from specific diseases based on the analysis of past data. As such, I anticipate that digitalization will become an important tool for changing the game.\n\nBased on this belief, we have positioned digitalization, including investment in human capital with data science and related expertise, as one of the priority investment areas in our new MMP, too. In addition to actively developing human capital internally and recruiting mid-career specialists with immediately deployable capabilities, we will actively develop collaborations with external players with skills and capabilities in the digitalization area that are not available in our Group, such as the collaboration with DeNA we announced in June.\n\nP31: Feature: Exploring the acquisition of new organizational capability\n\nCurrently, customer acceptance of remote communication is increasing due to the spread of COVID-19, and the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenvironment is conducive to advancing service transformation through digitalization, so we intend to further accelerate it.\n\nP43: Driving Innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What kind of initiatives will you pursue in the area of 'exploring' for growth?\n\nTo realize sustainable growth as a Group, we will focus on 'exploration' aimed at augmenting our business domains in parallel with 'expansion' of existing core businesses. Specifically, we are strengthening our efforts to develop new products and services in the domains of health and medical care and asset formation/succession. We do not intend to proceed with all of these efforts on our own. Our policy is to enhance innovative organizational capabilities by making flexible use of various ways of doing business based on circumstances, such as collaborating with external companies and key experts who have unique knowledge, know-how and strengths in each area, or strengthening investments in such companies.\n\nBased on this thought, we have established an organizational unit within the Group with the mission of fostering innovation. At the same time, we are further strengthening our efforts to identify domestic and overseas startups, develop systems for strategic investment in such companies, and collaborate with organizations and institutions that have specialized knowledge and ideas. As a result of our exploration to date, we have launched new businesses that contribute to solving social issues, such as Healstep (pronounced 'HealthStep'), a service that helps health insurance associations to streamline and control healthcare costs, and a health support app by our group company QOLead, which provides healthcare services.\n\nP38: Feature: Medical cost control support service for health insurance associations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How will you enhance the customer's experiential value?\n\nIn enhancing the customer's experiential value, the most important thing is to take the customer's perspective. In this sense, I think we need to be keenly aware of the Group's brand message: people first. This brand message was established at the time of demutualization in 2010, and I feel that it is really the time to think deeply about what this means.\n\nThe more experience people, including myself, accumulate, the more reflexive their judgments and actions regarding things become. Based on one's past experiences, people tend to think and act without thinking deeply, and just think 'this is done this way.' However, to create new value, it is important to stop and think again. I often use the phrase 'know your customer as your customer knows himself/herself,' referring to the importance of putting yourself in your customer's shoes. This is not limited to employees in the sales department, but is required of all employees. Each employee should be able to\n\nprovide the best experiential value by not only enhancing the expertise of each division, but also by putting themselves in the customer's shoes.\n\nNow that individual values are becoming increasingly diverse, if we collect data and continue to manage by taking averages, there is the risk that, we will only be able to provide products and services that do not resonate with anyone. We cannot provide products and services that resonate with customer without truly putting on the customer's shoes, which is to say, without sincerely thinking 'people first.' The importance of thinking from the viewpoint of the other person is the same for the colleagues and business partners we work with. Respecting diversity and accepting diverse values is a requirement for corporate growth.\n\nIn this age, when forecasting is becoming difficult , and diverse values and needs are existing, there will be a decisive difference between a company that thinks seriously and thoroughly about each customer and a company that does not. Our entire group will work together to be sincerely and truly a company that thinks 'people first.'\n\nIn addition, we believe that changing management values from a focus on quantity to an emphasis on quality is an important point to enhance experiential value. We will change our conventional mindset, which is focused on new business volume, the number of new Total Life Plan Designers and other quantitative factors, and once again be keenly aware that customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal we should pursue. Of course, the pursuit of quantitative goals is important for corporate growth, but it must come after the quality, and that order must not be changed.\n\nIn the digital age, quantity may increase discontinuously as quality improves. That's exactly what the CX Design Strategy aims for. If we improve the quality of the experiential value we provide and customers recognize and highly evaluate it, then sales volume should increase by itself. Going forward, what can be done by utilizing digital tools will be handled by digital tools, and people will focus on refining four experiential values and thoroughly improve quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow do you evaluate the current state of overseas operations and what future developments can we expect?\n\nIn FY2020 our overseas operations had temporary difficulties due to the impact of COVID-19, but each company is working to return to a growth trajectory.\n\nAt Protective in the U.S., we sought to improve customer convenience through online insurance claims settlement and other means, while acquiring an insurance company that handles non-life insurance and distributes its products and services under the Revolos brand. In addition, the strengthening of our business foundation continued even amid spread of COVID-19, as evidenced by the full-scale contribution of profits from the Great West insurance policies that we acquired in the past. At TAL in Australia, the surrender and lapse rates were favorable and new business remained solid. Although there was a\n\ndeterioration in insurance revenue at some group insurance policies, the impact was limited and insurance premium rates were upwardly revised in the second half of the fiscal year. Also, companies operating in emerging markets in Asia are moving forward with digitalization and working to ensure and improve customer convenience amid the spread of COVID-19.\n\nP41: Feature: Utilization of digital technologies in the Group\n\nUnder the new MMP, we will continue to position the overseas business as the driver of the Group's growth. We will assess the growth stages of our business in each market and promote portfolio strategies accordingly. We will pursue sustainable earnings growth and capital efficiency in excess of cost of capital by simultaneously pursuing 3 basic strategies in a balanced manner: 1) stable growth and contributions to earnings at an early stage is expected from the U.S. and Australian businesses; 2) expanding business in emerging Asian markets which are expected to have high growth and contribution to earnings over the medium- to long-term and super-long-term; and 3) incorporating innovative business models in preparation for future changes in the competitive environment.\n\nAt the same time, we will accelerate the establishment of a global management framework. Through the Global Leaders Committee (GLC), which is composed of the management of overseas companies and Japanese executive officers mostly from Dai-ichi Life Holdings, we will support the evolution of overseas Group companies so that they can participate in group management more proactively, which will lead to the utilization of global expertise and the sophistication of management.\n\nP39: Overseas Business Strategy\n\n## Strengthening Human Capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCan you talk about your measures to develop human capital?\n\nAmid the increasingly rapid changes in the business environment, we believe that human capital is the most important management resource for transforming the company in response to these changes. To support customers' well-being and give them a valuable customer experience, it is a prerequisite to secure the well-being of each and every employee who acts in that role. I believe that we should be a company where all employees can feel that they are working in fulfilling jobs, which in turn leads to their own growth.\n\nDai-ichi Life's Employee Satisfaction (ES) survey shows that back-office employees and Total Life Plan Designers say that too often present tasks cannot be handled with their current knowledge and experience alone. It shows that there are not a few employees suffering from a burden of work due to lacking knowledge and experience. To address this issue, in addition to career support and cross-organizational cooperation systems, we plan to expand our flexible training system utilizing online methods. We will also focus on promoting diversity and inclusion,",

Furthermore, in line with the promotion of the CX Design Strategy, we will promote operational efficiency through the use of digital technologies and position human capital in ways that will lead to expanding opportunities for individual growth and maximizing capabilities. I believe that there is absolutely nothing one can't overcome if he/ she has the desire and courage to try a new job.\n\n## P63: Human Capital Management Strategies P66: Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThrough these initiatives, we will create an environment in which employees can work energetically, connect with colleagues, and share knowledge and ideas to create synergies. By doing so, we will ensure the well-being of each and every employee and connect this to realizing customers' well-being. At the same time, under the new Group Vision, we will drastically reform our corporate culture to foster a new organizational atmosphere in which all employees can unite. We recognize that we cannot strengthen and reform our corporate culture and human capital overnight, but we are going to tackle this task with determination.\n\n## Financial Strategies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you also tell us about your financial and capital strategies?\n\nSince our listing in 2010, we have successfully implemented a number of growth strategies, primarily overseas expansion, under an Enterprise Risk Management framework. However, our current stock price is not necessarily at a satisfactory level. When viewed in terms of stock price, we are not highly regarded by our shareholders and investors, and as top management I take this fact seriously.\n\nGiven the high market sensitivity of our stock price and other factors, we recognize that the cost of capital expected by the market has risen from 8% at the time of our listing to 10% currently. In light of this, in the new MMP we aim to grow earnings by raising capital efficiency, rather than simply increasing profits. The ultimate goal is to break away from an undervalued stock price by stably achieving capital productivity that exceeds the cost of capital. To this end, we will accelerate risk-reduction initiatives, revamp shareholder payout policies, and improve the level of IR disclosures and our dialogue with the market.\n\nTo build a financial position that is less sensitive to market fluctuations, it is necessary to reduce the ratio of equity holdings, which are subject to large price fluctuations. On the other hand, there is also the problem that, for example, domestic government bonds alone do not generate sufficient returns to cover the high assumed rate of return. To address this issue, we have recently been implementing structural reforms on the liability side by ceding the block of legacy policies with high assumed rate of return, to outside reinsurance companies. The reform takes time because of the terms and conditions of the reinsurance transactions, but through this measure we are accelerating the\n\nresolution of this issue.\n\nI definitely want to achieve capital productivity in excess of the cost of capital. I hope that our decision to repurchase up to 200-billion-yen worth of shares, announced in March 2021, shows the capital market my commitment to financial transformation. Of course, we will not be able to achieve sustainable profit growth if we do not make our business itself a growth model. To this end, we will firmly implement the various measures outlined in our MMP.\n\nP45: Capital Management Policies and ERM\n\n## Initiatives for Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can you explain your sustainability initiatives?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the new MMP positions achieving harmony with society and the environment as a major premise of our business activities. Until now, our Group has participated in various initiatives aimed at ensuring the sustainability of society, starting with climate change countermeasures. We have not only contributed to resolving social issues as a corporate citizen, but also actively promoted contributions through ESG investments as an institutional investor.\n\nWe believe that it is not against our fiduciary responsibility to use the insurance premiums that policyholders pay for the benefit of the next generation, their children, for investment that contributes to the realization of a sustainable society. Going forward, not as an enforced obligation, but as our business' intent, we will continue and further expand our investment in companies and businesses that contribute to the realization of a sustainable society, such as investments that promote the realization of a decarbonized society and the utilization of renewable energy.\n\n## P59: Feature: ESG Investment by Dai-ichi Life\n\nAs part of this effort, Dai-ichi Life became the first Asian institutional investor to join the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance in February 2021. The Alliance is an international initiative of institutional investors with the shared goal of shifting to a portfolio of net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Based on the guidelines published by the alliance, the Group set an high goal of 25% reduction of CO2 emissions  from publicly traded equities, corporate bonds, and real estate investees by 2025, compared to the end of March 2020.\n\n## P53: Climate Change Initiatives - Response to TCFD\n\nGroup-wide efforts as well as a super-long-term perspective are important for sustainability issues. Previously, Dai-ichi Life, the Group's core operating company, was the focus of our activities. From now on, we intend to develop initiatives that are unique and involve domestic and overseas Group companies, with our eyes set on a sustainable society 100 years from now, from the 3 perspectives of initiatives in asset management, initiatives through the core life insurance business,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand initiatives by employees. To this end, it is important to foster the awareness of the approximately 70,000 people in the Group and change their behavior. At a meeting held in April, the CEOs of Group companies gathered together, and I gave the message: 'Let's get everyone with the same awareness of sustainability.' While Group company CEOs already have a very high level of awareness, going forward we intend to roll out initiatives with a greater sense of unity, such as by setting common Group targets.\n\nP51: Sustainability\n\n## To Our Stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinally, do you have any message for stakeholders?\n\nWhen launching a new initiative, there is always the opinion that if one thing is started, something else isn't started. There have often been discussions about such trade-offs in the management of our group as well. For example, 'if we seek only quality, volume will decline,' or 'we have to sacrifice the present to gain in future,' or 'which stakeholder's interest do we pursue, this one or that one?' However, I am worried that we will not move forward as long as we keep thinking about such trade-offs. Climate change and other environmental issues are definitely problems for us who are alive now. The concept of Creating Shared Value (CSV), which pursues economic value and social value simultaneously, is becoming the mainstream of corporate management.\n\nFor the younger generation, in particular, 'trade-off' is becoming a kind of unacceptable word, a word they cannot identify with. Many of them are strongly committed to 'trade-on' values, those of sharing abilities and money, such as crowdfunding, charity and fundraising activities, and volunteering, in order to build a better future. Likewise, I believe that insurance is the ultimate sharing business, and it is important for us to have the younger generations empathize with\n\nus by having highly transparent management.\n\nTrade-on values are also consistent with the recent concept of 'stakeholder capitalism.' We believe that all of the stakeholders around a company, such as customers, shareholders and investors, business partners, and employees, are communities that are indispensable to us. Under the new MMP, we will strengthen our connections with all of our stakeholders without trading off the interests of one stakeholder for the benefit of another.\n\nThe name of Japan's new era, Reiwa, means beautiful harmony. Sustainable corporate management truly means aiming for beautiful harmony with all stakeholders. I think this is the foundation of management strategy in the Reiwa era. But, the 'optimal balance' for achieving beautiful harmony cannot be solved with a simple equation. The optimal balance changes dynamically depending on the trends of the times and the state of the corporation, and pursuing the solution is an endless journey. However, I believe that this is the essence of corporate management.\n\nIn the spring of this year, we conducted a survey of all Dai-ichi Life employees and received responses from 43,000 of our approximately 55,000 employees. Partly due to the discovery of fraud, many comments in the free opinion field were tough, such as 'connections across divisions are weak,' 'communication with executive officers and general managers is bad,' and 'it is difficult to give feedback to top sales representatives.' On the other hand, about 90% of our employees expressed their understanding of the Group's philosophy of 'customer first', 'By your side, for life' and 'The best rather than the largest.' That is very encouraging for me, and I am renewing my determination to push forward with gradual reforms, tenaciously, to meet their hopes and expectations.\n\nWe will continue to engage in dialogue with all of our stakeholders, and the entire management team will continue to take on challenges while receiving a variety of opinions and advice. I look forward to your continued and wholehearted support.",

We would like to express our sincere apologies for the inconvenience and concern caused to the affected customers, policyholders, shareholders and other stakeholders. As a financial institution and a life insurance company, we take very seriously the fact that we have caused a series of frauds and have shaken the confidence in our life insurance business. In order to eradicate frauds, we, the holding company will continue to monitor the status of Dai-ichi Life's efforts to improve and enhance its systems, and will strive to regain the trust of the public.\n\n## 1.

Measures to Prevent Recurrence\n\nIn order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, to regain the trust of customers and other stakeholders, and to establish a new corporate culture, Dai-ichi Life has launched the Business Management Quality Reform Task Force led by the President, and is implementing the following three main initiatives.\n\n## (1) General Inspection to Ensure That There Are no Similar Frauds\n\nDai-ichi Life will continue a general inspection to sincerely address the affected customers as a company and conduct a comprehensive check to see if there are any other similar cases of financial damage.\n\n- \u00b7  In fiscal 2020, based on the incidents that have occurred to date, it first focused on confirming high-risk contracts with the potential for similar tactics, and have completed confirmation through individual notices and outbound calls for a total of approximately 610,000 contracts with outstanding policyholder loans, etc.\n- \u00b7  In fiscal 2021, for the purpose of alerting customers and ensuring comprehensiveness, it expanded the scope of risk-focused confirmation to include contracts with no withdrawal history but a certain amount can be withdrawn, and have completed investigations for approximately 670,000 contracts.\n- \u00b7  In addition, from May 2021, in order to confirm all policyholders, it has enclosed a notice in the Total Life Plan Report asking for confirmation and reminding policyholders. It is planning to complete the confirmation and reminder of 8 million cases by December by enclosing a notice in the Total Life Plan Report.\n\n## (2) Improvement and Enhancement of the System to Eradicate Fraud (to be Implemented in Fiscal 2020)\n\nDai-ichi Life recognizes that there are multiple causes for the occurrence of the series of incidents, and is implementing the following measures to prevent recurrence for each of them.\n\n## (1) Inadequate system to uniformly prohibit direct money transfers from customers\n\n- \u00b7  Establish administrative procedures that prohibit its employees from receiving money directly from customers \u00b7  Confirmation that no money is received through compliance checks and daily self-checks\n\n## (2) Insufficient reminders that employees cannot handle cash, etc.\n\n- \u00b7  In addition to the confirmation in the Total Life Plan Report, indication on the Dai-ichi Life's website and on the forms for requesting various types of withdrawals that 'our employees cannot directly receive money from customers'\n- \u00b7  Addition of a new question to the customer questionnaire that is filled in during procedures that asks customers to understand that there is no direct transfer of money from customers to employees of Dai-ichi Life\n\n## (3) Insufficient confirmation of the status of daily activities and understanding of predictive signs\n\n- \u00b7   In addition to establishing a new organization to collect and analyze information related to compliance risks, expansion of the scope of monitoring that was previously conducted\n- \u00b7  In order to establish a method to monitor the status of business activities of all sales representatives in a timely manner, take measures to introduce a system that enables the timely monitoring and management of sales representatives activities\n\n## Strengthening of the three-line defense at Dai-ichi Life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrengthen communication and information coordination\n\nThrough these efforts, Dai-ichi Life will further improve and enhance its internal control system to eradicate fraud (by reinforcing the autonomous risk control functions of business units and the check-and-balance functions of the compliance and internal audit divisions) and strengthen its three-line defense. The Company, as the holding company, will also closely monitor the efforts of Dai-ichi Life to address these issues and the status of improvement based on the opinions and advice of external experts and internal investigations, and will duly recognize the existence of issues in the operation of the internal control system for the management of the entire Group and will manage them appropriately.\n\n## (3) Reform of the Corporate Culture and Structure that Led to the Fraud\n\nIn the background of the series of fraud cases, Dai-ichi Life recognizes that there were problems with the corporate culture and structure itself, such as the fostering of a sense of privilege among sales representatives who handle the contracts of many customers, and the sense of reticence among its employees toward the top performers. Accordingly, in order to drastically reform these issues, it has started the following initiatives.\n\n## (1) Implementation of questionnaire for all employees\n\nIn January 2021, Dai-ichi Life conducted a questionnaire for all employees regarding the issues and ideal state of the organization. The issues identified in the questionnaire are also used in town hall meetings.\n\n## (2) Holding town hall meetings (dialogue between management and employees)\n\nStarting in May 2021, Dai-ichi Life plans to hold a total of 56 town hall meetings with the management team for all employees. These meetings provide an opportunity to engage in open and frank dialogue and gather opinions on such issues as whether the corporate culture is diverging from the common sense of the world and whether there are any points where it is inward-looking rather than customer-oriented.\n\nDai-ichi Life recognizes that reforming the corporate culture and structure is not something that can be accomplished overnight, but requires a long-lasting effort. In the future, it will continue to implement and realize each of the initiatives in the Business Management Quality Reform Task Force, and take continuous action from a medium-to long-term perspective while implementing the PDCA cycle.\n\n## 3. Approach to Management Responsibility\n\nIn each of the cases, while one of the causes was the actors' lack of awareness of ethics and compliance with laws and regulations, we also believe that the systems in place were insufficient to prevent damage to customers, including insufficient rules on money transfers and inadequate management and supervision of sales representatives.\n\nTo investigate the cause of the Yamaguchi Prefecture case and to determine the responsibility of the officers and employees, Dai-ichi Life had the case investigated and assessed by an external lawyer who has no vested interest in the Group, in order to ensure the perspective of a third party. In addition, the Audit and Supervisory Board of Dai-ichi Life and the Audit & Supervisory Committee of the Company, for which the majority of the members are outside members/directors, monitor in detail the appropriateness of the investigation and evaluation processes conducted by the executive officers and the relevant outside lawyers.\n\nBased on these results, the responsibilities of the executive officers in charge of the divisions were clarified and their remuneration is reduced, and executive officers, including the Chairman and President, voluntarily returned their remuneration. In addition, Dai-ichi Life and the Company's current executive officers and above are also taking this matter seriously and will reduce their remuneration uniformly.",

In this sense, we believe that the expected role for life insurance will become increasingly large. And value differentiation based only on high-quality products and services is becoming difficult amid such social trends as increasingly diversifying customer values and behavior, rise of the digital-native generation, and growing influence of information communicated over social media.\n\nIn the coming era, we believe it will be necessary to focus\n\n## External environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowing awareness of preparedness for the future amid the spread of COVID-19 and other factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiversifying customer values\n\n## What does 'CX' refer to?\n\nWe define 'CX' as the psychological and emotional value that customers experience through all points of contact with Dai-ichi Life Group. Focusing on CX enables us to address the improvement of value received by customers that goes beyond enhancing the value of products and services. It also leads to the identification and improvement of CX issues that could jeopardize the value of those products and services.\n\nSource of diagram: 'CX strategy: Experience value management that links to the customer's mind' by Tetsuo Tanaka, Nomura Research Institute.

By having our customers routinely experience this experiential values and emotions that exceed their expectations, we will increase fans of Dai-ichi Life Group that would lead to our sustainable growth. That is the state that we seek to realize under our CX Design Strategy. Our 'CX Design System,' which we are currently building with the aim to launch in fiscal 2022, is what will form the foundation of that strategy. This system will offer informative content related to four experiential values and an interface enabling communication with our customers. After launching the system, we will continue to successively enhance\n\nits functionality, expanding the value with non-insurance related content from our business partners in addition to content on insurance products and services from our domestic Group companies. Additionally, through diverse customer contact points over physical and digital platforms, we will deepen our understanding of each customer while utilizing technology to provide an optimal, high-quality CX as we move forward. Through our CX Design System, while leveraging the strengths of our 'offline' face-to-face channels, we will proceed to unite our customer contact points by fusing those channels with their 'online' counterparts, and realize a form of 'OMO' (Online Merges with Offline) that enables our customers to use what they want, when they want it in a natural manner.\n\n## CX Design Strategy Process\n\nDiverse, high-quality products and services\n\nHaving more customers\n\nexperience our products and services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeeper understanding of customers through various contact points\n\nDelivering experiences that exceed customer expectations at all contact points\n\nCombined, it becomes accumulative value leading to the growth of Dai-ichi Life Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Childbirth) Review insurance\n\nFans of Dai-ichi Life Group\n\nincrease\n\nLinking to the growth of\n\nthe Company\n\n<!-- image -->",

We sat down with Sho Segawa, Executive Officer and Deputy Head of the Healthcare Business Unit at DeNA, and Kentaro Tanaka from our Marketing Strategy Unit to discuss the background of our recent partnership and future prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Offering customers experiences that exceed their expectations through a fusion of face-toface and digital channels\n\nTanaka: While we had a connection with DeNA from before, it became deeper through the 'Blue Star Project' that aimed to improve the rate of women undergoing cervical cancer examinations. Dai-ichi Life joined this project, which was being executed by DeNA and Roche Diagnostics K.K., in 2020. Given the fact that Dai-ichi Life Group endeavors to improve the quality of life of its customers, we felt a strong resonance with DeNA's corporate philosophy of 'We delight people beyond their wildest dreams' and its position on social issues, and become a project sponsor.\n\nSegawa: Originally, DeNA grew rapidly as a result of its games business. In recent years, however, we have also been focused on reinforcing our businesses that lead to the resolution of social issues. In line with that, it has become increasingly important for us to expand our points of contact in physical\n\ndomains in addition to our preexisting virtual domains. Under the 'Blue Star Project,' by collaborating with members of different businesses with face-to-face contact points such as Dai-ichi Life, we had positive outcomes such as an increase in followers on our official social media accounts and higher awareness of cervical cancer examinations. I myself have a first-hand sense of how a fusion of online and offline channels enables the provision of high value-added.\n\nTanaka: Under the medium-term management plan of Dai-ichi Life Group, we cited the resolution of various issues to realize a sustainable society and contribute to the well-being of all as our goal, and aim to expand our business domains beyond insurance. A key initiative forming a part of that process is 'the fusion of face-to-face and digital' capabilities. By building modern-day service processes, we intend to provide experiences and emotions that exceed expectations at all customer contact points, and contribute to the realization of people's well-being. To that end, we need to think through what 'true customer expectations' are completely from the\n\ncustomer's perspective. At DeNA as a corporation that has engaged in the repeated development of services from a user standpoint, we would relish the opportunity to study their stance and expertise in that regard.\n\nSegawa: Our strength lies in utilizing internet and AI to bring delight to each one of our customers. Similarly, my impression of Dai-ichi Life is that it utilizes digital platforms more than any other insurance company. Given that, if we can be of service to Dai-ichi Life, I believe that it would be in the area of user 'retention' rather than digital technology. Over time, through developing a diverse array of businesses such as entertainment, sports, live streaming and healthcare, we have accumulated know-how in the area of 'engagement science,' which is retaining customers and compelling them to continue using our services with joy. We have expertise in triggering changes in user behavior by compelling them to continue using something because they find it to be interesting. If we can leverage that, I feel that we will be able to establish an ongoing connection between Dai-ichi Life and each of their customer.\n\n## Contributing to the resolution of social issues in a delightful way\n\nTanaka: As the first initiative of  our business partnership, we will begin offering two services for women in fall  2021: a community service called 'Haretoke' and an app that assists with healthy dieting called 'Karadamo.' As the majority of employees in Dai-ichi Life Group are women, we have focused on establishing a workplace environment where women can successfully contribute and on developing female leaders. Today, however, the work-life balance and career plan sought by individual employees is becoming increasingly diverse, and such shifts are widely visible not just in Dai-ichi Life Group, but\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunching two services that support working women in fall 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nelsewhere as well. Given that, we intend on establishing 'supporting working women' as our initial theme and promoting female employees empowerment, a social issue that needs to be addressed to realize a sustainable society.\n\nSegawa: In developing services, we are mindful of working women's ability to discover 'a sense of themselves' within the limited amount of time that they have. While there are plenty of services that target women, the majority of such existing services are unable to fully meet the needs of working women. A common example is a service accompanied with incentive such as a free cup of coffee. Most women would prefer confectionaries over coffee in such a case. 'Services that reflect me' are an accumulation of insights about users. In fact, that is where our true strength lies. While retention rates for services may not be that high at first, we are adept at boosting those rates by analyzing facts and refining services. That is why KPIs invariably improve a year after launching services. We are confident in that area.\n\nTanaka: The strength of Dai-ichi Life Group is our face-to-face channels accompanied by human warmth. Our Total Life Plan Designers, which is approximately 40,000 nationwide, even have knowledge of what our customers' pets' names are and whether they prefer coffee or tea. At the same time, our ability to reach the entire population of Japan through these methods is questionable. By working together with DeNA, we seek to realize connections with a wider user population, including millennials and members of Generation Z, and deliver 'experiential values' in both the insurance and non-insurance domains. Additionally, while the insurance business till now has leaned towards 'turning a negative into zero (by covering insurance losses),' I believe that going forward, initiatives for boosting value by 'turning zero into a positive value' will have a greater importance.\n\nSegawa: The phrase 'resolving social issues' itself carries a negative image in the form of 'turning a negative into zero.' We at DeNA also seek to contribute to resolve social issues in a more positive, enjoyable and delightful fashion. With regard to healthcare as well, rather than taking the approach that our super-graying society and accompanying rise in medical costs are presenting difficulties, we are adopting initiatives that enable people to become healthy while enjoying themselves. I have a feeling that we can approach the resolution of social issues in the true sense of the phrase.\n\nTanaka: As part of our preparations in this business partnership, Dai-ichi Life Group formed multiple teams whose members conducted a series of weekly remote meetings with members from DeNA to carry out the project. Along the way, we were able to experience DeNA's free and open corporate culture, with our young employees in particular being considerably stimulated by the experience.\n\nSegawa: We are also learning many things from Dai-ichi Life, such as systematic information-sharing and organized methods of implementing duties by involving departments likely to be connected to those duties in the future at an early stage. Tanaka: Hopefully, this business partnership opportunity will lead to work style reforms and human capital development on both sides in addition to a synergy from a business aspect.",

Additionally, our social environment is also shifting considerably due to a rapid increase in non-face-to-face interaction and digitalization amid the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn this environment, it is envisioned that values and lifestyles will further diversify, and customer needs will become increasingly personalized as well.\n\nAt the same time, it has been pointed out that the insurance coverage rate among the young generation in Japan is declining, revealing a tendency of turning away from insurance. We live in uncertain times, and it precisely for that reason that we recognize our social role as a life insurance company to raise awareness of the various risks in life and eliminate the protection gap (the shortage in insurance coverage amounts relative to necessary coverage amounts).\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to enhance products and services that accommodate diverse customer needs, unite across Dai-ichi Life Group to provide security in the form of 'protection' and, in doing so, co-create the life plan design of each customer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Projection of Productive Age Population in Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives of Dai-ichi Life\n\nThrough life plan design with a grasp of future social shifts and the diversification of lifestyles along with the provision of a full lineup of products, Dai-ichi Life assists each customer with improving their quality of life. To give some specific examples, we use a life plan simulation that takes social security into consideration to visualize possibility of longevity risk related to future income and expenses, provide coverage to prepare against risk in life through consultations with our Total Life Plan Designers and, in doing so, become a closer part of the lives of each customer.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to propose experiential values that promote health and provide peace of mind to our customers through enhancing products and services that accommodate those customers' increasingly diversified and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives of Neo First Life\n\nNeo First Life perceives 'Nice to have in life' that customers themselves have yet to pick up on with a view to their ' Wellness ' (physical and mental satisfaction* 1 ) and endeavors to provide new value through new ideas.

To support the well-being of our customers as their 'lifelong partner' amid such an environment, we believe that it necessary to be close to customers from the stage of asset formation to extension of asset life at postretirement and the succession of assets to the next generation to provide solutions that are optimized for each customer.\n\nUp to this point, Dai-ichi Life Group has built up its strengths and expertise in the various business domains related to asset formation/succession, which include individual savings business, group pension business, asset management business, bancassurance business and  mutual fund business sold over bank counters.\n\nTo face social issues and grow closer to our customers' lives, it is necessary to create new values as the entire Group while bringing together strengths and expertise of the Group and complementing them organically. Moreover, rather than promoting fragmented strategies for our products and sales channels, it is vital to expand services with a higher degree of convenience from the customer's perspective based on the unified operation of a value chain that also integrates the asset formation/succession domains.\n\nAfter unified value chain operation, by also speedily reinforcing capabilities that are lacking in the Dai-ichi Life Group such as asset management based on digital platforms that is implemented through cooperation with external parties, we will prepare our infrastructure for creation of new value. In particular, by providing digital asset formation services, which have been lacking in our efforts so far, we have expanded\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asset Formation and Management in an Elderly Society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Source) Summary of 'Asset Building and Management in an Aging Society,' Report of Working Group on Financial Markets, Financial System Council, Financial Services Agency\n\ncontact points with new customers such as the young generation and realized more familiar support for existing customers.\n\nIn addition, by integrating with existing face-to-face channels, we will establish a CX in the asset formation/ succession domains that is unique to Dai-ichi Life Group.\n\nBy aggressively taking on the challenge of such new initiatives, we will accelerate the transformation of Dai-ichi Life Group as we move forward. Moreover, by leveraging the Group's combined strengths, we will considerably enhance both our conventional main focus of 'protection' and our CX from asset formation/succession. In doing so, we will aim to realize the well-being of our customers in their daily lives and aim to resolve social issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Easily Accessible Asset Formation Support on Daily Basis\n\nAs a form of easily accessible asset formation support offered through digital tools, Dai-ichi Life introduced smartphone app 'DC No Sapuri' to customers who have joined defined contribution plans. This app provides education on investing and asset formation support through means such as visualizing annuity assets, illustrating risk based asset allocation with the use of an equipped robot advisor function, and yield estimations required in order to achieve targets. We are also planning to provide an 'Retirement Account Dashboard (Future Planning Dashboard)' application that visualizes income and expenditure in later life, including public and corporate pensions, and will offer further support for customers' asset formation and the extension of those assets' lives.\n\nAdditionally, to enhance connections with customers, we are also looking into expanding new services such as adding\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncustomer account functionality and asset management tools. By utilizing such easily accessible tools along with providing consulting support through our existing face-to-face channels, we will accelerate creation of new experiential values for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* 'DC' stands for 'defined contribution plan.'\n\n## Enhancement of Product Lineup\n\nWe are planning to enhance our product lineup to also include non-insurance domains to accommodate diverse customer needs in the asset formation/succession domains. We are exploring products and services that flexibly accommodate our customers' asset formation/succession needs, including considering the expansion of products that make use of preferential tax systems such as NISA (tax exemption system for small investments) and iDeCo (individual-type defined contribution pension plan) and development of products that offer returns based on actual investment performance and factor in ultra-low interest rate environments. As lifestyles become increasingly diverse, we will offer optimal solutions that suit each customer through reinforcing our products and consulting capabilities. Additionally, in providing experiential value in the asset formation/succession domains to our customers, we believe combining the strengths of Dai-ichi Life Group will also be important. We will leverage the strengths and expertise that the Group has cultivated over time, including the asset management capability of Group company Asset Management\n\nOne and our business partner Janus Henderson, Dai-ichi Frontier Life's expertise in developing foreign currency and variable insurance products and the consulting capability using face-to-face channels of Dai-ichi Life. In doing so, we will unite across the Group to support the well-being of our customers as we move forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ Related Domains (supplementary fields)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Health and Medical Care\n\nTo resolve social issues such as increasing medical costs and the growing gap between life expectancy and healthy lifespan, we will address commercializing illness prevention and undertake initiatives for controlling the worsening of symptoms for each citizen.\n\nMunehiro Uryu Managing Executive Director\n\n'Well-being' is made up of three forms of happiness: physical, spiritual and social. Undoubtedly, it is health that serves as the door leading to well-being, and the overarching premise for making it a reality. In Japan, there is a tendency for people to seek treatment at medical facilities after they have developed symptoms of illness or the risk of those symptoms to worsen has grown. It is largely owing to the National Insurance System and relatively accessible medical resources compared to other countries. Once an illness worsens, medical treatment costs generally grow considerably. Currently, however, the habit of preventing symptoms before they occur or worsen has not sufficiently taken root. Due to developments in medical technology and the nation's aging society, medical costs assumed by government and health insurance associations are increasing year on year. Moreover, life expectancy is getting longer with every passing year, yet healthy lifespan is falling to keep up with that life expectancy growth, resulting in an enlarged gap between the two. We see this as one of the most serious social issues that Japan faces. The benefit of life insurance manifests itself 'when people cease to be healthy,' when they pass away or become sick or injured. Till now, Dai-ichi Life Group has offered protection for times 'when people cease to be healthy' through life insurance products. However, I want us to contribute to the resolution of social issues such as increasing medical costs and the growing gap between life expectancy and healthy lifespan by safeguarding people's health. Going forward, we will explore solutions for early recognition of future health related risks and provide a seamless platform for easy access to the right medical facilities as a preventive measure or treatment. While providing experiential values that help prevent symptoms before they occur and worsen in cooperation with companies in the health and medical care sectors as well\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand modifying people's habits by promoting shifts in their awareness and behavior, we will contribution to the protection of people's health. The adoption of online means of doing things to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed at a rapid pace. We believe that adoption coupled with digitalization will also bring considerable progress in the health and medical care domains going forward. Additionally, with the Japanese government considering to increase the amount of fees for initial medical examinations at large hospitals, local medical clinics and other similar facilities will play an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis and treatment before illness symptoms worsen. While accommodating such rapid changes, Dai-ichi Life Group will collectively contribute to the realization of people's well-being through the creation of value in the health and medical care domains.\n\n## Presence of Risks of Lifestyle-Related Diseases According to Age Group (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAge 20-29 Age 30-39 Age 40-49 Age 50-59 Age 60-69 Age 70 and up *1: Prepared by Dai-ichi Life based on Appendix 49-1 in the '2019 National Health and Nutrition Survey' published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\n\n*2: Cases where at least one item applies to the below criteria have been included in\n\n'Risks of lifestyle-related diseases present'\n\n| Blood lipids                              | Blood pressure                                                                                                    | Blood glucose                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 HDL cholesterol level     under 40mg/dL | \u00b7 Systolic blood pressure level of    130mmHG or greater \u00b7 Diastolic blood pressure level of    85mmHG or greater | \u00b7 Hemoglobin A1c   (NGSP) level of 6.0%    or greater |\n\n## Special Feature:\n\nMedical Cost Control Support Service for Health Insurance Associations\n\n## Start of Service for Health Insurance Associations in April 2021\n\nWhile many health insurance associations (hereinafter 'associations') recognize the challenge posed by increasing medical costs, they are also concerned about the effect of the implemented measures on medical costs control and how they can make their operations more efficient. An additional headwind is the spread of COVID-19, that is accompanied with  new challenges such as restrictions on conventional face-to-face health guidance and the lack of exercise among association members. In such circumstances, to resolve the challenges faced by associations, Dai-ichi Life Group and the Mizuho Group joined forces to offer 'Healstep SM ,' a service that helps associations with the long-term control of medical costs and the efficient and effective operation of their public health business all with a single package, starting in April 2021. 'Healstep SM ' broadly consists of the following four services: (1) visualization of future risks of developing an illness and forecasts of medical costs using AI, (2) formulation of a response policy based on visualized data, (3) assistance with online health guidance and other matters in cooperation with service providers, and (4) facilitation of behavior changes such as lifestyle improvements through a health and\n\nmedical care app for association members.\n\nAt the 'Data Health Prevention Service Trade Fair 2020' sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which was held in December 2020, the health insurance associations, local governments, companies, etc. who visited the event recognized us with an 'Excellence Award' as an exhibitor who has excellent solutions and services, expressing their wish to use our service.\n\nReceiving the DH1 Grand Prize Excellence Award\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting Long-Term and Stable Operation of Health Insurance Associations\n\nWhile 'Healstep SM ' is a long-term effort with health insurance associations to control medical costs, the ultimate goal is when 'each member of health insurance association is healthy and energetic.' We are confident that this business has a high affinity with the life insurance business, which the Group has been involved in as a 'lifelong partner.' To protect the health of association members even in five and 10 years down the road and to contribute to the stable operation of the health insurance association, in addition to responding to current issues, we will continue to evolve in line with the times and meet the expectations of our customers.\n\nNobuhiko Kawai, Line Manager, Corporate Planning Dept., Dai-ichi Life\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Overseas Business Strategy\n\nAs a driver of the sustainable growth of the Group, we contribute to the well-being of our global customers and Group companies as well as fellow employees who are active around the world.\n\nAtsuko Ochiai Executive Officer\n\nSince commencing our business in Vietnam in 2007, we have expanded into eight countries, namely Thailand, India, Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Cambodia and Myanmar. In fiscal 2020, 20% of our Group adjusted profit was contributed by our overseas insurance business. Through expansion of our business to developed and emerging Asian countries, while benefitting from stable contributions to our profits and medium- to long-term growth, we have engaged in the resolution of social issues faced by each country and the provision of peace of mind to their people through our business. Going forward, in order for our overseas insurance business to continue to be by the side of customers for life and drive forward the further growth of the Group, I believe that the following four challenges must be addressed.\n\nFirst, we must further pursue our CX and improve productivity by actualizing our DX to flexibly accommodate shifts in our society and environment amid the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale. Currently, we are sharing knowhow on DX at overseas Group companies on a Group-wide level, and are pushing forward with collaboration initiatives across the Group. By realizing Group-wide synergy, we will provide better services with greater speed and efficiency.\n\nSecond, we have to incorporate new business models that lead to the sustainable growth of the Group and the realization of our customers' well-being. For example, insurance companies with strong digital capabilities may possess wide-ranging expertise, such as in marketing based on social media and other data and insurance underwriting methods. As a driver of the transformation of Dai-ichi Life Group, our overseas insurance business will take on the challenge of creating new values that would have ripple effects within the Group in addition to traditional insurance business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThird, we require initiatives geared towards sustainability. Given the broadness of sustainability as a concept, the difference in the level of recognition of regional and social challenges across countries must be acknowledged when discussing the resolution of such challenges. As such, aligning the pace among our Group companies in that regard is no easy feat. An example is the reduction of greenhouse gases, which is considered a challenge shared by all nations. However, the positioning of each country and Group company differs with respect to that reduction. Amid such circumstances, having elicited agreement with our initiatives from overseas Group companies, we have commenced to cooperate for setting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.\n\nFourth and last, we need to globalize our organization and human capital. To resolve these challenges, reinforcing our global human capital is of the essence. To achieve that, normally, we would share our strategy and policy with the CEO of each overseas Group company and arrange discussion sessions. However, in the future, we will complement that with the preparation of a framework that enables our fellow employees at each overseas and Group company who possess diverse perspective and specialized knowledge to have independent and active involvement in Group management challenges. Our company's Group vision of 'Protect and improve the well-being of all' was something that was discussed and developed together with our overseas Group companies as well.\n\nWhile tackling the above four challenges will not be easy, we will keep on taking on the challenge of transformation to contribute to the realization of the well-being of our global customers and Group companies as well as our fellow employees who are active around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contributing to the Sustainable Growth of the Group\n\nWe are building a balanced business portfolio in regions with different market stages, such as markets in developed countries that can be counted on for early and steady profit contribution and markets in developing countries that exhibit high growth as well as emerging countries that are in their early phase and are anticipated to expand growth over the long-term.\n\nIn the US and Australian markets, we have realized sustainable growth based on the reinforcement and expansion of sales channels that accommodate changing market environments and through new acquisitions, and we anticipate further contributions to our profit in the future as well.\n\nIn emerging Asian countries, we anticipate high topline growth and profit contributions in the medium- to long-term in line with economic growth and higher insurance penetration rates.

By deploying the expertise and skill that we accumulated through our existing businesses at other regions, we will aim to create Group synergy and explore opportunities for innovation as we move forward.\n\nFor details, see 'Special Feature: Utilization of digital platforms in the Group' on pp. 41-42.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing the Sophistication of Our Global Management Structure\n\nDai-ichi Life Group is working on joint initiatives aimed at the resolution of common challenges in the global group and the sharing of the Group's philosophy and policies for taking advantage of global knowledge and increasing the sophistication of our management. One means through which we are doing so is by establishing the Global Leaders Committee (GLC), comprised of management from overseas Group companies and domestic executive officers mostly from Dai-ichi Life Holdings. As our business portfolio is anticipated to become more diversified in the future, we will be required to formulate and promote more optimal strategies for the Group to adequately accommodate changes in the global environment and manage new businesses appropriately. With our medium-term management plan (MMP), through initiatives such as establishing a new body to discuss our overseas insurance business strategy at our intermediate holdings company, Dai-ichi Life International Holdings, we will aim to realize a management structure that incorporates greater global perspectives while leveraging our human capital at our domestic and overseas Group companies.\n\nScene from a GLC meeting that convened online\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

I believe that it should evolve into an industry that supports the 'well-being' of people, their happiness and reason for living, and offers new experiential values.\n\nIn addition to shifts in industry structure, Dai-ichi Life Group also must adapt to changes in consumers' lives brought about by the diversification and segmentation of lifestyles. In particular, I feel that there are two challenges that we face.\n\nFirst, while we have engaged in trial and error up to this point as well, we must make maximum use of innovation and dramatically transform our CX and EX based on design thinking that places the focus on people. Second, we must spread our wings beyond conventional insurance to provide new value going forward.\n\nI believe that in tackling such challenges, a major mission of the Innovation Team is to fully support intra-Group activities and give Group companies a supportive push forward. One example of that is the development of our 'CX Design System,' a digital transformation (DX) initiative aimed at the creation of new experiential values.\n\nMy view of an ideal future world is one in which insurance products and services could be closer to people through digitalization, AI and other technology. For example, when a cause for insurance claims arises, rather than the traditional approach with the policyholder first contacting the insurance company, it would be ideal for the insurance company to appropriately provide information to the policyholders when they are about to be hospitalized or undergo surgery based on linked data. To accomplish this goal, given the limitations that insurance companies have, a response in the form of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndigitalization of medical care and regional cooperation that involves wider society is needed. As such, I also hope to substantiate this going forward with the involvement of various interested parties.\n\nTo engage individual customers and provide them with experiential values that suits each one of them, we need to have a deep understanding of those individual customers and decipher their latent issues and needs. And for that purpose, we will have to utilize data and create and improve upon services in a manner that only we are capable of.\n\nThese initiatives represent not only a considerable challenge, but also an endless journey of opportunities. Along that journey, the entire Dai-ichi Life Group will collectively continue to pursue creation of innovation to support the wellbeing of people and contribute to the creation of value.\n\nTop:Dai-ichi Life Innovation Lab, Tokyo Bottom:Dai-ichi Life Innovation Lab, Silicon Valley\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Network Aimed at Promotion of Innovation\n\nTo identify global trends in these uncertain times, it is becoming increasingly important to build formidable networks and enhance capabilities for gathering reliable information. To complement our organizational units in Tokyo that are specifically dedicated to innovation, we have established dedicated labs in Silicon Valley and London. Simultaneously, in Asia, we have set up information-gathering sites for generating innovation in Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai as well. We are working towards identifying trends in advanced technologies as well as uncovering and cooperating with startups in a timely manner and on a more global scale that includes the entire European and American regions, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Utilization of AI\n\nDigitalization and the evolution of AI technology have brought changes to the preexisting business structure and operational processes of life insurance companies. It is predicted that a world in which insurance products and services actively approach customers will be realized in the future.\n\nAt Dai-ichi Life, we are closely watching AI technology trends, and are continuously working to discover, verify, and introduce technologies and application examples that can transform existing businesses and lead to new business opportunities.\n\nWe are also deepening our collaboration with the various companies across Dai-ichi Life Group, including those based overseas, and held a three-day virtual workshop bringing together members from Japan, the United States and Australia who pursue innovation and data science. Through such efforts,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Network\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe are accelerating the collaboration of data scientists in the Group by formulating the areas of AI technology utilization and basic principles for AI utilization as a Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of the Innovation Fund\n\nTo improve the customer experience and realize Group synergy, it is necessary to build up innovation capabilities across the Group from a medium- to long-term perspective and explore solutions that can be deployed in multiple regions. To flexibly implement these initiatives that benefit the entire Group, in fiscal 2021, we will establish an Innovation Fund that would help to overcome budgetary and other constraints at each Group company to assist with demonstration experiments and other efforts on a global basis that also involve overseas Group companies. Emphasizing a can-do spirit, we will contribute to the strategic execution of our new medium-term management plan by providing flexible financial support for proposals selected through an objective process that incorporates the opinions of outside experts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to break away from the discounted level of our share price, we strive to improve our capital efficiency that stably exceeds the cost of capital based on a medium- to long-term goal by reducing the cost of capital through risk reduction and improving capital efficiency through the review of our business portfolio based on advanced capital allocation. For the improvement of capital efficiency, we newly introduced adjusted ROE as a valuation indicator to complement ROEV, and implement capital reallocation to higher capital-efficient and growth businesses.\n\nMore specifically, we revised our operation for business assessment based on the cost of capital of 8% across the board for all businesses (while adjusting the differences in domestic and overseas interest rates for overseas businesses) and applied a new cost of capital for each business that takes into consideration individual business risks and market risk premiums in each country for capital allocation and recovery decisions. As for the use of free cash generated through this operation, we will further refine the balance between securing financial soundness, growth investments, and shareholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Main Initiatives for Materialization of Disciplined Capital Management\n\n## Risk Reduction Initiatives\n\nWith regard to risk reductions being implemented with the intention of reducing the cost of capital, our initiatives in fiscal 2020 made significant progress towards our previous target of reducing market-related risk until the end of fiscal 2023, which\n\n## Composition of Market-Related Risk Amounts\n\n## Kept nearly unchanged through risk reductions even as stock market rose considerably\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnd of Mar. 2020\n\nBefore change to ESR standards\n\nEnd of Mar. 2021\n\nBefore change\n\nto standards\n\nEnd of Mar. 2021 After change to standards\n\n*5 Effects of initiatives including effects from the purchase of super-long-term bonds and the rolling of derivatives (approx. \u00a530bn), which were implemented during the fiscal year ended Mar. 2020 as a means of accelerating risk reduction initiatives for the fiscal year ended Mar. 2021, amounted to approx. \u00a5300bn. *6 Including \u00a590bn of effects from a hedging position established with the aim of accelerating risk reduction benefits during the period of this MMP.\n\nwe formulated at the end of fiscal 2019. As a result of reducing market risk by approx. 410 billion yen, Dai-ichi Life kept risk amounts nearly unchanged even as stock market prices rose considerably. Additionally, as a result of reducing interest rate\n\nrisk, our level of sensitivity to domestic interest rates for ESR has steadily declined.\n\nHowever, as of the end of fiscal 2020, among integrated risk amounts held by the Group, market-related risk, mostly consisting of interest rate and equity risks, accounted for 68% and insurance risk under the Group's main business making up 29%. As such, the improvement of our risk profile remains a challenge. In our MMP, while also factoring in our forecast that the lack of transparency and stability in the global financial market and economy will persist going forward, we increased our target amount of market risk reduction until the end of fiscal\n\n2023 and aim to further improve our financial strength.\n\nSpecifically, with regard to interest rate and equity risks, which constitute the majority of our market-related risk, we are aiming to reduce equivalent to approximately 20% (prior to taking financial and changes, etc. into consideration) compared to risk amounts at the end of fiscal 2020 by the end of fiscal 2023. For interest rate risk reductions (approx. 280 billion yen), we promote initiatives through lengthening asset duration and utilizing reinsurance and derivatives.

In addition, we set a medium-term average total payout ratio target of 50% as a rough guide. We will strategically examine and implement flexible additional payouts to shareholders largely through share buyback after taking elements such as ESR and cash flow status, the presence of growth investment opportunities and our company stock price levels into total consideration.\n\nFor payouts to shareholders in fiscal 2020, we distributed cash dividends of 62 yen per share, the same amount as in the previous fiscal year. However, based on the above changes to our shareholder payouts policy, we decided to conduct share buyback in the amount of 200 billion yen, and achieved a significant increase in shareholder returns.\n\nGoing forward, we aim to further improve shareholder returns by putting our business base in Japan and overseas, which we have been expanding and diversifying up until now, onto a growth trajectory, as well as by strengthening the\n\nsustainable growth of Group profit and our ability to generate capital and cash.\n\n## Basic Policy on Shareholder Payouts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *13 Based on our ESR forecast and other factors, we applied a review policy for flexible additional payouts to shareholders based on our new shareholder payout policy.

We will continue initiatives that are truly necessary for a better future.\n\nSeiji Inagaki Representative Director, President\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dai-ichi Life Group's Mission and Approach to Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTsuneta Yano, the founder of Dai-ichi Life, said 'Consider whether people will be pleased with what we do or find it unnecessary. Business that people find useful and convenient is bound to have its value recognized, and people will greatly nurture that business. That is precisely why business is a something that we do for the sake of people.' Having inherited that DNA from Mr.Yano, the Group has grown along with the development of Japan by delivering peace of mind that complies with the needs of people in the prevailing era and pursuing the resolution of social issues throughout its history of over a century.\n\nThe Group will mark its 120th anniversary in 2022. As we head into the future, we will continue contributing to the wellbeing of all people delivering peace of mind across generations and fulfilling and healthy lives. It reflects the basic concept of life insurance business as being 'mutual help' that we aim to realize through harmony with all of our stakeholders. Moreover, we would like to contribute to the well-being of all through a framework of mutual aid not being limited by conventional life insurance policy holders.\n\nIn addition to economic protection during illness or disability, the life insurance business serves as a bridge connecting current and future generations by accepting policyholders' insurance premiums and passing those assets to\n\nsurviving family, children and grandchildren. In other words, being in close to customers and the community over the longterm as their partner for life through life insurance to realize the well-being of future generations could also be called our mission.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the sustainability of society itself is being questioned amid the increase of natural disasters due to global warming and the spreading of COVID-19. Building an easy-to-live society where people can reside with peace of mind rather than leaving aside the issue of global warming or a world where hunger is prevalent to future generations is a critical issue. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that the realization of the well-being of all, including the future generations, is only possible in a sustainable society. We will therefore position the realization of sustainability as the overarching foundation of our business operations, and also tackle serious social issues to ensure the sustainability of communities addressing not only climate change but also respecting the human rights and diversity of all people at an even greater level.\n\nAs a 'lifelong partner,' based on our mission of connecting current and future generations, we will contribute to the realization of a sustainable and resilient society through insurance products and services as an insurer and managing policyholders' assets as an institutional investor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Corporate Conduct Principles for Sustainability\n\nIn April 2011, the Group established the 'Dai-ichi's Social Responsibility Charter,' or DSR charter, to serve as its corporate conduct principles for continuing to meet the expectations of its customers, the community and all of its other\n\nstakeholders.

By recognizing securing social sustainability as the foundation of our business operations, we will proactively address resolution of material issues* 1 related to social sustainability than ever before. In particular, addressing climate change is a material issue recognized globally. With a view to secure sustainability of global environment that is the foundation of people's lifestyles as both an insurance provider and an institutional investor, the Group has adopted goals for realizing carbon neutrality, and will reinforce its initiatives for addressing climate change through its business.\n\nAs part of these initiatives, we are focusing on the proactive disclosure of information based on the TCFD Recommendations* 2 on this page and in our sustainability\n\nreports. In particular, regarding the effects of climate change on the life insurance business (See 'Topics' on p. 56), while there is currently still not an established theory on the subject from a global perspective, we are conducting our own research. While this research has just been initiated, through dialogue with various companies in the industry and government and academic institutions as well as with our investors, it produced the disclosure of analytical processes and analysis results aiming at advancing initiatives and information disclosure.\n\nTo realize the new vision of the Group* 3 , as both insurance provider and institutional investor we will demonstrate leadership in promoting initiatives (including information disclosures) that could serve as a model for others as well. In doing so, we will continue contributing to realization of a carbonfree society leading to a sustainable society.\n\n- *1 Please see 'Material Issues of the Dai-ichi Life Group' on p. 23 for information on those issues.\n- *2 Statement of Agreement with intent of said recommendations on Sep. 2018, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n- *3 The Group's new vision is 'Protect and improve the well-being of all.'

At the same time, we promote the Board-led development of business plans related to climate change to form our stance for integrating climate-related risks into our management.\n\nThe Group is implementing risk management that takes appropriate measures at an early stage by specifying foreseeable risks with the potential to significantly impact its business as 'material risks' and formulating business plans that take these risks into account.* 5 The Risk Management Unit identifies Group material risks based on the results of material risks identification at group companies and taking into consideration the degree of impact and the likelihood of occurrence. The Paris Agreement of 2016 has raised awareness of addressing environmental issues as a challenge that should be tackled by international community. The Group\n\nalso recognizes addressing climate change as a material management risk that could considerably impact customers lives and health, corporate activities, social sustainability, etc. From fiscal 2019 we defined risk related to climate change as a 'material risk,' and have been reinforcing risk management. More specifically, in the course of Group ERM Committee meetings chaired by the officer in charge of risk management, we discuss methods of assessing and dealing with physical and transition risks and, if necessary, report them to the Executive Management Board and to the Board of Directors as well.\n\nFurthermore, to reinforcing our Group governance, we established a 'Group Sustainability Committee' chaired by the president in April 2021, and will establish policies and strategies related to sustainability such as responding to climate change, monitor the implementation status of initiatives, and take other actions going forward. In addition, we have set climate change-related items as one of the KPIs related to executive compensation of Dai-ichi Life, a core subsidiary of the Group.\n\n## Governance/Risk Management System Relating to Climate Change Response (As of April 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *4  In fiscal 2020, climate-related topics were reported to the Board of Directors a total of three times.

Specific Initiatives and Targets\n\nAs an operating company and institutional investor, in March 2021, the Group set medium- to long-term targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions. With further accelerating various\n\ninitiatives and contributing to earlier realization of decarbonized society, we will enhance the resilience of our life insurance and investment management businesses as we move forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## <Initiatives and Targets as an Operating Company>\n\nOriginally, for our CO2 emission reduction targets, we had applied Scope 1* 8 and Scope 2* 8 . Then, we raised targets to conform with targets stated in the Paris Agreement (which calls for limiting the rise in average global temperature to under 1.5 compared to the time before the Industrial Revolution). In addition, for promoting initiatives which would unify all employees unify, Dai-ichi Life set CO2 emission reductions\n\nunder Scope 3* 8 subject to 'items that should be emphasized from the perspective of behavioral change of employees and businesses.'\n\nFor actual CO2 emission data up to fiscal 2020, please see the Dai-ichi Life website (Sustainability Data).\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/sustainability/library/data.html\n\n- *8  Scope 1: Direct emissions from Company. Scope 2: Indirect emissions accompanying use of electric power, etc. supplied from other company.

While research on the impact global warming is conducted in various sectors, where the payment of insurance claims and benefits is concerned, changes in human health and natural disasters may have direct effects. According to a report (Assessment Report on Effects of Climate Change)* 10 by the Ministry of Environment of Japan, an increase in heatstroke during the summer season, an increase in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases associated with production of photochemical oxidants, ozone and other pollutants. Moreover, report informs about the spread of infectious diseases due to the expanded habitat of mosquitos and mites and the intrusion of non-native species, an increase in heatstroke, infections and mental illness among disaster victims due to the prolonged living as refugees. As for natural disasters, the more frequently occurring  flooding, inundation and landslide disasters may also have impact.\n\nIn recent years, documents concerning these effects have been published by a large number of research institutions, making them a growing subject of attention. In addition to investigating and analyzing such research results, the Group is promoting comprehensive grasp of risks and quantifying their effects after factoring in the attributes of the insurance products that it underwrites.\n\nFor initiatives for fiscal 2020, as a joint endeavor with Mizuho-DL Financial Technology, we analyzed the relationship\n\nbetween global warming and the payment of death insurance claims by Dai-ichi Life. In an analysis where focus was placed on the increase in health hazards caused by global warming during the summer season, using actual death insurance claim payments for the last several years, we inferred a relationship between peak temperatures across Japan and mortality. The results of this analysis showed that if we applied a RCP8.5 scenario* 10 , relative to past results (for fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2019), the increase in mortality rate would be estimated at approx. 0.4% in the 2050s and approx. 1.0% in the 2090s. When these estimates are applied to actual death insurance claim payments by Dai-ichi Life in fiscal 2020 (approx. 400 billion yen), they amount to an increase of approx. 1.5 billion yen at a rate of 0.4% and an increase of approx. 4.0 billion yen at a rate of 1.0%. The analysis and quantification of the effects of climate change on the life insurance business are recognized as being researched and analyzed by various companies through a process of trial and error, with no standard methods being established internationally at this time. The effects analysis recently performed by the Group is limited to a statistical analysis of the correlation between peak temperatures and death based on past results data at Dai-ichi Life using various researches as a reference.* 11 We believe there are many challenges, such as investigations of the occurrence of various diseases, approaches from a medical viewpoint and impact investigations at our various overseas companies, and we will continue  understanding risks across the entire Group as we move forward.\n\n## Assessment Report on Effects of Climate Change (Summary) (Ministry of Environment, Dec 2020)* 12\n\n<!-- image -->",

One of those investees is Unifa, a venture company that works towards reducing the burden related to childcare and improving the quality of childcare with the use of the latest technology in the form of IoT* 2 and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unifa Founder and CEO Yasuyuki Toki and Board Director and CFO Naoto Hoshi sat down with Yosuke Kawanishi of The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., Ltd.'s Alternative Investment Department to have a roundtable on the meaning and future prospects for ESG investment, among other themes.\n\n- *1  Investment method consisting of making investment judgments with the intention of simultaneously acquiring investment earnings and creating a social impact such as a shift in society's social structure. *2 Abbreviation for 'Internet of Things.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in Unifa based on its balance between earnings potential and sociality\n\nKawanishi: The Life insurance business has the role of 'bridging generations' by accepting insurance premiums from policy holders and passing them to their children through insurance benefits. In that sense, children who belong to the next generation are our largest stakeholders. Realizing a society where children can have fulfilling lives and solving social issues indicated by SDGs is very important. While Dai-ichi Life Group has been selecting material issues that it should tackle based on that idea, we feel a strong affinity between our initiatives and the aims of Unifa, namely 'the creation of environments at childcare facilities that are easy to work in' and 'the improvement of the quality of childcare.'\n\nToki: I first met Mr. Kawanishi about two years ago. At that time,\n\nI had a strong desire to contribute to the resolution of social issues as an entrepreneur, and was also aware that a similar large wave was approaching the investor side as well. I remember quite well my novel feeling of surprise at realizing that if I could inspire shareholders with the same ambitions to join us, all parties, shareholders, management, employees and customers included, could unify for tackling the challenge that social issues bring.\n\nHoshi: My prior job was at a foreign-owned securities company. Since I had roughly 12 years of experience in the market, I had a sense of the global trends surrounding ESG investment from five to six years back. I had just been blessed with a child myself, and wanted to do something that would positively serve my child's future. It was at that time that I met Mr. Toki, and ended up joining Unifa with a strong conviction in its social awareness and future potential. I felt that welcoming\n\nshareholders with an ESG viewpoint would prove to be considerably advantageous to us as well. Dai-ichi Life has been focusing on this field since the beginning of ESG investment. We believe that if we could inspire such a leader in the field to invest in our organization, we could get both public and market recognition of Unifa.\n\nKawanishi: I am extremely grateful to hear that. I should say, however, that in making an investment, the first thing we do is evaluate that investment from a financial investment standpoint. In that aspect as well, I recall having the strong impression that the business of Unifa was very elaborately build-up. While firmly building up its earnings stream through offering to watch over infants at childcare facilities during their naptime and various ICT (information and communications technology) services such as digital contact ledgers and childcare facility attendance management, Unifa sought to gain upside through a service that enable parents and guardians to make online purchases of photos and videos of children in childcare facilities. I am sure that Unifa continues to grow. Additionally, the company's agency strategy involving cooperation with childcare trading companies proved to be successful, giving it the attractive potential to establish dominant position in the childcare domain. Another aspect of Unifa that we highly valued next to its solid business was the social aspect of its business. It can be difficult to strike a balance between the earnings potential of a business and its social aspect in certain fields. In the case of Unifa, however, we believed that in addition to financial returns, we could count on the company to have a sizeable social impact. That optimal balance was the deciding factor in our investment. Toki: Thank you. To be frank, upon receiving an investment from Dai-ichi Life, not only did we feel relieved at having a stable shareholder from a long-term perspective, but also examined the aspect of a business synergy between our companies. Dai-ichi Life pursues the promotion of high valueadded with the use of digital technology in its insurance business. Moreover, as an institutional investor as well, the company carefully establishes a dialogue with its investee companies and extends its reach to even the deeper areas of those companies. Furthermore, Dai-ichi Life is also capable of engaging in deep discussion from an ESG perspective. That sense of overall balance, I feel, makes Dai-ichi Life an incomparable shareholder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A partner that watches over its investee and accompanies them from a long-term perspective\n\nKawanishi: I am sure that assessing social impact in ESG investment proves to be difficult in certain areas. Not all elements can be measured in quantitative terms. At the same time, if those areas are not properly assessed, there will be no governance to speak of. To be frank, we regularly continue to look for better investment methods.\n\nHoshi: Our final goal is to realize our purpose of 'making families happy.' An example of one of the things we will do to reach that goal is improve the working environment of childcare workers and decrease their turnover rate, which is a mediumterm goal. At the same time, while rarely discussed, there are various reasons for those workers to leave their jobs, and their working environment is not necessarily the sole problem. As such, even if we hypothetically set a target figure for the turnover rate, there would be difficulties in determining any direct relationship that turnover would have with the introduction of our services. Dai-ichi Life has an understanding of that reality while also having a very good understanding of the importance of climbing ladder one step at a time. Venture companies as a general rule are short on all management resources, be that people, money, or time. Within that situation, we feel that Dai-ichi Life is accompanying us from a long-term point of view. Kawanishi: I'm very glad that you feel that way. The liabilityside duration at a life insurance company is long, approaching as long as 19 years in our company's case. That is why we are able to invest with a long-term perspective. In that sense as well, we find our ESG investments to have a high degree of\n\n## Unifa: Using Digital Technology to Make Families Happier\n\nSince being founded in 2013, Unifa has espoused 'bringing forth new social infrastructure in the world that makes families happy' as its purpose, and has expanded its childcare support services that make use of IoT and AI across Japan. The company assists with the creation of environments that mitigate the burden of childcare-related tasks as well as increase the time that childcare workers have involvement with their children and help improve the quality of childcare.\n\nUnifa currently promotes its 'Smart Childcare Center.' Its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nleading services include 'Lookmee \u00ae Smart Baby Monitor' for keeping an eye on infants when they nap and 'Lookmee \u00ae Photo' that allows photos and videos of children to be purchased online. As of June 2021, the cumulative number of childcare facilities across Japan that introduced 'Lookmee \u00ae '-series services exceeded 11,000.",

Toki: Like Mr. Hoshi said, it will take a long time for us to reach the final goal. Right now, it is hard to claim that either the issue with waitlisted children or the issue with the shortage of childcare workers has been resolved yet. I roughly estimate that it will take at least 10 years to achieve the goals promoted with SDGs, including those that involve the health, welfare and education of children and gender-blindness. I believe that we have taken on the challenge of changing Japan's social framework. As the founder of Unifa, I am most grateful that a shareholder with a high aspiration such as Dai-ichi Life will be accompanying us as we carry out this long social transformation.\n\nHoshi: Being able to benefit from support over the long-term is also important from the financial aspect. We are always considering going public as an option to take with respect to our growth strategy and financial strategy. However, Dai-ichi Life will support us not from just a short-term perspective until we go public, but from a long-term one that would include the time after we go public. I believe that perspective perfectly matches our growth strategy. In June 2021 when we sought additional financing, Dai-ichi Life made an additional investment in us again.\n\nKawanishi: In having a long-term business relationship, mutual understanding will be important. By being an observer at Unifa's\n\nBoard of Directors' meetings and maintaining contact with the company over phone and email, I believe that we are successfully communicating with a high degree of transparency. Actually, when spread of COVID-19 began, Unifa became unable to conduct face-to-face sales, which had been its main touch point. We therefore had concerns that the company would encounter harsh business conditions. However, Unifa cultivated new touch points with childcare facilities by using crowdfunding to hand out masks at those facilities free of charge, and enhanced bonds of trust with anxious parents and guardians by holding online seminars. In those ways, the company demonstrated its startup-like flexibility and mobility and maintained its growth. Simultaneously, Unifa carefully explained the status of its response to us, investors in the company, as well. Largely because of that, we were able to keep an eye on the situation while feeling completely at ease.\n\nHoshi: I see investors as being members of a single team that ride the same boat, that boat being Unifa. Therefore, I hope that we will also disclose things that don't proceed as expected or are negative in nature, and engage in constructive discussion moving forward. The good thing about being a private company is that the issuers can choose the shareholders. Dai-ichi Life empathized with our purpose and understood the various difficulties faced by a venture company based on addressing social issues, which makes it possible to engage in repeated constructive discussion from a medium- to long-term perspective and proceed together hand in hand. That is the kind of shareholder that Unifa now has on its team, and that is why we report information that is not positive as well.\n\n## Changing society means changing the flow of money\n\nKawanishi: We see Unifa as being poised to launch a fullfledged platform service that integrates its preexisting services from this summer on. I look forward to the company leading the pack by becoming synonymous with a DX for childcare among all people who are connected with childcare facilities, including childcare workers, parents and guardians, as well as eventually\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExtension charges can also be calculated with a breeze\n\nThe 'Lookmee \u00ae ' series is an integrated ICT service for childcare facilities that makes use of the latest technology, including AI and IoT. Unifa is also expanding and promoting 'Smart Childcare Center,' a series of next-generation childcare facilities that mitigate the burden of clerical work and other tasks on the frontlines of childcare to give childcare workers some extra time and mental rest and also realize children's rich development and the happiness of families.\n\nOver the medium to long term, while utilizing data accumulated on the development and growth of children since birth, we will be examining initiatives such as the provision of educational materials tailored to the developmental stage and interests of each child.\n\ncompany is also focusing on developing an environment that our employees find easy to work in at an early stage. Hoshi: I believe that private venture companies that develop their governance frameworks on the same level as a listed company and willingly take action in that regard will help raise the level of venture companies as a whole. Additionally, my feeling is that in Japan, there has yet to be a fixed image of a successful example of ESG investment in a venture company based on the resolution of social issues. If we can succeed beyond a certain level as a venture company that has established a balance between economic potential and social aspect, I think that we will set an easy-to-understand example of a different entrepreneurial model, and the next generation of social entrepreneurs will increase rapidly. In that sense, I want to make sure Unifa succeeds as a company for the sake of establishing a next-generation ecosystem as well. Toki: With our services having been introduced in over 11,000 facilities across Japan, as we proceed to develop a platform for our services on a full scale, we will likely need to cooperate and otherwise deal with members of other industry categories and, depending on the circumstances, local governments. Our forthcoming challenge, therefore, will be to establish a sales and marketing structure with a greater degree of formability than before and develop a 'strong platform' in the true sense of the word. Moreover, in the future, I am eager for us to expand our business overseas. To give an example, in Southeast Asia, women are increasingly entering the workforce, causing the number of childcare facilities to grow dramatically. In addition to already conducting experiments at childcare facilities in Singapore, we already regularly receive inquiries and other contact from the region. We hope to join forces with Dai-ichi Life, who made an additional capital investment in Unifa, as well as with our other shareholders and stakeholders in order to build a new ecosystem and place ourselves on a more solid growth trajectory.\n\nKawanishi: We have great expectations for the ecosystem that you are aiming to realize. Moreover, we believe that there is significant potential for you to grow overseas as well as in Japan. ESG investment is continuing to gain speed. As the ESG strategy of various companies becomes increasingly refined, I believe that we at Dai-ichi Life must also rise to the occasion to become a 'chosen investor.' Thank you.\n\nbecoming a company that is capable of providing solutions that positively serve the frontlines of childcare, including households. Toki: We will start by using the DX of the childcare industry to visualize the interest and developmental state of each individual child to make the frontlines of childcare more personalized. By establishing an environment that enables childcare workers to do their jobs while leveraging their expertise, we expect that both job satisfaction and value-added will go up. Additionally, the visualization of children's state will also lead to a change in how money is spent, as childrearing families will discover what kind of baby food suits their children and what kind of educational toys are the right ones. We want to create a system where part of that money can be given back to the childcare frontlines. I see our resolution to social issues eventually taking the form of 'changing the flow of money.' Changing that into shareholder value and corporate value is what management's job is all about. While a process of trial and error will continue for the time being, we hope to think about the question of how we will convey the value of our business to capital markets and how we will elicit recognition and understanding of that value along with Dai-ichi Life, and proceed to set a pioneering practice. Hoshi: I feel that a perspective of tailor-made to the developmental state and interests of each individual child is an important element of their sound growth. Yet, that perspective seems to be missing in children's infancy. If an environment containing such a perspective can be realized with the use of our tools, it will play a huge role in the growth of children. What's more, I imagine that parents and guardians will want to leave their children in the care of a facility with that environment in place. Childcare facilities will also likely be able to offer better childcare. Both sides will experience mutual improvement, and society, I believe, will head in a more positive direction as a result. It would make me glad if we arrived at such a destination in the future.\n\n## Aiming to create a new ecosystem\n\nKawanishi: To make further dramatic leaps as we move forward, Unifa is also proactively addressing the reinforcement of its governance and promotion of diversity and inclusion. This June, Unifa made the transition to a company with an audit and supervisory committee. Simultaneously, it announced the inauguration of a female outside director.

And it is our 70,000 group employees that drive the realization of that aim. For us to be closer to our customers and provide them the very best products and services and contribute to communities to realize sustainable society, we require a workplace environment in which group employees find satisfaction in their work and able to do their jobs with high energy and motivation. We believe that leveraging diversity and realizing employees' fullest potential will lead to our sustainable growth. Based on such a viewpoint, the Group focuses on the promotion of diversity and inclusion in its initiatives. Under the top management leadership, we promote the achievements of the women who make up a majority of our employees, and have brought our ratio of female employees in managerial positions* 3 to 27.5% through efforts such as establishing an appropriate work environment, enhancing offered systems, and providing leadership development training programs to our female employees. On the other hand, the ratio of women in position of a department or section head at our organization is only about 10%. We aim to bring this percentage up to 30% by April 2024, and will promote realization of diversity among the decision-makers at our company with greater speed through implementing succession planning under which women would account for 30% of the candidates listed up by our executive officers for the department in charge. As we will make diversity our strength going forward, we are pursuing initiatives such as expanding the work domain of employees with disabilities predominantly at our special subsidiary Dai-ichi Life Challenged and proactively hiring experienced talent to diversify our homogeneous workforce. At present, approx. 30%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the people whom we hire are mid-career hires. We will continue going beyond narrowly defined gender-based diversity and aggressively promote diversity that include hiring nonJapanese individuals and midcareer hires to core positions. Amid COVID-19 pandemic we have put the health of our employees, their family members and our customers first, and have established new work styles that take advantage of telecommuting. We will continue implementing new work styles that are not bound by time or place, and will enhance connections with customers and fellow employees within an environment that is conducive to communication and collaboration 'anytime, anywhere, and with anyone.' Simultaneously, we will aim to improve employee engagement through further enhancing productivity and enhancing work life balance. Going forward, we will continue contributing to the well-being of our customers and society with diversity and inclusion as the driving force of our sustainable growth.\n\n*3  As of April 1, 2021.

These initiatives include the application of telecommuting and the flextime system.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we enhanced our systems through introduction of 'Quality of Life Improvement Leave,' a system which allows employees to take time off for a broad range of purposes such as volunteer work, infertility treatment and selfdevelopment, and 'hourly-based holidays,' where employees can take flexible hourly-based holidays.\n\nPromotion of Diverse Work Styles\n\n## Flexible Choice in Time and Location Fosters Greater Innovation\n\n'Dai-ichi Life Innovation Lab' members who lead innovation in the Group, pursue flexible work styles to promote collaborations with start-up enterprises and other entities inside and outside Japan.\n\n## Location\n\nAs the use of Teams and other Web meeting tools is promoted across the entire department, we can work from multiple locations, including home and co-working space in addition to office space. Generally, members individually choose the location where their productivity and motivation are enhanced.\n\nAt proof of concept (PoC), which substantiates new ideas in a short time frame, members may bring together involved parties at a co-working space to engage in discussion as they gather around a whiteboard. Conversely, they may wrap-up things without meeting in person. Based on the particularities of the matter at hand and their own situation, members select the optimal place to generate ideas and implement projects.\n\n## Work-Life Management\n\nWe also promote work-life balance so that our employees can approach their work with energy. For example, we offer seminars regarding health issues particular to women, and support their career with childcare/nursing care. We also encourage fathers to take part in childcare by providing educational materials on taking childcare leave and supporting tools for managers to promote the participation of our male employees in childcare. Through company-wide encouragement, the rate of childcare leave taken by our male employees in fiscal 2020 was 91.3%, an 11.5% increase over the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Time\n\nIn creating innovation, the input of new information and networking are essential. That is why we proactively take part in seminars and pitch events, including those held overseas where there is a time difference.

The time that directly followed the birth of my child happened to fall upon a peak busy period at work, forcing me to leave unfamiliar tasks of childcare completely to my wife in addition to household duties. Therefore, I consulted with my superior about taking childcare leave upon a break in my workload. Because the duration of that leave would be long, I wrapped up any duties that I could on my own, and handed over any other duties to my colleagues. I am grateful to my superior and my colleagues for their support, without which I would not have been able to take childcare leave. After talking things over with my wife, we decided to leave cooking with my wife and split other household chores and childcare duties equally. Over my four\n\nmonths of childcare leave, I am confident that I became able to perform the full range of childcare duties, from bathing and clothing to putting my child to bed. I was able to get a real sense of just how challenging a childcare is and share that with my wife. Not only that, but I was also able to see my child growing right by my side, a wonderful experience that I\n\nwould not trade for anything. Plus, I had enough time to think about my family and myself, broadening my horizons.\n\nHideki Okada Line Manager Human Resources Dept.\n\nThe Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The essence of CG is a\n\nmechanism for transparent, fair, prompt and resolute decision-making based on the stakeholder model.\n\nFirst of all, with regard to transparency and fairness, it is unfortunate that incidents of fraudulent mishandling of cash by employees occurred at Dai-ichi Life. The Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and other outside directors have been committed to clarifying the facts, analyzing the true cause of these incidents, and clarifying responsibility, with the help of third parties. In response, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexecutives are now working diligently to formulate and thoroughly implement countermeasures, identify similar cases, and prevent recurrence over the medium- to longterm, including reforming the corporate culture, in a transparent manner.\n\nNext, I believe that there is still some way to go in terms of speed and decisiveness. It is true that the new medium-term management plan has been evaluated by investors and shareholders as clearly showing the management's intentions. However there are expectations for us to implement and realize the plan quickly and decisively.\n\nThe life insurance business is a long-term business. Even if a company makes an omission, it does not mean\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat business performance will deteriorate drastically. For this reason, to put it harshly, it is an industry that is prone to so-called 'boiled frogs.'\n\nTo prevent this from happening and to fulfill our responsibility to our stakeholders, I would like to ask the executives to exercise self-discipline and to work tirelessly for transformation. We, the outside directors, have a responsibility to support them in this process. For this reason, I believe that continuous evolution is necessary for CG as well.\n\nAt the same time, outside directors also need to continuously refine themselves. During the previous fiscal year, the outside directors alone held 17 meetings and had two study sessions with investors and analysts. On top of",

Although the Company underwent a transformation from an insurance company to a holding company in 2016, I think that in some respects we have continued with our previous approach to governance. Over the past few years, the outside directors have had numerous discussions about the direction of CG as a holding company, and we have also been in discussions with the executives.\n\nIn the management of the Board of Directors, the chairman of the board was changed from the chairman and representative director to the chairman and director, to clarify the roles of supervision and execution. In addition, being a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, we have strengthened the Nominations Advisory Committee and the Remuneration Advisory Committee by allowing outside directors who do not belong to the respective committees to participate as observers, to enhance the effectiveness of the committees by incorporating more diverse opinions. However, it is necessary to go back to the basics of the holding company's roles and continue to work on the evolution of group governance.\n\nSato\n\nI think that the previous fiscal year was a landmark\n\nyear in the history of the Dai-ichi Life Group. We, the outside directors, have been exchanging opinions and engaging in discussions with the executives with a great deal of awareness. The starting point for this was the fact that we found the opinions of shareholders that resonated with us. Therefore, we held a study session for outside directors only and discussed with the executives, which led to the formulation of the current medium-term management plan.\n\nI am proud to say that we, outside directors, did our best, and I think we were also able to do this because the executives took our opinions seriously. After all, no matter what the outside directors say, if the executives do not listen, there will be no real discussions. In this way, I believe that the relationship between outside directors and executives has entered a different stage.\n\nHowever, we should not be contented, because we are also institutional investor, and we need to set an example. In the current fiscal year, I hope to further discuss the future vision of the Group not only with the outside directors but also with the executives.\n\nMasuda I also feel that the past year has been a period of the greatest progress in strengthening governance.\n\nFirst of all, compared to the past, there have been more opportunities for internal and external directors to exchange opinions, and we have been able to communicate with many people, including President Inagaki. I believe that CG evolves through the accumulation of such opportunities, and I hope to be able to talk with many more people in the future.\n\nIn addition, since the previous fiscal year, there have been several incidents of fraud discovered at Dai-ichi Life, and I think this was one of the reasons why governance has been strengthened significantly. Although it can be very difficult to reform the corporate culture for a company with a long tradition, we need to strengthen and reform our governance with a greater sense of speed in light of the changing business environment.\n\nFor example, the proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive released by the European Commission in April will require companies to guarantee non-financial information such as climate-related risks from 2023. Although the directive only applies to listed companies in the EU, it will eventually be required of Japanese companies as well, so we need to collect and analyze the latest information and consider how to respond to it. As an outside director, I think it is necessary for us to stay informed of such major trends of the times and respond to them.\n\nIn addition, as the Board of Directors of a holding company, we need to discuss management control and resource allocation for the entire Group, which has a global business presence, from the perspective of increasing\n\ncorporate value. When doing so, it is important to always be aware of stakeholders such as employees, business partners, and contractors, not to mention shareholders, and I think the challenge is to be able to disclose and explain our actions to society with sufficient care.\n\nInoue Last fiscal year was the year to formulate the new medium-term management plan, so it was a very important year to discuss the medium- to long-term management direction. Being aware of this point, the outside directors have been exchanging opinions about what issues should be discussed since the end of the year before last.\n\nIn March of last year, the outside directors informed the president of our recognition of the two main issues: future management strategy issues and governance issues. There are four points as management strategy issues: changing our risk-taking policy and securing resources for business investment, reforming our domestic business, future growth strategies including global business, and renewing our corporate culture and behavioral patterns. The following six points were raised as governance issues: strengthening the leadership of the president as the top executive officer, improving the effectiveness of governance by the Board of Directors, whether the president of the holding company should serve concurrently as president of Dai-ichi Life which is an operating company, simplifying the global business supervision system, whether the C-Suite* system should be introduced, and appointing and selecting next generation leadership.\n\nWe were able to achieve a certain results with regard to our financial strategy in the new medium-term management plan, and we will continue to hold free and vigorous discussions on these issues at meetings of outside directors and between outside directors and the executives in order to achieve steady results this fiscal year. *A top management positions beginning with the letter 'C,' such as CEO and CFO. Olcott I agree that the previous fiscal year was a year of great significance for the Company because we were able to have solid discussions toward the formulation of the medium-term management plan.\n\nIt is said that at Japanese companies, traditionally Board of Directors approves what executives have formulated without much discussion. This is even true when it comes to important matters such as the medium-term management plan. In the case of our Company, I don't think this was the case when we formulated our previous medium-term management plan, but looking back now, I feel that the previous medium-term management plan seems to be an extension of our traditional strategy, and this time we were able to have more in-depth discussions through a more thorough review process.\n\nIn addition, this time we were able to analyze the\n\ncompetitive environment, benchmark not only domestic but also overseas competitors, and thoroughly discuss the cost of capital and capital allocation, which resulted in, for example, the decision to sell shares in Janus Henderson and a large-scale share buyback.\n\nThrough this process, I think the way of engagement between outside directors and the executives, especially the president, has changed a lot. Although I have served as an outside director of many companies, I don't think there is any company where the president and outside directors have such a constructive dialogue.\n\nAlthough results have yet to be seen, I hope that we can look back in five years' time and say that the last year was a turning point.\n\nShu The first main point regarding governance is the dialogue with shareholders. I think that the executives actively responded to the shareholders' viewpoints. However, what is particularly commendable is that they did not just respond on the surface, but took it very seriously in terms of what the shareholders' requests were and how the Company should change itself to incorporate them.\n\nThe second point is that we were able to give the impression to shareholders and the market that the current medium-term management plan has taken a step in a direction that is not an extension of the past, and in the process, top management played a significant role and outside directors were able to provide reasonable cooperation. I think it will continue to be an extremely important point in governance for outside directors to contribute to the creation of an environment in which the entire executive team is unified under the leadership of top\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the provision of value to all stakeholders is circulating well, then the corporate value as a going concern should at least\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTheme 2\n\n## Process of Formulating the Medium-Term Management Plan\n\nShingai Let's look back at the process of formulating the medium-term management plan. While I am a believer in the stakeholder model, ever since I became an outside director in 2019, I have believed that being on the same page with shareholders is not sufficient. In particular, the low price-to-book value ratio (PBR) is a major problem. In order to solve this problem, ROE exceeding the cost of capital and future growth scenarios are essential.\n\nWith regard to the former, we had numerous dialogues with the executives, and they started reviewing the cost of capital and recognized a higher cost of capital, and then committed to achieving ROE that exceeds the cost of capital. As the first step of this action, we made it clear that we would aim to improve our risk profile by boldly reducing market risks. By doing so, we wanted to reduce our beta of the CAPM formula and deploy the generated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapital for investment in business growth and shareholder payout policies.\n\nOn the other hand, although the outline of the growth scenario is becoming clearer, we believe that there are still many things to be considered in order to realize it. From this perspective, although the Group has seen the light at the end of the tunnel for the financial turnaround, the realization of the business transformation is still an important issue going forward. In this era of VUCA, I believe that we will be required to constantly think and act while running. Shu At the root of it all, there was a recognition that we needed to make a medium-term management plan that would lead to the creation of solid corporate value, and I think it was appropriate to focus on lowering the cost of capital to achieve this. With regard to the reduction of the cost of capital, there was a lot of discussion about the target and the time frame for risk reduction. Naturally, whether or not to reduce risk is also affected by the market environment, so we will continue to work on this issue with a greater sense of speed than we have discussed so far, while the market environment is favorable.\n\nIn addition, we need to continue to have disciplined discussions on what to do with the generated capital as a result of risk reduction, how to strike a balance between shareholders returns and growth investment, and how to prioritize areas for growth investment.\n\nOlcott The current medium-term management plan focuses on improving the balance sheet, especially reducing marketrelated risks such as eliminating duration mismatches and reducing equity exposure. However, to improve stock price valuation, we must also be aware of the income statement. In particular, because margin pressure is increasing in the mature domestic life insurance market, a challenge for us is to make our management more conscious of our ability to earn profits by exploring new business opportunities and\n\nexceed the value of dissolution. If this is not the case, then it is clear that the company's ability to provide value to customers, employees, and society will be limited in the medium- to long-term. Recognizing that a company's emphasis on social contribution is not an excuse for damage to shareholder value should be the starting point for the governance issues facing Japanese companies today.\n\n## reducing fixed costs.\n\nAlso, we have not been able to fully discuss the organization related matters. In order to realize our vision the medium- to long-term, for example, five years from now, we need to not only set numerical targets, but also determine what kind of organizational development we should pursue.\n\nSato The structure of a stock company is similar to the system in which the electorate elects the members of the Diet, the members elect the prime minister, and the prime minister assembles the Cabinet. Because we are elected and entrusted by our shareholders, I think it is important that we give attention to our shareholders first.\n\nThe medium-term management plan is based on issues we should be aware of when we face all of our stakeholders. In fact, based on the opinions of our shareholders, we have raised issues with our executives regarding the valuation of our stock price including cost of capital and the inadequate level of customer satisfaction.\n\nI believe that the reason for making customer experience as one of the basic strategies in the mediumterm management plan is because the executives felt the necessity to more sincerely contemplate customers.\n\nIn this way, we directors recognize the importance of keeping a close eye on all directions, including shareholders, customers, employees, and the global environment, and listening carefully to the voices of each. After that, we need to exchange opinions with the executives on these various points, and monitor whether the executives are able to fulfill their duties accordingly. Maeda In formulating the medium-term management plan, outside directors and President along with other executive officers have had a series of discussions since June last year, and I believe that the ideas of the outside directors have been incorporated in essential areas.\n\nIn the convocation notice of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it was announced that a total of 13 discussions were held, but I think the quality of discussions worth more attention than the quantity of discussions held. We started discussing financial strategies such as cost of capital and risk reduction plans, which were also raised as issues at the outside directors' meeting, and once we had some sense of financial strategy direction, we moved on to discuss growth strategies, which I think also lead to smooth flow of discussion.\n\nIn addition, during this period, there were fraud incidents that could harm the trust in the entire Group, and the outside directors raised the issue of the need for not only preventive measures but also a fundamental review of the corporate culture to firmly address the problem, and I\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbelieve this view is reflected in the core of the medium-term management plan. In terms of the specific issues, while I think there is still room for improvement in the risk and cost reduction plans for the entire Group, I do think it is important to improve them by following the process, even if it is while running.\n\nMasuda I think the most important role and function of outside directors is to contribute to improving the reputation from the capital market. Although our stock price has risen as a result of various measures, I don't think it is high enough yet.\n\nCorporate valuation is an evaluation of a company's performance and its business plans, including its business and financial strategies. On the other hand, many shareholders believe that stock price is determined by total return, which is the combination of dividends and share buybacks. In any case, even though we have been making reasonable efforts to increase corporate value, I think we are still lacking speed.\n\nIf we take cost reduction as an example, perhaps this is something that we can achieve more quickly. In terms of new business development, probably there is still room for speedy improvements, such as how to organize the sales channels of the three life insurance companies in Japan and how to sort out the issues of product overlap and cannibalization. I am sure we will continue to discuss various issues as we follow up on the progress of the medium-term management plan, and I would like to keep asking the executives to address these points.\n\nInoue The most significant achievement was the financial strategy, where we were able to present an in-depth plan",

Although the finance and accounting of life insurance is unique, I think it was significant that the outside directors, who are well versed in the finance and accounting of the life insurance business, took the lead in the discussions on the formulation of the financial strategy, asked the executives for the necessary data, and after the outside directors as a whole had digested the data, we were able to hold high-quality discussions with the executive team. We were able to do this because the executive team showed us all the weaknesses at the draft stage and engaged in sincere discussions.\n\nThe balance between growth and returns is also a difficult issue. Although our announcement of a share buyback of 200 billion yen, or 10% of our market capitalization of over 2 trillion yen, was well received by the market, it is also important to actively allocate capital to growth and strategic investments to avoid falling into a contractionary equilibrium. In order to do so, we need to present a story of how we can improve the corporate value of the entire Group from a long-term perspective and gain the understanding of the market. I feel that dialogue with the market will become increasingly important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Theme 3: Expectations and Challenges for the Executives in Implementing the Medium-Term Management Plan\n\nShingai In the previous fiscal year, we formulated our medium-term management plan amid the spread of COVID-19, and we recognized that the business environment has accelerated efforts to address social issues, particularly digital transformation (DX), climate change, and environmental issues. This trend will continue to accelerate further.\n\nIn the age of VUCA, a medium-term management plan begins to become outdated just after the moment it is created. For this reason, I believe that we need a process of constantly rolling out what we will do in the future and what we will do in the medium term, always with an eye on the long-term.\n\nThis means (1) creating a concrete vision of the future that we want to achieve, and checking it constantly. Based on the prospective view of the demographic changes that already occurred, we need to review the constantly changing and accelerating megatrends, and constantly check and refine the picture of the future we want to achieve. This also means (2) a dynamic approach to the process of backcasting, recognizing the gap between the current situation and the future, renewing the management issues on a daily basis, and creating strategies to deal with them now.\n\nIn this process of examining and formulating strategies for coping with the current situation, I would like the executives to involve young people with high integrity and ability, who are full of an ownership mindset, and who have the potential to lead the next generations of management. This is because consistent and organizational\n\nwill is necessary for successful transformation.\n\nOn the other hand, while the expansion of overseas business is a major pillar of our growth strategy, our next challenge is the evolution of group governance. From the Company's point of view, I would like to see digital technology used to promote decision-making in overseas businesses and the visualization of management and risk information. From my experience, I can say that it will lead to a greater transfer of authority to individual overseas companies, while strengthening the self-governance of each company. This is because individual companies will try to straighten themselves out when they are being monitored.\n\nLastly, I would like to talk about expectations. In addition to financial literacy, I would like the future executive team to improve their digital literacy. Keeping up to date with the possibilities of individual digital technologies and what they can do at this point in time, and improving their ability to utilize them will be essential in brushing up their picture of the future.\n\nOlcott As I mentioned earlier, we need to think about our future state, and I think we need to be aware of the three 'states' when we discuss them.\n\nThe first is the state of the world. Considering the trends in the domestic market and the progress of digitalization, the world will probably be very different in five to ten years. We need to determine what that will look like and think about what will be the source of our competitiveness.\n\nThe second is the state of the organization. What kind of organization do we need to be successful in the future?\n\nWe need to think about what kind of management resources we need and how we will acquire them. If the source of growth is overseas business, then we need the management resources and skills to do business overseas. In terms of human capital, we need to develop global literacy, that is, employees who can be active on a global scale. Great human capital exists overseas, but Japanese companies, not just ours, are not fully utilizing it. In addition, Japanese companies are still very domestic, and there is a lack of Japanese human capital with overseas experience. There is a shortage of human capital who have expertise not only in the business side, but also on things such as internal control, as well as knowledge of overseas markets. Therefore, it is necessary to develop human capital for an aggressive approach, for defense, and to enhance global literacy.\n\nFinally, there is the state of CG. There will be no going back from trend of the times to have board with a majority of outside directors. Japanese companies are lagging behind their competitors in advanced countries in this regard. In order to create maximum value for all stakeholders, especially shareholders, it is necessary to have a more diverse and independent board of directors that not only provides decisive leadership in setting future strategies, but also thoroughly monitors the progress of the business. Shu I believe that many Japanese companies have rely too much on a bottom-up process when formulating their medium-term plans, and as a result, the vector for changing the current situation has not worked. As I mentioned earlier, it was a good thing that our Company showed leadership at the management level this time, rather than leaving it up to the field. In the process of execution, which requires delivering results, I would like everyone to be more conscious than ever of the need to demonstrate leadership from the management level.\n\nSecondly, I think we need to continue to work on improving our mindset. If the emphasis on employee value and customer value is not leading to the realization of shareholder value, then we need to change the way we provide customer value and employee value, respectively. I hope that we can create a system to tackle this issue with determination.\n\nFinally, in order to secure the human capital necessary for global strategy, expansion into areas other than life insurance such as asset management, and acceleration of digitalization, it is important to have access to a diverse and broad range of human capital beyond the internal pool of personnel. I think it will be extremely important for us to promote diversity in terms of experience rather than diversity in terms of attributes to carry out the\n\n## strategies we have set.\n\nSato What I would like to see from the executives in the medium-term management plan is to become more customer-focused. Actually, when I first became involved in Dai-ichi Life, I thought marketing was not something that was very important. The reason is that although I received many explanations, I could not see the customers beyond those sales channel strategies.\n\nHowever, in this medium-term management plan, I feel that we have taken a big step in the direction of facing customers directly by emphasizing the customer experience and including the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in key performance indicators (KPIs). At least, this is the case with domestic sales, and I have very high expectations for this change.\n\nNowadays, young people have less interest in insurance, and many of them are not at home, regardless of their age, which makes it difficult for sales staff to contact them. Then there are those who do not want to go to the trouble of visiting an agent or bank counter, and want to select insurance easier through digital channels. The needs of customers and how they purchase insurance will continue to diversify going forward. Because life insurance exists for the benefit of the customer, I would like the executives to have a more thorough understanding of who the customers are and what they are looking for. I strongly believe that we need to promote more customer-oriented products and ways to provide products that will further satisfy customers.\n\nI think there is still a lot of room for development in the domestic life insurance business. Although young people also need insurance, I think the reality is that they are not\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rather than relying on past successes, I hope that we can change our mindset and come up with new mechanisms and new ways of doing things based on the ideas of young people. I would like to see such flexibility on the part of the current executives. The domestic life insurance business in particular is the root of the Group and we have many fans, so I hope that we can be a company that can fully support them.\n\nMaeda In formulating the medium-term management plan, we had a lot of discussions about KPIs. As a holding company, our KPIs are focused on the indicators to be achieved by the entire Group, while each operating company focuses on the indicators to be achieved by its own business, and I think we have achieved a certain level of organization in this regard.\n\nAs a matter of course, the holding company will focus on financial strategic indicators, while NPS and other indicators will be classified as KPIs for the operating companies. However, the holding company will be required to work on achieving KPIs for the entire Group and at the same time monitor the progress of KPIs for each operating company. In this sense, I believe that the meetings between outside directors and the executives to exchange opinions, particularly on the monitoring of the medium-term management plan, will become increasingly important. In addition, as a precondition for this, I hope that we can go back to the basics and have thorough discussions about the functions and ideal form of the holding company in order to promote group strategies and global strategies. Masuda We have chosen a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee as an organization under the\n\nCompanies Act, and I hope that this form of governance will be viewed favorably as an advanced governance system that is comparable to companies with committees in Europe and the United States. Because it is human beings who operate the governance system, the form is important, but the substance is more important. This is my first expectation for the executives. My second expectation is to utilize the holding company structure. As a holding company, we need to effectively manage and allocate resources to the entire Group, including strategic investments such as new businesses. I think we need to have a proper discussion about what is the most important thing now and what should be prioritized, and put in practice governance with substance.\n\nAlthough this medium-term management plan is for the entire Group, the main focus is on the three life insurance companies in Japan. In terms of growth areas such as overseas business, I feel that the strategic positioning and capital investment in early-stage businesses have not been fully discussed yet, compared to Protective and TAL, which are in mature markets. Although I think that the announcement of a large share buyback, taking into account the level of the stock price, has had an effect on the stock price, I think that we need to thoroughly discuss the capital that should be invested in growth businesses with an overall sense.\n\nInoue I appreciate that the CX Design Strategy in the new medium-term management plan is based on the concept of market-in rather than product-out, which is based on products and channels, and that the concept is based on the customer's perspective.\n\nHow do we understand the values, awareness, and emotions of our customers? Three domestic companies have adopted NPS as a KPI, and we will be monitoring it. NPS is said to capture not only the functional value of products and services, but also emotional satisfaction, making it an effective indicator for measuring customer loyalty. However, there are a few points to keep in mind when using this indicator.\n\nBased on demographic trends, the percentage of millennials and Generation Z will grow significantly in the next 10 years. Individual values will also change, from ownership to usership and a growing interest in products people feel empathy with. We need to develop strategies that anticipate changes in the values and attitudes of not only existing customers but also our potential customers.\n\nIn addition, the true value of insurance products can be realized by customers when they receive insurance benefits in a distant future when the insurance event has occurred. In economic sense insurance is a 'trust,' and it is\n\ndifficult for customers to objectively evaluate the quality of the products, so NPS alone cannot fully capture the evaluation of the company by customers. Keeping these points in mind, we really need to manage business from a true customer perspective.\n\nThe implementation of the CX Design Strategy, which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Theme 4 Dialogue with Stakeholders\n\nShingai The life insurance business requires a sound financial position over the very long-term. Therefore, implementing strategies with insight into the very long-term is a top priority for management. However, we must not forget that we are kept alive by the capital market. In other words, management is required to achieve a balance between long-term soundness and business growth with short-term results. And to achieve this, I think we need to maintain an attitude of openness in which we continue to engage in sincere dialogue with our shareholders and incorporating the insights received from them with outmost openness.\n\nAt the same time, we have set up a vision to protect and enhance the happiness of all people. While the four experiential values are important, it is also very important to address the SDGs and ESGs. In doing so, we must always go back to what lies at the root of the SDGs, which is the realization of human rights to be able to live as human beings with dignity and equality, and to heal and make the earth safe. As part of this, I believe that we must consider the relationship with our stakeholders, such as society, customers, employees, shareholders, investees, and business partners, and fulfill our responsibilities and increase satisfaction of each of them.\n\nWhenever we are confused about what is right in our daily work, it is important to broaden our perspective and ask ourselves what is required of us from the perspective of the larger community.\n\nFor example, when thinking about measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or when in doubt about how to engage with investment partners or business partners, I hope that employees act with courage, thinking not about their own company's interests or the interests of their own department, but about the entire planet.\n\nAs I have experienced, the closer you get to the top of management, there are fewer employees in the company who express opinions that are painful to hear. Meanwhile, in this age of VUCA, the business environment is changing.\n\nintegrates the digital and real worlds, will require a different way of thinking, so enhancing the dynamic capability of the organization is an important medium- to long-term issue. The CG Code calls for ensuring diversity, including gender, nationality, work experience, and age, and I believe that increasing diversity is becoming even more important.\n\nThat's why it is essential for managers to have humble dialogue with stakeholders, including young people who will lead the future generation, to correct their own behavior and constantly renew the yardstick in managing the company.\n\nSato I agree with you. The term 'stakeholders' refers to the holders of stakes, which means that all interested parties are included. I believe that nowadays it is considered that everyone that has any kind of relationship with anyone is a stakeholder, not only shareholders, employees and customers, but also local communities, governments, and the global community.\n\nIf a company thinks only of specific stakeholders, it will not be able to exist at all. A good example is a company that has recently neglected dialogue with its shareholders. I think it is the most important point.\n\nEmployees are also important, and I am aware that various efforts are already being made in this area, such as setting up a contact point for internal and external reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Customers are also important because they determine the very existence of a company, so we must not make mistakes in the way we interact with them.\n\nThere are many other important matters, so I would like the executives to have a broad perspective and wide point of view, and to acquire the ability to conceptualize. I hope that they will do so in order to consider all stakeholders and respond to future changes in society. Masuda As a listed company, we are evaluated by investors, and as an institutional investor, we are also in a position to evaluate the performance of our investees, so I think we need to enhance our dialogue on sustainability with our stakeholders from both perspectives.\n\nCurrently, when Japanese companies talk about sustainability in their integrated reporting, they tend to focus only on environmental and climate issues, but in Europe and the United States, the issues are expanding to include human rights issues. For this reason, first of all, as an institutional investor, I think we need to be more sensitive than ever to the sustainability of the companies we invest in and lend to. In addition, listed companies need to be aware of the fact that they will soon be required to disclose non-financial information as well as financial information in accordance with certain standards, and may be subject to assurances and audits.\n\nIn the VUCA era, the business environment is changing rapidly on a global scale. We cannot avoid the impact of global trends, so I would like the Company to be sensitive to them.\n\nInoue The new group vision is 'the happiness of all people, including future generations' and 'the realization of a sustainable society over the next 100 years.' Because life insurance is an super-long term product, we have always managed our business with future generations in mind, but how to reflect the interests of these future stakeholders in our strategy is a difficult question. This is because although we can talk to the current generation of stakeholders, we cannot directly listen to the voices of future generations.\n\nWhat may be helpful is an experimental economics method called future design. If we use our imagination, we can see our grandchildren's grandchildren as an extension of ourselves. This method involves envisioning a hypothetical future generation group as if they were your grandchildren's grandchildren, or seven generations after you, and designing super-long term policies and strategies through negotiation role-plays with the current generation group. This method was devised to eliminate the various biases that can arise when trying to think from a super-\n\nlong term perspective as much as possible, and I hope that the Group will also devise ways to design our future based on the interests of our stakeholders 100 years in the future.\n\nMaeda In this medium-term management plan, we have adopted the concept of reconnecting, which literally means to go back to the basics and enhance connections with each stakeholder. In particular, for our customers, we will never let another incident of fraud like this one happen, we will always be aware of the level of customer satisfaction through NPS and other measures, and we will quickly build a foundation that can provide the most appropriate experience value for each customer. Another example is the adoption of TSR as a KPI to reflect interests of our shareholders. It is time for us to make bold reforms in the way our employees work, and I hope that they will make full use of DX tools to realize a way of working that is appropriate for the Group.\n\nAlso, as an institutional investor, I am aware that we have been making steady efforts from early on, including ESG-conscious investments and company-wide efforts to become carbon neutral. In addition to this integrated report, I think we need to strengthen our efforts to further deepen our recognition through various media.\n\nOlcott It has been 11 years since we were listed on the stock exchange, and the biggest issue for the Company to survive for the next 20 years is to improve our stock price evaluation. In the six years I have served as a director of the company, I am aware that the executive team has taken various measures to improve corporate value. Nonetheless, we have not always been able to obtain sufficient recognition from the capital market.\n\nIn light of this fact, in formulating the medium-term management plan last year, I felt that the executive team was more determined than ever to resolve issues that had hindered the rise of the stock price, such as improving the balance sheet problem, which can be said to be a characteristic of Japanese life insurance companies, and that the measures taken to solve the problem were more in-depth. I believe that this has led to an improvement in the capital market's evaluation and support for our stock.\n\nNow that we have completed our medium-term management plan, we have a good foundation for improving our corporate value. We now need to refocus on our earning power, while continuing our risk reduction efforts. For the long-term prosperity of the Group and all our stakeholders, we will keep a close eye on the steady implementation of the plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basic Approach to Corporate Governance\n\nThe Company has developed a system of corporate governance as stipulated in the Basic Corporate Governance Policy to ensure transparent, fair, prompt and bold decision-making while balancing supervision and management, in order to respond to\n\n## Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate Governance\n\n- Fiscal 2010 \u25cf Listed its stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (First Section) Fiscal 2015 \u25cf Established a Basic Corporate Governance Policy Fiscal 2011 \u25cf Introduced share remuneration-type stock options Fiscal 2013 \u25cf Established the Advisory Board Fiscal 2014 \u25cf Established Independence Standards for Outside Directors \u25cf Established an Internal Control Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group \u25cf Commenced self-assessment of effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited\n\n## Corporate Governance Structure\n\nIn addition to establishing an Audit and Supervisory Committee, the Company has appointed outside directors (more than one-third of its directors) and established voluntary committees\n\n## Overview of the Corporate Governance Structure\n\nthe entrustment of its multiple stakeholders, such as customers, shareholders, society and employees, and to achieve sustainable growth and enhancement of corporate value over the medium- to long-term.\n\n## Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc.\n\n## Fiscal 2016\n\n- \u25cf\n- Transitioned to a holding company structure (October 2016)\n- \u25cf Transitioned to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee (October 2016)\n- \u25cf Commenced self-assessment of the effectiveness of the Audit & Supervisory Committee\n\n## Fiscal 2017\n\n- \u25cf Commenced self-assessment of the effectiveness of Nominations Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee\n\n## Fiscal 2018\n\n\u25cf Introduced a restricted stock remuneration scheme\n\n(whose majority consists of outside directors).

Therefore, we set up the basic policy and basic principles for director and officer remuneration as well as the decision process as follows.\n\n## Basic Policy\n\n- \u25a0  Based on fair treatment\n- \u25a0  Evaluate and rewards directors and officers for their contributions to the achievement of sustainable value creation for the Group\n- \u25a0  Offer proper structure and competitive level remuneration\n\n## Basic Principles\n\n- 1. Remuneration according to responsibilities and expectations\n- 2. Consistency with strategies on which the Group focuses\n- 3. Linked to Company and individual performance\n- 4. Shares interests with all stakeholders\n- 5. Proper level of remuneration\n- 6. Ensures objectivity and transparency\n\n## Decision Process\n\nRemuneration for directors (excluding outside directors and directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members) consists of basic remuneration, performance-linked remuneration (company performance and individual performance), and restricted stock remuneration. Outside directors and directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members receive basic remuneration only. The amount of these remuneration portions is established using third party research on remuneration for management roles at Japanese companies. Moreover, the 'Policy for Determining Remuneration of Directors and Executive Officers' that includes the aforementioned Basic Policy for Remuneration of Directors and Officers and Basic Principles for Remuneration of Directors and Officers were determined by the Board of Directors following deliberation by the Remuneration Advisory Committee where outside directors make a majority of committee members.\n\n## Director Remuneration Structure\n\n|                                                                                                      | Directors (excluding directors  serving as Audit & Supervisory  Committee members)   | Directors (excluding directors  serving as Audit & Supervisory  Committee members)   | Directors (Audit  & Supervisor  Committee   | Remarks                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                      | Internal                                                                             | Outside                                                                              | members)                                    |                                                                                                               |\n| Basic amount                                                                                         |                                                                                      |                                                                                      |                                             | Remuneration according to duties and responsibilities                                                         |\n| Performance-linked amount  (company performance and  individual performance)  (short-term incentive) |                                                                                      | -                                                                                    | -                                           | Linked to the level performance indicators achievement                                                        |\n| Restricted stock amount  (long-term incentive)                                                       |                                                                                      | -                                                                                    | -                                           | Set as an incentive to achieve management objectives  and enhance corporate value in the medium- to long-term |\n\n## KPI (Key Performance Indicators) for performance-linked remuneration under 'Re-connect 2023' medium-term management plan for fiscal 2021-2023\n\n| Perspective                              | KPI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Reasons for selection                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Economic  value                          | Group ROEV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Consistent with items cited in medium-term management plan.

Because policy reserves essentially belong to policyholders, investments should be made from a long-term perspective. While, in principle, each of the Group's life insurance companies practice asset liability management focused on fixed income assets, for Dai-ichi Life in particular, which has long-term, stable, large-scale insurance liabilities, there is not a sufficiently developed super-long-term bond market to meet its super-long-term liabilities. Therefore, it is practicing balanced investment management that incorporates equities and other assets into its portfolio, in an approach that fully considers factors such as company analysis, diversifying industries and companies, and risk management, with a focus on realizing a diversifying effect through different assets. In this way, in principle, the Group companies engaged in the life insurance business hold equities for pure investment purpose as a part of their investment management. However, they partially hold shares which have combined pure investment\n\nand strategic purpose based on Group strategy, such as strengthening relationships through business alliances. Each Group company judges whether or not to reduce those holdings after performing an assessment based on the holding purpose and the cost of capital. In particular, for listed stocks, the result of the assessment at meetings of the Board of Directors are disclosed. If the appropriateness or rationale of holding such stock in terms of strategic purpose is not confirmed, and there is no meaning to hold it for pure investment purpose, it is sold.\n\n## Number of company whose equity shares are held for strategic-purpose *\n\n|   Number of  companies | Total amounts on balance sheet   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                      7 | 77.0 billion yen                 |\n\n*  Investment shares held by the Company or The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company as of the end of March 2021 for purposes other than pure investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShares Held for Strategic Purposes\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/about/control/ governance/reference.html\n\n## Improvement in the Internal Control System and its Operation\n\nDai-ichi Life Group has an internal control policy that stipulates the core philosophies for the establishment of internal control system and its operation to ensure the soundness and appropriateness of business activities in order for us to maintain and build corporate value. However, since 2020, after multiple incidents of the fraudulent mishandling of cash have come to light at The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, we, as the holding company, also recognize the existence of issues in the operation of the internal control system for the management of the entire Group. Through reinforcing communication and information linkage between our three lines of defense (business divisions, back office and administrative divisions and internal audit division), we will endeavor to boost the level of our internal control structure. Additionally, we implement internal control self-assessments that also cover Group companies to raise the effectiveness of internal controls. These assessments promote appropriate business operations by identifying major risks in each business process, evaluating the importance of each risk in terms of impact and size of losses incurred if it were to become evident, and then advancing further risk controls or business improvement measures. Through these endeavors, our business divisions will engage in their business based on autonomous risk management and our back office and administrative divisions as well as internal audit division will conduct monitoring and management reporting based on broad information-gathering. In doing so, we will adequately operate our internal control systems.\n\n## Internal Control Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group\n\n- 1.  System for Ensuring Proper Operations within the Group\n- 2.

Given that, it has become more important to ensure the appropriateness of legal compliance in business operation and to support and enhance sound operations and corporate value.\n\nDai-ichi Life Group adheres to laws, regulations, and the Articles of Incorporation, while following social norms and market rules. At the same time, we work to identify potential conduct risks.\n\nWe will continue pursuing forward-looking risk-based compliance amid the changing business environment that surrounds us.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, each Group company made preparations for business\n\n## Risk Management\n\nDai-ichi Life Group practices enterprise risk management (ERM), which is an approach to improve financial soundness and enhance corporate value simultaneously. As part of these efforts, we believe that the role of the Risk Management Department is to comprehensively grasp not only current risks but future ones as well, while avoiding and suppressing losses by reinforcing responses to those risks. The department also promotes initiatives to appropriately and proactively accept risks as the source of profit and capital. Specifically, we aim to maintain financial soundness by maintaining the risk amount within the amount of capital as we boost corporate value by improving returns against risk, which is achieved by efficiently allocating capital.\n\nAt Dai-ichi Life Group, we control financial soundness by integrating the various risks on economic value, accounting, and regulatory bases respectively, and comparing the amount of risk with our amount of capital. In internal risk control, we practice risk management while placing a high emphasis on an economic-value basis approach. For example, we are enhancing our measurement models for calculation of capital and risk amounts on an economic value basis in light of the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS), scheduled for adoption in 2025, and the discussions for economic valued-based regulation in Japan. Additionally, we have also incorporated an economicvalue basis approach in Dai-ichi Life Group's allocation of capital and product design as we pursue management that is consistent\n\noperations in a remote environment, and managed insurance procedures through means such as verifying the sufficiency of explanations provided to customer through non-face-to-face consulting. With a view to ensuring the appropriateness of business across the Group in this fashion, the Legal and Compliance Unit ascertained serious risks pertaining to compliance, and is conducting monitoring and guidance at each Group company. Important matters concerning compliance are discussed by the Group Compliance Committee, then reported to the Board of Directors, Audit & Supervisory Committee and other management bodies in order to receive instructions. In fiscal 2020, we recognized that the multiple incidents of the fraudulent mishandling of cash that came to light at The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company constitute serious events that compromise the confidence that our customers and all other stakeholders have in us. Through means such as reporting to the abovementioned management bodies and monitoring subsequent endeavors, we verify the appropriateness of those endeavors.\n\nwith risk measurement principles.\n\nAt the same time, when we identify and assess risk phenomena that cannot be entirely quantified with our models, we use past events, such as financial market turmoil and largescale disasters, as well future scenario analysis to estimate worst cases, and then carry out stress tests. We report results of stress tests along with an analysis of the impact on financial soundness to the Board of Directors, and consider strengthening our monitoring, management, and financial responses.\n\nFurthermore, Dai-ichi Life Group engages in appropriate risk management that begins from early signs of risks by identifying foreseeable risks that could have a major impact on our business and formulating business plans that take those risks into account.\n\nDai-ichi Life Group is exposed to risks such as unpredictable insurance claims in the event of widespread infectious diseases like COVID-19 and new strains of influenza. Consequently, we have identified such pandemic-related risks as material risks. Moreover, to safeguard against the further spread of COVID-19 and its prolonged effects, we carried out stress tests as part of risk management from a forward-looking perspective. The tests were based on a pandemic scenario applying major stress such as the deterioration of insurance revenue and expenditures and the worsening of financial markets. The test results confirmed that no major problem would occur with overall Group financial soundness.",

In light of the multiple incidents of the fraudulent mishandling of cash that came to light at The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company in fiscal 2020, among other factors, we recognize the importance of initiatives that contribute to the further enhancement of internal controls. Based on that recognition, as part of our internal audit activities, we verify the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control system and its operation and, in addition to identifying\n\nand observing problematic areas, conduct efforts such as issuing suggestions that pertain to the evaluation and improvement of internal control. Additionally, through regularly performing the analysis and verification of all business risks in the Group, we are working towards realizing more effective risk-based internal audits. The results of these internal audits and risk analysis and other information are regularly reported to the Board of Directors, the Executive Management Board and the Audit & Supervisory Board. Simultaneously, we endeavor to further enhance internal control system across the entire Group while cooperating with related departments and other parties.\n\n## IT Governance and Cyber-Security Measures\n\nAs our business environment changes significantly, IT is becoming a key field that has a close relationship with corporate strategy. In order to realize sustainable growth, Dai-ichi Life Group is formulating IT strategies in line with its corporate strategies and is promoting associated initiatives.\n\n## IT Governance\n\nAs the influence of IT on business management continues to grow, promoting the maximization of the value that IT brings to business and the minimization of accompanying risk through the adequate control of IT utilization will be indispensable in realizing corporate strategy. At Dai-ichi Life Group, 'Group IT Governance Basic Policy' is established and shared among the Group to promote preparedness for IT governance based on COBIT5* 1 . Based on the promotion of IT governance, we are exchanging opinions and sharing information on various IT initiatives both in Japan and overseas to create a synergy as we aim to realize IT utilization that contributes to global management. Additionally, we ask IT supervisors at Group companies in Japan and overseas to conduct a conference once a year, and are also moving forward with the examination of joint initiatives and other endeavors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has acquired 'Digital Transformation Certification' based on the DX certification system set forth by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) as a corporation that perceives business and IT systems in a unified manner and formulated management vision and business model based on the changes that digital technology has brought to society and competitive environment, and is ready to realize that vision and model.\n\n## Cyber-Security Measures\n\nIn order to safeguard information assets within the Group from cyber-attacks that become increasingly sophisticated by the day and to continue providing safety, security and stability to our customers and other stakeholders, we are currently striving to enhance our cyber-security measures in domains related to human resources and organizations, processes and technology. We have established a 'Group Cyber-security Policy' and are sharing items to promote under cyber-security measures among all Group companies. Additionally, we have established a 'CSIRT'* 2 consisting mainly of dedicated personnel with advanced expertise to bolster intra-Group preparation through means such as laying down rules and regulations regarding response to cyber-security incidents and  educating employees. Furthermore, we are making efforts to share and utilize security information through cooperating with external agencies. In doing so, from a systems aspect, we have introduced multiple systems for the detection and protection from illegal access, viruses and so forth while simultaneously pushing forward with the development of depth defense and otherwise taking countermeasures against new threats as the occasion arises. Through these initiatives, we are working toward optimizing cyber-security measures for the entire Group.\n\n- *1:  COBIT5 is a framework for gauging the level of maturity of IT governance advocated by the US-based Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and the IT Governance Institute (ITGI).\n- *2:  Computer Security Incident Response Team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For Stakeholders\n\nAt Dai-ichi Life Group, we recognize our customers, business partners, society and the environment, our employees and our shareholders as stakeholders who are deeply involved in our business activities.

March 31, 2021 increased by 10.0% compared to the previous fiscal year to 7,827.8 billion yen, consisting of 4,730.3 billion yen (3.2% decrease) in premium and other income, \uff12 ,719.5 billion yen (44.9% increase) in investment income, and 377.9 billion yen (7.3% increase) in other ordinary revenues.\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 increased by 5.5% compared to the previous fiscal year to 7,274.9 billion yen, consisting of 5,001.1 billion yen (2.7% increase) in benefits and claims, 971.2 billion yen (490.5% increase) in provision   for   policy   reserves   and   others,   326.6   billion   yen   (60.3%   decrease)   in   investment expenses, 689.0 billion yen (1.3% increase) in operating expenses, and 286.8 billion yen (19.9% decrease) in other ordinary expenses.\n\nAs a result, ordinary profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 increased by 153.2% compared to the previous fiscal year to 552.8 billion yen.Net income attributable to shareholders of parent company, which is ordinary profit after extraordinary gains and losses, provision for reserve for policyholder dividends and total of corporate income taxes, increased to 363.7 billion yen (32.4 billion yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year). This was mainly due to an increase in investment income from market factors at Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and an improvement in profit related to market value adjustment (MVA) at Dai-ichi Frontier Life.\n\nSegment results were as follows:\n\n## (1) Domestic Life Insurance Business\n\nOrdinary revenues for the domestic life insurance business increased compared to the previous fiscal year by 307.9 billion yen, or 5.2%, to 6,181.2 billion yen mainly due to an increase in gains on sale of securities at Dai-ichi Life and due to an increase in foreign exchange gains from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates at Dai-ichi Frontier Life. Segment profit increased compared to the previous fiscal year by 294.3 billion yen, or 163.6%, to 472.2 billion yen mainly due to an increase in profit related to market value adjustments (MVA) at Dai-ichi Frontier Life.\n\n## (2) Overseas Insurance Business\n\nOrdinary revenues for the overseas insurance business increased compared to the previous fiscal year by 13.7 billion yen, or 0.7%, to 1,868.1 billion yen mainly due to an increase in premium and other income at TAL Dai-ichi Life Australia Pty Ltd. Segment profit decreased compared to the previous fiscal year by 9.2 billion yen, or 11.2%, to 73.0 billion yen mainly due to the provision of allowance for currently expected credit losses in the commercial mortgage loan at Protective Life Corporation.\n\n## (3) Other Business\n\nOrdinary revenues for other business increased compared to the previous fiscal year by 3.6 billion yen, or 1.9%, to 193.4 billion yen mainly because of an increase in dividends income from the group companies. Segment profit increased compared to the previous fiscal year by 54.2 billion yen, or 44.0%, to 177.7 billion yen mainly due to record extraordinary gains from sales of ordinary shares of Janus Henderson Group plc.",

BASIS FOR PRESENTATION\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the accounts maintained by Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. (the 'Company') and its consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan ('Japanese GAAP') which are different in certain respects from the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nCertain items presented in the consolidated financial statements are reclassified for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The notes to the consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under Japanese GAAP but is presented herein as additional information.\n\nThe amounts indicated in millions of yen are rounded down by truncating the figures below one million. Totals may not add up exactly because of such truncation. Amounts in U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The rate of \u00a5110.71=US$1.00, the foreign exchange rate on March 31, 2021, has been used for translation of the truncated figures in Japanese yen. The inclusion of such amounts is not intended to imply that Japanese yen has been or could be readily converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate.\n\n## \u2161 . PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## 1.   Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe Number of consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021 was seventy-five.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, 'the Group'), including The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited ('DL'), The Dai-ichi Frontier Life Insurance Co., Ltd.

Effective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, two subsidiaries of TDLA were excluded from the scope of consolidation. Effective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, seven subsidiaries of PLC were excluded from the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe number of non-consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021 was thirty-three. The main subsidiaries that are not consolidated for the purposes of financial reporting are The Dai-ichi Life Information Systems Co., Ltd., THE DAI-ICHI BUILDING CO., LTD. and First U Anonymous Association.\n\nThe thirty-three non-consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021 had, individually and in the aggregate, a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements in terms of total assets, sales, net income (loss) (amount corresponding to equity interest), retained earnings (amount corresponding to equity interest), cash flows, and others.\n\n## 2.   Application of the Equity Method\n\nThe number of non-consolidated subsidiaries under the equity method as of March 31, 2021 was zero.\n\nThe number of affiliated companies under the equity method as of March 31, 2021 was twenty-one.

These companies had, individually and in the aggregate, a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements, in terms of the net income (loss) (amount\n\ncorresponding to equity interest), retained earnings (amount corresponding to equity interest) and others.\n\n## 3.   Year-end Dates of Consolidated Subsidiaries\n\nAmong the consolidated subsidiaries, the closing dates of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are September 30, December 31 or March 31. For those with a closing date of September 30, financial information based on the provisional closing performed on December 31 is used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. For those with a closing date of December 31 or March 31, financial information as of those closing dates is used to prepare the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNecessary adjustments are made when significant transactions take place between the account closing date of an individual subsidiary and that of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## (1) Valuation Methods of Securities\n\nSecurities held by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries including cash and deposits and monetary claims bought which are equivalent to marketable securities, and marketable securities managed as trust assets in money held in trust, are carried as explained below:\n\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is calculated by the straight-line method.\n\n## a) Trading Securities\n\nTrading securities are carried at fair value with cost determined by the moving average method.\n\n## b) Held-to-maturity Bonds\n\nHeld-to-maturity bonds are stated at amortized cost determined by the moving average method.\n\n- c) Policy-reserve-matching Bonds (in accordance with the Industry Audit Committee Report No.21 \"Temporary Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Policy-reserve-matching Bonds in the Insurance Industry\" issued by the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA))\n\nPolicy-reserve-matching bonds are stated at amortized cost determined by the moving average method.\n\n- d) Stocks of Non-consolidated Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies Not Accounted for under the Equity Method Stocks of non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies not accounted for under the equity method are stated at cost determined by the moving average method.\n\n## e) Available-for-sale Securities\n\ni) Available-for-sale Securities with Fair Values\n\nAvailable-for-sale securities which have market value are valued at fair value at the end of the fiscal year (for domestic stocks, the average market value during March), with cost determined by the moving average method.\n\nii) Available-for-sale Securities Whose Fair Values Are Extremely Difficult to Recognize\n\n- a. Government/Corporate Bonds (including Foreign Bonds), Whose Premium or Discount Represents the Interest Adjustment\n\nGovernment/corporate bonds (including foreign bonds), whose premium or discount represents the interest adjustment are valued at the amortized cost determined by the moving average method.\n\n## b. Others\n\nAll others are valued at cost determined by the moving average method.\n\nNet unrealized gains or losses on these available-for-sale securities are presented as a separate component of net assets and not in the consolidated statement of earnings.\n\nSecurities held by certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out.\n\n## (2) Valuation Method of Derivative Transactions\n\nDerivative transactions are reported at fair value.\n\n## (3) Depreciation of Depreciable Assets\n\na) Depreciation of Tangible Fixed Assets Excluding Leased Assets\n\nDepreciation of tangible fixed assets excluding leased assets of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is calculated by the declining balance method (the depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings and structures that were acquired on or before March 31, 2016) is calculated by the straight-line method).\n\nEstimated useful lives of major assets are as follows:\n\nBuildings\n\ntwo to sixty years\n\nOther tangible fixed assets\n\ntwo to twenty years\n\nOther tangible fixed assets that were acquired for \u00a5100,000 or more but less than \u00a5200,000 are depreciated at equal amounts over three years.\n\nWith respect to tangible fixed assets that were acquired on or before March 31, 2007 and that were fully depreciated to their original depreciable limit, effective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the remaining values are depreciated at equal amounts over five years from the following fiscal year of the year in which they reached the original depreciable limit.",

        "page_content": "Depreciation of tangible fixed assets owned by consolidated overseas subsidiaries is primarily calculated by the straight-line method.\n\n## b) Amortization of Intangible Fixed Assets Excluding Leased Assets\n\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries use the straight-line method for amortization of intangible fixed assets excluding leased assets.\n\nIntangible fixed assets acquired through the business combination of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are amortized over a period during which their effect is estimated, in proportion to the manner in which their effect is realized.\n\nSoftware for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of two to ten years.\n\n## c) Depreciation of Leased Assets\n\nDepreciation of leased assets with regard to finance leases whose ownership does not transfer to the lessees is computed under the straight-line method assuming zero salvage value and using the lease period as the useful life.\n\n## (4) Reserve for Possible Loan Losses\n\nThe reserve for possible loan losses of consolidated subsidiaries that operate a life insurance business in Japan is calculated based on the internal rules for self-assessment, write-offs, and reserves on assets.\n\nFor loans to and claims on obligors that have already experienced bankruptcy, reorganization, or other formal legal failure (hereafter, \"bankrupt obligors\") and loans to and claims on obligors that have suffered substantial business failure (hereafter, \"substantially bankrupt obligors\"), the reserve is calculated by deducting the estimated recoverable amount of the collateral or guarantees from the book value of the loans and claims after the direct write-off described below.\n\nFor loans to and claims on obligors that have not yet suffered business failure but are considered highly likely to fail (hereafter, \"obligors at risk of bankruptcy\"), the reserve is calculated, taking into account a) the recoverable amount covered by the collateral or guarantees and b) an overall assessment of the obligor's ability to repay.\n\nFor other loans and claims, the reserve is calculated by multiplying the actual rate or other appropriate rate of losses from bad debts during a certain period in the past by the amount of the loans and claims.\n\nFor all loans and claims, the relevant department in each subsidiary performs an asset quality assessment based on the internal rules for self-assessment, and an independent audit department audits the result of the assessment. The above reserves are established based on the result of this assessment.\n\nFor loans and claims to bankrupt and substantially bankrupt obligors, the unrecoverable amount is calculated by deducting the amount deemed recoverable from collateral and guarantees from the amount of the loans and claims and is directly written off from the amount of the loans and claims. The amounts written off during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 were \u00a51 million and \u00a51 million (US$0 million), respectively.\n\nFor certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries, reserve for their estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected is recognized for relevant claims on the date of the asset's acquisition.\n\n## (5) Reserve for Possible Investment Losses\n\nIn order to provide for future investment losses, a reserve for possible investment losses is established for securities whose fair values are extremely difficult to recognize. It is calculated based on the internal rules for self-assessment, writeoffs, and reserves on assets.\n\n## (6) Reserve for Retirement Benefits of Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Auditors\n\nFor the reserve for retirement benefits of directors, executive officers and corporate auditors, an estimated amount for future payment in accordance with the internal policies of certain consolidated subsidiaries is provided.\n\n## (7) Reserve for Possible Reimbursement of Prescribed Claims\n\nTo prepare for the reimbursement of claims for which prescription periods had expired, an estimated amount for reserve for possible reimbursement of prescribed claims based on past reimbursement experience is provided.\n\n## (8) Net Defined Benefit Liabilities\n\nFor the net defined benefit liabilities, the amount is provided by deducting the pension assets from the projected benefit obligations based on the estimated amounts as of March 31, 2021. The accounting treatment for retirement benefits is as follows.\n\n## a) Allocation of Estimated Retirement Benefits\n\nIn calculating the projected benefit obligations, the benefit formula basis is adopted to allocate estimated retirement benefit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## b) Amortization of Actuarial Differences and Past Service Cost\n\nPast service cost is amortized under the straight-line method over a certain period (seven years) within the enployees' average remaining service period as of the time of its occurrence.\n\nActuarial differences are amortized under the straight-line method over a certain period (seven years) within the employees' average remaining service period, starting from the following year. Certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries apply corridor approach.\n\nCertain consolidated overseas subsidiaries applied the simplified method in calculating their projected benefit obligations.\n\n## (9) Reserve for Price Fluctuations\n\nA reserve for price fluctuations is calculated based on the book value of stocks and other securities at the end of the year in accordance with the provisions of Article 115 of the Insurance Business Act.\n\n## (10) Translation of Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies into Yen\n\nThe Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries translate foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities (excluding stocks of its non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not accounted for under the equity method) into yen at the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the year. Stocks of non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not accounted for under the equity method are translated into yen at the exchange rates on the dates of acquisition. Assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the Company's consolidated overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the exchange rates at the end of their fiscal year.\n\nTranslation adjustments associated with the consolidated overseas subsidiaries are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, changes in fair value of bonds included in foreign currencydenominated available-for-sale securities related to foreign currency-denominated insurance contracts are divided into two: changes in fair value due to changes in market prices in their original currencies are accounted for as \"net unrealized gains (losses) on securities\", and the remaining changes are reported in \"foreign exchange gains (losses)\".\n\n## (11) Hedge Accounting\n\n## a) Methods for Hedge Accounting\n\nAs for the Company and certain of its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, hedging transactions are accounted for in accordance with the \"Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments\" (ASBJ Statement No.10 issued on March 10, 2008). Primarily, i) special hedge accounting and the deferral hedge method for interest rate swaps are used for cash flow hedges of certain loans, government and corporate bonds, loans payable and bonds payable; ii) the currency allotment method and the deferral hedge method using foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated monetary claims are used for cash flow hedges against exchange rate fluctuations in certain foreign currency-denominated bonds, loans, loans payable and bonds payable and certain foreign currencydenominated term deposits and stocks (forecasted transaction); iii) the fair value hedge method using currency options and foreign currency forward contracts is used for hedges against exchange rate fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currency-denominated bonds; iv) the deferral hedge method for bond over-the-counter options is used for hedges against interest-rate fluctuations in certain foreign currency-denominated bonds; v) the deferral hedge method and fair value hedge method using equity options and equity forward contracts are used for hedges against price fluctuations in the value of certain domestic stocks and foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction), and vi) the deferral hedge method using interest rate swaps is used for hedges against interest rate fluctuations in certain insurance liabilities, under the \"Accounting and Auditing Treatment of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments to Insurance Operators\" (Industry Audit Committee Report No. 26 issued by JICPA).\n\n## b) Hedging Instruments and Hedged Items\n\n| Hedging instruments                           | Hedged items                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps                           | Loans, government and corporate bonds, loans payable, bonds payable, insurance liabilities                                                                     |\n| Foreign currency swaps                        | Foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated loans payable, foreign currency-denominated bonds payable |\n| Foreign currency forward contracts            | Foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated term deposits, foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction)                   |\n| Foreign currency-denominated monetary  claims | Foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction)                                                                                                   |\n| Currency options                              | Foreign currency-denominated bonds                                                                                                                             |\n| Bond over-the-counter options                 | Foreign currency-denominated bonds                                                                                                                             |\n| Equity options                                | Domestic stocks, foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction)                                                                                  |\n| Equity forward contracts                      | Domestic stocks                                                                                                                                                |\n\n## c) Hedging Policies\n\nThe Company and certain of its domestic consolidated subsidiaries conduct hedging transactions with regard to",

        "page_content": "certain market risk and foreign currency risk of underlying assets to be hedged, in accordance with the internal investment policy and procedure guidelines.\n\n## d) Assessment of Hedge Effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed primarily by a comparison of fluctuations in cash flows or fair value of hedged items to those of hedging instruments.\n\n## (12) Amortization of Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is amortized over an effective period up to 20 years under the straight-line method. The entire amount is expensed as incurred if the amount is immaterial.\n\n## (13) Scope of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition, which are readily convertible into cash and have an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## (14) Calculation of National and Local Consumption Tax\n\nThe Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries account for national and local consumption tax mainly by the tax-exclusion method. Deferred consumption tax included in non-recoverable consumption tax on certain assets is capitalized as other assets and amortized equally over five years in accordance with the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act, and such taxes other than deferred consumption tax are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\n## (15) Policy Reserves\n\nPolicy reserves of consolidated subsidiaries that operate a life insurance business in Japan are established in accordance with the methods stated in the statement of calculation procedures for policy reserves (Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 4 of the Insurance Business Act) pursuant to Article 116, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act, for insurance contracts under which the insurer's liability has started as of the end of the fiscal year, in preparation for the performance of future obligations under the insurance contracts. Concretely, policy reserves are calculated based on the future cash flows estimated using the assumptions, such as future mortality rates (assumed mortality rates), return on investment (assumed interest rates) and operating expense ratios (assumed operating expense ratios).\n\nOf policy reserves, insurance premium reserves are calculated by the following methods.\n\n- a) Reserves for policies subject to the standard policy reserve rules are calculated based on the methods stipulated by the Commissioner of Financial Services Agency (Notification of the Minister of Finance No. 48, 1996).\n\nb) Reserves for other policies are established based on the net level premium method.\n\nIf, through an estimation of future income based on most recent actual figures, the policy reserves set aside are found likely to be insufficient to cover the performance of future obligations, additional policy reserves need to be set aside in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act. Policy reserves include additional policy reserves for some whole life insurance policies in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.\n\nContingency reserves included in policy reserves are set aside in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act to cover risks that may accrue in the future in order to ensure the performance of future obligations under insurance contracts.\n\nPolicy reserves of consolidated subsidiaries that operate a life insurance business in the U.S. are set aside in accordance with US GAAP in amounts calculated by estimated future cash flows based on actuarial assumptions determined at times such as when the contracts are concluded, including future investment yields, mortality and lapse rates. If the policy reserves set aside are found likely to be insufficient to cover the performance of future obligations due to a significant difference between the estimation and the most recent actual figures, additional policy reserves need to be set aside by way of amendment to the assumptions.\n\nPolicy reserves of other overseas subsidiaries are calculated based on the each country's accounting standard.\n\n## (16) Premium and Other Income and Benefits and Claims for Consolidated Subsidiaries That Operate a Life Insurance Business in Japan\n\n## a) Premium and other income (excluding reinsurance income)\n\nPremium and other income (excluding reinsurance income) is recorded for insurance contracts for which insurance premium has been received and under which the insurer's liability has commenced by the relevant amounts received.\n\nOf premium and other income (excluding reinsurance income), the portion corresponding to the period that has yet to pass as of the end of the fiscal year is set aside as policy reserves in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.\n\n## b) Reinsurance Income\n\nReinsurance income is recorded as amounts equivalent to the portion reinsured under reinsurance contracts out of the amounts paid as claims, etc. under direct insurance contracts at the time when those claims, etc. are paid. For certain transactions of modified coinsurance that do not involve cash settlements, amounts received under the\n\nreinsurance contracts as part of amounts equivalent to acquisition costs related to direct insurance contracts are recorded as reinsurance income while the same amounts are recorded as unamortized ceded premium commissions in\n\nreinsurance receivable and are amortized over the period of the reinsurance contracts.\n\n## c) Benefits and Claims (excluding ceding reinsurance commissions)\n\nBenefits and claims (excluding ceding reinsurance commissions) are recorded for contracts for which amounts calculated under policy conditions have been paid in the occurrence of insured events under the policy conditions by the relevant amounts paid.\n\nIn accordance with Article 117 of the Insurance Business Act, reserves for outstanding claims are set aside for claims, etc. for which the Company has a payment due but has not paid, or for which the occurrence of the insured events have not been reported but the Company finds that insured events have already occurred, as of the end of the fiscal year.\n\n## d) Ceding reinsurance commissions\n\nCeding reinsurance commissions are recorded in agreed amounts in accordance with reinsurance contracts at the time either when insurance premiums under direct insurance contracts are received, or when the reinsurance contracts are entered into.\n\nPart of policy reserves and reserves for outstanding claims corresponding to insurance contracts which have been reinsured is not set aside in accordance with Article 71, Paragraph 1 and Article 73, Paragraph 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.\n\nPremium and other income, and benefits and claims, of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are recorded based on the each country's accounting standard, such as US GAAP.\n\n## (Additional information)\n\nEffective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company discloses \"principles and procedures of the accounting treatment adopted in cases where the provisions of relevant accounting standards, etc. are unclear\" with the adoption of the \"Accounting Standard for Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections\" (ASBJ Statement No. 24 revised on March 31, 2020), in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (17) Significant Accounting Estimates\n\na) Evaluation of goodwill\n\ni) Amounts recognized on the consolidated financial statements in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 Goodwill presented on the consolidated balance sheets in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 comprises goodwill of \u00a510,030 million (US$90 million) arising from the acquisition of PLC and the acquisition business of PLC's acquisition segment and goodwill of \u00a532,666 million (US$295 million) arising from the acquisition of TDLA.\n\n- ii) Information on the contents of significant accounting estimates related to identified items\n\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions and acquisition business is recorded on the consolidated financial statements of these consolidated subsidiaries and is subject to judgement on recognition of impairment losses on goodwill to be examined by each subsidiary in accordance with the local accounting standards of each subsidiary.\n\nPLC evaluates qualitative factors, which is examination on whether or not there is any impairment indicator, to consider whether or not there is a 50 percent or greater probability that book value exceeds fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill. Whether or not there is any impairment indicator is comprehensively examined in consideration of the presence of deterioration in economic and market environments surrounding PLC and its reporting units, the presence of factors that have a negative impact on future profits or cash flows, the presence of deterioration in overall business performance, and other events specific to PLC and its reporting units. If there is any impairment indicator which is attributable to the deterioration of circumstances or the occurrence of events, impairment losses on goodwill may be recorded in the following fiscal year.\n\nTDLA performs quantitative impairment test by comparing book value with recoverable amount in each cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated. Recoverable amount is calculated based on embedded values, etc. For calculating the embedded values, underlying actuarial assumptions are used such as discount rates, mortality, morbidity, discontinuances and others. If recoverable amount reduces due to the update of underlying actuarial assumptions, impairment losses on goodwill may be recorded in the following fiscal year.\n\nThe Company judges as to whether or not there is any impairment indicator of goodwill in accordance with the accounting standards in Japan, considering the results of the judgements made by each subsidiary. No impairment losses on goodwill are recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as the Company determined that there was no impairment indicator on goodwill.\n\n## b) Evaluation of value of in-force insurance contracts\n\ni) Amounts recognized on the consolidated financial statements in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021\n\nOther intangible fixed assets presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 includes assets regarding the present value of in-force insurance contracts, namely Value of Business Acquired ('VOBA') or Value In-force ('VIF'). The balance of VOBA in the amount of \u00a5186,370 million (US$1,683 million) is derived from the acquisition of PLC and the acquisition business of PLC's acquisition segment, and the balance of VIF in the amount of \u00a523,666 million (US$213 million) is derived from the acquisitions of TDLA, respectively. ii) Information on the contents of significant accounting estimates related to identified items\n\nThe value of in-force insurance contracts arising from acquisitions and acquisition business is calculated as the present value of future profits to be earned from future cash flows arising from in-force insurance contracts and investment type insurance contracts at the acquisition date, and is recorded on the consolidated financial statements of these consolidated subsidiaries while the value of in-force insurance contracts is amortized over a period during which its effect is estimated, in proportion to the manner in which its effect is realized.",

        "page_content": "The VOBA of PLC is amortized based on future gross premiums, estimated gross margins, contractual terms and/or others.\n\nWith regards to the VOBA arising from investment type insurance contracts, PLC regularly reviews actuarial assumptions, such as interest rates, mortality and lapse rates, and updates them if necessary, and accordingly increases or decreases amortization amount of the VOBA. Where increase or decrease in estimated gross margins is expected due to the change in lapse, the update of actuarial assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in the following fiscal year.\n\nPLC assesses whether the VOBA arising from traditional insurance contracts is impaired concurrently with performing liability adequacy test of relevant policy reserves in addition to the predetermined amortization. The VOBA arising from traditional insurance contracts may result in impairment losses in the following fiscal year prior to providing additional policy reserves where the estimated future cash flows based on the underlying actuarial assumptions determined upon conclusion of contract, such as future investment yields, mortality and lapse rates differ significantly from actual and it is recognized that there is a risk of disabling to fulfill future obligations. No impairment losses on the VOBA are recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nTDLA assesses the VIF arising from the acquisition of TDLA as to whether there is any impairment indicator of the VIF at the same time as goodwill impairment test is performed because impairment of goodwill indicates impairment of the VIF. No impairment losses are recognized in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as the TDLA determined that there was no indication that the VIF is impaired based on the result of the quantitative impairment test on goodwill.\n\n## (18) Policy Acquisition Costs\n\nThe costs of acquiring and renewing policies, which include agent commissions and certain other costs directly related to the acquisition of policies, are expensed when incurred as the Insurance Business Act in Japan does not permit insurance companies to defer and amortize these costs.\n\n## (19) Changes in Accounting Policies - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n\nEffective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe update is mainly applied to financial instruments valued at amortized cost and introduce a new current expected credit loss model. This model requires that an entity recognize as an allowance its estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected on day one of the asset's acquisition.\n\nIn accordance with the amendments in this update applied on a modified retrospective basis, a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was recorded at the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nAs a result, reserve for possible loan losses increased by \u00a59,953 million (US$91 million), and retained earnings decreased by \u00a515,150 million (US$139 million). In addition, ordinary profit and income before income taxes each declined by \u00a515,207 million (US$137 million).\n\nThe impact on the figures in per share information is described XIX. PER SHARE INFORMATION.\n\n## (20) Accounting Standard and Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nFinancial Services - Insurance (Topic 944) (ASU No. 2018-12 issued on August 15, 2018, ASU No. 2019-09 issued on November 15, 2019, and ASU No. 2020-11 issued on November 5, 2020)\n\n## a) Outline\n\nThe amendments in this Update are mainly designed to make improvements of (i) the accounting treatment of the liability for future policy benefits, (ii) the measurement of benefits with market risks at fair value, and (iii) the amortization methods of deferred acquisition costs of insurance contracts.\n\nCompanies that have adopted US GAAP will apply the amendments in this Update from the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022 (early adoption is permitted).\n\n## b) Scheduled date for adoption\n\nCertain consolidated overseas subsidiaries that have adopted US GAAP will apply the amendments in this Update, but the date for application is undetermined.\n\n## c) Impact of applying the standard and guidance\n\nThe impact of applying the standard and guidance is currently under assessment.\n\n## (21) Changes in Presentation Method\n\nEffective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has adopted Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates (ASBJ Statement No.31 issued on March 31, 2020), and accordingly discloses the notes to significant accounting estimates in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRegarding this note, in accordance with transitional treatment stipulated in provision of Paragraph 11 of the said Accounting Standard, the contents for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 are not disclosed.\n\n(Additional information)\n\n## Incentive Programs for Employees\n\nThe Company conducts transactions by granting its stocks to its employees using trust scheme (\"the Stock Granting Trust (J-ESOP)\") to incentivize its employees to improve stock prices and financial results.\n\n## a) Overview of the transactions\n\nJ-ESOP is a program to grant stocks of the Company to the employees who fulfill requirements under the Stock Granting Regulations of the Company and its group companies. The Company vests points to each managerial level employee based on her/his contribution, and vests stocks based on total points at retirement. Such stocks, including stocks to be granted in the future, are purchased by money held in the J-ESOP trust, managed separately from book of the Company.\n\n- b) While adopting \"Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company's Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts.\" (ASBJ PITF No. 30), the Company applies the same accounting treatment as before.\n- c) Information related to the stocks of the Company which the trusts hold\n- i) Book value of the stocks of the Company within the trust as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 were \u00a56,149 million and \u00a55,960 million (US$53 million), respectively. These stocks were recorded as the treasury stock in the total shareholders' equity.\n- ii) The number of stocks within the trust as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 were 4,068 thousand shares and 3,942 thousand shares, and the average number of stocks within the trust for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 were 4,097 thousand shares and 3,991 thousand shares, respectively. The number of shares at the year-end and the average number of stocks were included in the treasury stock, which is deducted when calculating per-share information.",

Each property for rent and property not in use, which is not used for insurance business purposes, is deemed to be an independent asset group.\n\n## b) Background for Recognition of Impairment Losses\n\nAs a result of significant declines in profitability or market value of some asset groups, the consolidated subsidiaries wrote down the book value of these assets to the recoverable value, and reported such write-off as impairment losses in extraordinary losses.\n\n## c) Breakdown of Impairment Losses\n\nImpairment losses by asset group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were as follows:\n\n| Asset Group               | Place                                          | Number              | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                           |                                                |                     | Land                | Buildings           | Total               |\n|                           |                                                | (Unit: million yen) |                     |                     |                     |\n| Real estate for rent      | Morioka city,Iwate  Prefecture                 | 1                   | 29                  | 35                  | 64                  |\n| Real estate    not in use | Nishinomiya  city,Hyogo Prefecture  and others | 22                  | 2,238               | 1,253               | 3,491               |\n| Total                     | -                                              | 23                  | 2,267               | 1,288               | 3,556               |\n\nImpairment losses by asset group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n| Asset Group                 | Place                          | Number   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                             |                                |          | Land                | Buildings           | Total               | Land                       | Buildings                  | Total                      |\n|                             |                                |          | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) |\n| Real estate  for rent       | Morioka city,Iwate  Prefecture | 1        | 25                  | 31                  | 57                  | 0                          | 0                          | 0                          |\n| Real estate      not in use | Takamatsu  city,Kagawa         |          |                     |                     |                     |                            |                            |                            |\n| Total                       | Prefecture and others -        | 22 23    | 1,741 1,767         | 752 784             | 2,494 2,552         | 15 15                      | 6 7                        | 22 23                      |\n\n## d) Calculation of Recoverable Value\n\nValue in use or net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate for rent, and net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate not in use. Discount rates of 2.22% and 2.17% for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, were applied for discounting future cash flows in the calculation of value in use. Estimated disposal value, appraisal value based on real estate appraisal standards, or appraisal value based on publicly assessed land value for tax purposes is used as the net sale value.",

Financial Instruments\n\n## (1) Policies in Utilizing Financial Instrument\n\nThe Group mainly operates in life insurance business and, in an effort to manage investment assets in a manner appropriate to liabilities, which arise from the insurance policies underwritten, engages in asset liability management, or ALM, which considers the long-term balance between assets and liabilities to ensure stable returns. With this strategy, the Group holds fixed income investments, including bonds and loans, as the core of its asset portfolio. While placing its financial soundness first, the Group also holds stocks and foreign securities within its tolerable risk to enhance its profitability and facilitate diversification of investment risks.\n\nThe Group uses derivatives primarily to hedge market risks associated with its existing asset portfolio and to mitigate the risks associated with guaranteed minimum maturity benefits of individual variable annuity insurance.\n\nWith respect to financing, the Group has raised capital directly from the capital markets by issuing subordinated bonds as well as indirectly from banks in order to strengthen its capital base. To avoid impact from interest-rate fluctuations, the Group utilizes derivative transactions in hedging some of such financial liabilities and adopts hedge accounting.\n\n## (2) Financial Instruments Used and Their Risks\n\nSecurities included in financial assets of the Group, mainly stocks and bonds, are exposed to market fluctuation risk, credit risk and interest-rate risk and some of the securities denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign currency risk. Also, loans are exposed to credit risk arising from the defaults of obligors.\n\nThe Group might be exposed to liquidity risk in certain circumstance in which it cannot make timely payments of principal, interest or other amounts due to unpredictable cash outflows or is forced to raise capital with interest rates substantially higher than usual. Also, some of its loans payable and bonds payable which are floating interest rate based and denominated in foreign currency are exposed to interest-rate risk and foreign currency risk.\n\nThe Group utilizes a) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain of its loans receivable and payable, b) equity forward contracts to hedge market fluctuation risks associated with domestic stocks, and c) foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and foreign currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated short-term deposits and foreign currencydenominated debts, etc. and adopts hedge accounting.\n\nIn addition, certain consolidated subsidiaries utilize a) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain insurance liabilities, under the \"Accounting and Auditing Treatment of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments to Insurance Operators\" (JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 26), and b) foreign currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risks associated with funding agreements and adopts hedge accounting.\n\nIn applying the hedge accounting, in order to fulfill requirements stipulated in accounting standards such as the \"Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments\" (ASBJ Statement No. 10 issued on March 10, 2008), the Group has established investment policy and procedure guidelines and clarified the transactions to be hedged, the risk of underlying assets to be hedged and derivative instruments to be used, and conducted pre- and post-effectiveness tests of the transactions.\n\n## (3) Risk Management\n\nThe Group manages risk in accordance with a basic policy for risk management, rules for management procedures, etc. defined by the board of directors, etc.\n\n## a) Market risk management\n\nUnder the internal investment policy and market risk management policy, DL manages market risk by conducting midto long-term asset allocation in a manner appropriate to its liabilities. Therefore, it categorizes its portfolio into subgroups, based on their investment purpose, and manages them taking into account each of their risk characteristics. i) Interest rate risk\n\nDL keeps track of interest rates and durations of its assets and liabilities, monitors its internal analyses on duration gap and interest rate sensitivity, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## ii) Currency risk\n\nDL keeps track of currency composition of its financial assets and liabilities, conducts sensitivity analyses, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## iii) Fluctuation in market values\n\nDL defines risk management policies and management procedures for each component of its overall portfolio, including securities, based on the risk characteristics of the categories, and sets and manages upper limits of each asset balance and asset allocation weight.\n\nSuch management conditions are periodically reported by its risk management sections to the board of directors,\n\n## etc.\n\n## iv) Derivative transactions\n\nFor derivative transactions, DL has established internal check system by segregating (i) the executing department, (ii) the department which engages in assessment of hedge effectiveness, and (iii) the back-office. Additionally, in order to limit speculative use of derivatives, it has put restrictions on utilization purpose, such as hedging, and establishes position limits for each asset class.\n\nThe consolidated subsidiaries other than DL have established appropriate risk management systems in accordance with the Group's basic policy for risk management, etc.\n\nDFLI utilizes derivatives in order to reduce the risk associated with guaranteed minimum maturity benefits of individual variable annuities and hedge foreign currency risks associated with bonds. For derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with guaranteed minimum maturity benefits of individual variable annuities, in accordance with its internal regulations to manage the risks associated with its guaranteed minimum maturity benefits, it (i) assesses the hedge effectiveness of derivative transactions, (ii) manages gains and losses from derivative transactions on a daily basis, and (iii) periodically checks its progress on reducing the risk associated with its guaranteed minimum maturity benefits and measures estimated losses based on VaR (value-at-risk). The risk management section is in charge of managing overall risks including risks associated with the guaranteed minimum maturity benefits, and periodically reports the status of such management to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## b) Credit Risk Management\n\nIn accordance with the internal investment policy and credit risk management procedure guidelines, DL has established a credit management system related to loans, such as preliminary reviews on individual transactions, credit limit setting, credit information management, internal credit rating, attachment of guarantees and collateral, and followups on problem loans. For corporate bond investment, the credit section sets investment caps on individual issuers taking into account internal credit ratings and other factors. Excessive risk-taking is restricted since front offices make investment within those caps. Policies and frameworks for large-lot borrowers have been formulated in order to prevent credit concentration by monitoring compliance, etc. That credit management has been conducted by the credit and risk management sections, and has been periodically reported to its board of directors, etc. Additionally, the internal audit section has also checked credit management status.\n\nCredit risk of security issuers and counterparty risk with respect to derivative transactions are managed by the credit section, which sets upper limits for each counterparty and financial instrument and periodically monitors credit information, and by the risk management section, which periodically monitors current exposures.\n\nThe consolidated subsidiaries other than DL have established appropriate risk management systems in accordance with the Group's basic policy for risk management, etc.\n\n## (4) Supplementary Explanation for Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nAs well as the values based on market prices, fair value of financial instruments includes values which are reasonably calculated in case market prices do not exist. As the calculation of those values adopts certain assumptions, those values may vary in case different assumptions are applied. Also, for the contract value regarding derivative transactions described in \"2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\", the \"Notional amount/contract value\" itself does not indicate market risk related to derivative transactions.",

Figures in [   ] are net debts.\n\nNote 1: Notes to Methods for Calculating Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Securities and Derivative Transactions Assets\n\n## (1) Cash and deposits\n\nSince deposits are mainly close to maturity or have no maturity and their fair value is close to the carrying amounts, fair value is based on the carrying amount.\n\n## (2) Call loans\n\nSince all call loans are close to due date and their fair value is close to carrying amounts, fair value of call loans is based on their carrying amount.\n\n## (3) Monetary claims bought\n\nThe fair value of monetary claims bought is based on the reasonably calculated price.\n\n## (4) Money held in trust\n\nThe fair value of stocks is based on the price on stock exchanges and that of bonds is based on the price on bond markets or price presented by counterparty financial institutions. The fair value of mutual funds is based on unit price. For details on derivative transactions of money held in trust, please refer to XII. DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.\n\n## (5) Securities\n\nThe fair value of stocks is based on the price on stock exchanges and that of bonds is based on the price on bond markets or price presented by counterparty financial institutions. The fair value of mutual funds is based on unit price. As for ownership stakes in partnerships, the amount equivalent to partnership interest in fair value of the partnership assets is recorded as fair value of the stake in the partnership. Additionally, notes for the securities for each investment purpose are described in X. SECURITIES.\n\n## (6) Loans\n\nThe fair value of loans is calculated by discounting future cash flows of the subject loan, using interest rates corresponding to the internal credit rating and remaining period which are assumed to be applied to new loans to the subject borrower.\n\nAdditionally, for risk-monitored loans, reserve for possible loan losses is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows or the amount deemed recoverable from collateral and guarantees and the fair value is close to the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet minus reserve for possible loan losses at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, that amount (the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet minus reserve for possible loan losses) is recorded as the fair value of risk-monitored loans.\n\nAlso, loans without a due date because of their characteristics that their exposure is limited to the amount of their collaterals, are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account estimated repayment period and interest rates. Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value.\n\n## (7) Reinsurance receivable\n\nSince the fair value of reinsurance receivable is close to the carrying amounts, fair value is based on the carrying amount.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n## (1) Bonds payable\n\nThe fair value of bonds is based on the price on the bond market.\n\n## (2) Payables under repurchase agreements\n\nSince the terms of all payables under repurchase agreements are short and their fair value is close to the carrying amounts, fair value is based on the carrying amount.\n\n## (3) Long-term borrowings\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting future cash flows, using interest rates corresponding to internal credit rating and remaining periods which are assumed to be applied to new borrowing. Also, certain of long-term borrowings are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account interest rates. Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nFor details on derivative transactions, please refer to XII. DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.\n\nNote 2: Financial instruments whose fair value is extremely difficult to recognize are as follows and are not included in the fair value of (5) Securities in Note 1\n\n|                                       | As of March 31,     | As of March 31,     | As of March 31,            |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                       | 2020                | 2021                | 2021                       |\n|                                       | Carrying amount     | Carrying amount     | Carrying amount            |\n|                                       | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million US dollars) |\n| 1.

Reclassification of Securities\n\nEffective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, policy-reserve-matching bonds held in the sub-group of individual life insurance and annuities (Australian dollar-denominated) were reclassified into available-for-sale securities.\n\nDue to this change, as of the time of reclassification, securities, net unrealized gains (losses) on securities and deferred tax liabilities increased by \u00a5204,207 million, \u00a5147,029 million, and \u00a557,177 million, respectively. This change had no impact on profit and loss.\n\n## 9.   Securities Written Down\n\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries write down the balance of certain available-for-sale securities with fair values (1) when the fair value of such securities declines by 50%, or more, of its purchase cost or (2) when the fair value of such securities without a certain level of creditworthiness declines by 30% or more, but less than 50%, of its purchase cost unless it is deemed that there is a possibility that the fair value of the security could recover to equal or exceed the purchase cost. The aggregate amounts written down from the balance of available-for-sale securities with fair value for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 were \u00a560,427 million and \u00a513,108 million (US$118 million), respectively.\n\n## XI.

BASIS FOR PRESENTATION\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared from the accounts maintained by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (the \"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiary in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Insurance Business Act and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (\"Japanese GAAP\") which are different in certain respects from the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nCertain items presented in the consolidated financial statements are reclassified for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The notes to the consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under Japanese GAAP but is presented herein as additional information.\n\nThe amounts indicated in millions of yen are rounded down by truncating the figures below one million. Totals may not add up exactly because of such truncation. Amounts in U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The rate of \u00a5110.71=US$1.00, the foreign exchange rate on March 31, 2021, has been used for translation of the truncated figures in Japanese yen. The inclusion of such amounts is not intended to imply that Japanese yen has been or could be readily converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate.\n\n## \u2161 . GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1.   Scope of Consolidation\n\n(1) The number of consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021: 1\n\nThe subsidiary of the Company included:\n\n- \u00b7 Dai-ichi Life Insurance Myanmar Ltd.\n\n## (2) The number of non-consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021: 23\n\n- The main subsidiaries that are not consolidated for the purposes of financial reporting are The Dai-ichi Life Information Systems Co., Ltd., Dai-ichi Life Business Services Co., Ltd. and First U Anonymous Association. The twenty-three non-consolidated subsidiaries had, individually and in the aggregate, a minimal impact on the consolidated\n\nfinancial statements in terms of total assets, sales, net income (loss) (amount corresponding to equity interest), retained earnings (amount corresponding to equity interest), cash flows, and others.\n\n## 2.   Application of the Equity Method\n\n(1) The number of non-consolidated subsidiaries under the equity method as of March 31, 2021: 0\n\n## (2) The number of affiliated companies under the equity method as of March 31, 2021: 2\n\nThe affiliated companies of the Company included:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate-pension Business Service Co., Ltd.,\n- \u00b7 Japan Excellent Asset Management Co., Ltd.,\n\n(3) The non-consolidated subsidiaries (The Dai-ichi Life Information Systems Co., Ltd., Dai-ichi Life Business Services Co., Ltd., First U Anonymous Association and others), as well as affiliated companies (Mizuho-DL Financial Technology Co., Ltd., and Rifare Management K.K.) were not accounted for under the equity method. These companies had, individually and in the aggregate, a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements, in terms of net income (loss) (amount corresponding to equity interest), retained earnings (amount corresponding to equity interest) and others.\n\n## 3.   Year-end Dates of a Consolidated Subsidiary\n\nThe closing date of a consolidated subsidiary is September 30. Financial information as of December 31 is used to prepare the consolidated financial statements, although necessary adjustments are made when significant transactions take place between the account closing date of an individual subsidiary and that of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## \u2162 . NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n\n## 1.   Valuation Methods of Securities\n\nSecurities held by the Company and its consolidated subsidiary including cash and deposits and monetary claims bought which are equivalent to marketable securities, and marketable securities managed as trust assets in money held in trust, are carried as explained below:\n\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is calculated by the straight-line method.\n\n- (1) Trading Securities\n\nTrading securities are carried at fair value with cost determined by the moving average method.",

Risk Management Policy of Policy-Reserve-Matching Bonds\n\nThe Company categorizes its insurance products into sub-groups by the attributes of each product and, in order to manage risks properly, formulates its policies on investments and resource allocation based on the balance of the sub-groups. Moreover, the Company periodically checks that the duration gap between policy-reserve-matching bonds and policy reserves stays within a certain range.\n\nThe sub-groups of insurance products of the Company are:\n\n- \u00b7 individual life insurance and annuities,\n- \u00b7 non-participating single premium whole life insurance (without duty of medical disclosure),\n- \u00b7 financial insurance and annuities, and\n- \u00b7 group annuities,\n\nwith the exception of certain types.\n\n## 3.   Valuation Method of Derivative Transactions\n\nDerivative transactions are reported at fair value.\n\n## 4.   Revaluation of Land\n\nBased on the \"Act on Revaluation of Land\" (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998), land for business use was revalued. The difference between the fair value and book value resulting from the revaluation, net of related deferred taxes, is recorded as a reserve for land revaluation as a separate component of net assets and the related deferred tax liability is recorded as deferred tax liabilities for land revaluation.\n\n- \u00b7 Date of revaluation: March 31, 2001\n- \u00b7 Method stipulated in Article 3 Paragraph 3 of the Act on Revaluation of Land:\n\nThe fair value was determined based on the appraisal value publicly announced for tax assessment purposes with certain reasonable adjustments in accordance with Articles 2-1 and 2-4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land (Publicly Issue Cabinet Order No.119, March 31, 1998).\n\n## 5.   Depreciation of Depreciable Assets\n\n## (1) Depreciation of Tangible Fixed Assets Excluding Leased Assets\n\nDepreciation of tangible fixed assets excluding leased assets of the Company is calculated by the declining balance method (the depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings and structures that were acquired on or before March 31, 2016) is calculated by the straight-line method).\n\nEstimated useful lives of major assets are as follows:\n\nBuildings\n\ntwo to sixty years\n\nOther tangible fixed assets\n\ntwo to twenty years\n\nOther tangible fixed assets that were acquired for \u00a5100,000 or more but less than \u00a5200,000 are depreciated at equal amounts over three years.\n\nWith respect to tangible fixed assets that were acquired on or before March 31, 2007 and that were fully depreciated to their original depreciable limit, effective the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the remaining values are depreciated at equal amounts over five years from the following fiscal year of the year in which they reached the original depreciable limit. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets owned by a consolidated overseas subsidiary is calculated by the straight-line\n\nmethod.\n\n## (2) Amortization of Intangible Fixed Assets Excluding Leased Assets\n\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiary use the straight-line method for amortization of intangible fixed assets excluding leased assets.\n\nSoftware for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of five years.\n\n## (3) Depreciation of Leased Assets\n\nDepreciation for leased assets with regard to finance leases whose ownership does not transfer to the lessees is computed under the straight-line method assuming zero salvage value and using the lease period as the useful life.\n\n## (4) Accumulated Depreciation of Tangible Fixed Assets\n\nAccumulated depreciation of tangible fixed assets as of March 31, 2021 was \u00a5622,564 million (US$5,623 million).\n\n## 6.   Translation of Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies into Yen\n\nThe Company translates foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities (excluding stocks of its non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not accounted for under the equity method) into yen at the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the fiscal year. Stocks of non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not accounted for under the equity method are translated into yen at the exchange rates on the dates of acquisition. Assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the Company's consolidated overseas subsidiary are translated into yen at the exchange rates at its account closing date. Translation adjustments associated with the consolidated overseas subsidiary are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 7.   Reserve for Possible Loan Losses\n\nThe reserve for possible loan losses is calculated based on the internal rules for self-assessment, write-offs, and reserves on assets.\n\nFor loans to and claims on obligors that have already experienced bankruptcy, reorganization, or other formal legal failure (hereafter, \"bankrupt obligors\") and loans to and claims on obligors that have suffered substantial business failure (hereafter, \"substantially bankrupt obligors\"), the reserve is calculated by deducting the estimated recoverable amount of the collateral or guarantees from the book value of the loans and claims after the direct write-off described below.\n\nFor loans to and claims on obligors that have not yet suffered business failure but are considered highly likely to fail (hereafter, \"obligors at risk of bankruptcy\") the reserve is calculated, taking into account (1) the recoverable amount covered by the collateral or guarantees and (2) an overall assessment of the obligor's ability to repay.\n\nFor other loans and claims, the reserve is calculated by multiplying the actual rate or other appropriate rate of losses from bad debts during a certain period in the past by the amount of the loans and claims.\n\nFor all loans and claims, the relevant department in the Company performs an asset quality assessment based on the internal rules for self-assessment, and an independent audit department audits the result of the assessment. The above reserves are established based on the result of this assessment.\n\nFor loans and claims to bankrupt and substantially bankrupt obligors, the unrecoverable amount is calculated by deducting the amount deemed recoverable from collateral and guarantees from the amount of the loans and claims and is directly written off from the amount of the loans and claims. The amount written off during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was \u00a51 million (US$0 million).",

Reserve for Possible Investment Losses\n\nIn order to provide for future investment losses, a reserve for possible investment losses is established for securities whose fair values are extremely difficult to recognize. It is calculated based on the internal rules for self-assessment, write-offs, and reserves on assets.\n\n## 9.   Reserve for Retirement Benefits of Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Auditors\n\nFor the reserve for retirement benefits of directors, executive officers and corporate auditors, an estimated amount for future payment in accordance with the internal policies is provided.\n\n## 10.  Reserve for Possible Reimbursement of Prescribed Claims\n\nTo prepare for the reimbursement of claims for which prescription periods had expired, an estimated amount for reserve for possible reimbursement of prescribed claims based on past reimbursement experience is provided.\n\n## 11.  Net Defined Benefit Liabilities\n\nFor the net defined benefit liabilities, the amount is provided by deducting the pension assets from the projected benefit obligations based on the estimated amounts as of March 31, 2021. The accounting treatment for retirement benefits is as follows.\n\n## (1) Allocation of Estimated Retirement Benefits\n\nIn calculating the projected benefit obligations, the benefit formula basis is adopted to allocate estimated retirement benefit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## (2) Amortization of Actuarial Differences and Past Service Cost\n\nPast service cost is amortized under the straight-line method over a certain period (seven years) within the employees' average remaining service period as of the time of its occurrence.\n\nActuarial differences are amortized under the straight-line method over a certain period (seven years) within the employees' average remaining service period, starting from the following year.\n\n## 12.  Reserve for Price Fluctuations\n\nA reserve for price fluctuations is calculated based on the book value of stocks and other securities at the end of the year in accordance with the provisions of Article 115 of the Insurance Business Act.\n\n## 13.  Hedge Accounting\n\n(1) Methods for Hedge Accounting\n\nAs for the Company, hedging transactions are accounted for in accordance with the \"Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments\" (ASBJ Statement No. 10 issued on March 10, 2008). Primarily, (a) special hedge accounting and the deferral hedge method for interest rate swaps are used for cash flow hedges of certain loans, government and corporate bonds, loans payable and bonds payable; (b) the currency allotment method and the deferral hedge method using foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are used for cash flow hedges against exchange rate fluctuations in certain foreign currency-denominated bonds, loans, loans payable and bonds payable and certain foreign currency-denominated term deposits and stocks (forecasted transaction); (c) the fair value hedge method using currency options and foreign currency forward contracts is used for hedges against exchange rate fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencydenominated bonds; (d) the deferral hedge method for over-the-counter options on bonds is used for hedges against interest-rate fluctuations in certain foreign currency-denominated bonds; (e) the deferral hedge method and fair value hedge method using equity options and equity forward contracts are used for hedges against price fluctuations in the value of certain domestic stocks and foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction), and (f) the deferral hedge method using interest rate swaps is used for hedges against interest-rate fluctuations in certain insurance liabilities, under the \"Accounting and Auditing Treatment of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments to Insurance Operators\" (Industry Audit Committee Report No.26 issued by JICPA).\n\n## (2) Hedging Instruments and Hedged Items\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nHedged items\n\n| Interest rate swaps                | Loans, government and corporate bonds, loans payable, bonds payable, insurance  liabilities                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Foreign currency swaps             | Foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign  currency-denominated loans payable, foreign currency-denominated bonds payable |\n| Foreign currency forward contracts | Foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated term deposits,  foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction)                   |\n| Currency options                   | Foreign currency-denominated bonds                                                                                                                              |\n| Bond over-the-counter options      | Foreign currency-denominated bonds                                                                                                                              |\n| Equity options                     | Domestic stocks, foreign currency-denominated stocks (forecasted transaction)                                                                                   |\n| Equity forward contracts           | Domestic stocks                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## (3) Hedging Policies\n\nThe Company conducts hedging transactions with regard to certain market risk and foreign currency risk of underlying assets to be hedged, in accordance with the internal investment policy and procedure guidelines.\n\n## (4) Assessment of Hedge Effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed primarily by a comparison of fluctuations in cash flows or fair value of hedged items to those of hedging instruments.\n\n## 14.  Calculation of National and Local Consumption Tax\n\nThe Company accounts for national and local consumption tax by the tax-exclusion method. Deferred consumption tax included in non-recoverable consumption tax on certain assets is capitalized as other assets and amortized equally over five years in accordance with the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act, and such taxes other than deferred consumption tax are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\n## 15.  Policy Reserves\n\nPolicy reserves of the Company are established in accordance with the methods stated in the statement of calculation procedures for policy reserves (Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 4 of the Insurance Business Act) pursuant to Article 116, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act, for insurance contracts under which the insurer's liability has started as of the end of the fiscal year, in preparation for the performance of future obligations under the insurance contracts.\n\nOf policy reserves, insurance premium reserves are calculated by the following methods:\n\n- a)  Reserves for policies subject to the standard policy reserve rules are calculated based on the methods stipulated by the Commissioner of Financial Services Agency (Notification of the Minister of Finance No. 48, 1996).\n- b)  Reserves for other policies are established based on the net level premium method.\n\nIf, through an estimation of future income based on most recent actual figures, the policy reserves set aside are found likely to be insufficient to cover the performance of future obligations, additional policy reserves need to be set aside in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act. Policy reserves include additional policy reserves for some whole life insurance policies in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.\n\nContingency reserves included in policy reserves are set aside in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act to cover risks that may accrue in the future in order to ensure the performance of future obligations under insurance contracts.\n\n## 16.  Policy Acquisition Costs\n\nThe costs of acquiring and renewing policies, which include agent commissions and certain other costs directly related to the acquisition of policies, are expensed when incurred as the Insurance Business Act in Japan does not permit insurance companies to defer and amortize these costs.\n\n## 17.  Financial Instruments and Others\n\n(1) Financial Instruments\n\n## a) Policies in Utilizing Financial Instruments\n\nIn an effort to manage investment assets in a manner appropriate to liabilities, which arise from the insurance policies underwritten, the Company engages in asset liability management, or ALM, which considers the long-term balance between assets and liabilities to ensure stable returns. With this strategy, the Company holds fixed income investments, including bonds and loans, as the core of its asset portfolio. While placing its financial soundness first, the Company also holds stocks and foreign securities within its tolerable risk to enhance its profitability and facilitate diversification of investment risks.\n\nThe Company uses derivatives primarily to hedge market risks associated with its existing asset portfolio and supplement its investment objectives to the extent necessary, taking into account the exposure of underlying assets.\n\nWith respect to financing, the Company has raised capital directly from the capital markets by issuing subordinated bonds as well as indirectly from banks in order to strengthen its capital base. To avoid impact from interest-rate fluctuations, the Company utilizes derivative transactions in hedging some of such financial liabilities and adopts hedge accounting.\n\n## b) Financial Instruments Used and Their Risks\n\nSecurities included in financial assets of the Company, mainly stocks and bonds, are categorized by its investment objectives such as held-to-maturity, policy-reserve-matching securities and available-for-sale securities. Those securities are exposed to market fluctuation risk, credit risk and interest rate risk and some of the securities denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign currency risk. Also, loans are exposed to credit risk arising from the defaults of obligors.\n\nThe Company might be exposed to liquidity risk in certain circumstances in which it cannot make timely payments of principal, interest or other amounts due to unpredictable cash outflows or is forced to raise capital with interest rates substantially higher than usual. Also, some of its loans payable and bonds payable which are floating interest rate based and denominated in foreign currency are exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.\n\nThe Company utilizes i) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain of its loans receivable and payable, ii) equity forward contracts to hedge market fluctuation risks associated with domestic stocks, and iii) foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and foreign currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated short-term deposits and foreign currency-denominated debts, etc. and adopt hedge accounting.\n\nIn addition, the Company utilizes iv) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain insurance",

        "page_content": "liabilities, under the \"Accounting and Auditing Treatment of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments to Insurance Operators\" (JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 26).\n\nIn applying the hedge accounting, in order to fulfill requirements stipulated in the \"Accounting standards for financial instruments\" (ASBJ Statement No. 10 on March 10, 2008), the Company has established investment policy and procedure guidelines and clarified the transactions to be hedged, the risk of underlying assets to be hedged and derivative instruments to be used, and conducted pre- and post-effectiveness tests of the transactions.\n\n## c) Risk Management\n\nThe risk management system of the Company is as follows:\n\n## i) Market Risk Management\n\nUnder the internal investment policy and market risk management policy, the Company manages market risk by conducting mid- to long-term asset allocation in a manner appropriate to its liabilities. Therefore, it categorizes its portfolio into sub-groups, based on their investment purpose, and manages them taking into account each of their risk characteristics.\n\n## (a) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company keeps track of interest rates and durations of its assets and liabilities, monitors its internal analyses on duration gap and interest rate sensitivity, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## (b) Currency risk\n\nThe Company keeps track of currency composition of its financial assets and liabilities, conducts sensitivity analyses, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## (c) Fluctuation in market values\n\nThe Company defines risk management policies and management procedures for each component of its overall portfolio, including securities, based on the risk characteristics of the categories, and set and manages upper limits of each asset balance and asset allocation weight.\n\nSuch management conditions are periodically reported by its risk management sections to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## (d) Derivative transactions\n\nFor derivative transactions, the Company has established internal check system by segregating i) executing department, ii) the department which engages in assessment of hedge effectiveness, and iii) the back-office. Additionally, in order to limit speculative use of derivatives, the Company has put restrictions on utilization purpose, such as hedging, and establishes position limits for each asset class.\n\n## ii) Credit Risk Management\n\nIn accordance with the internal investment policy and credit risk management procedure guidelines, the Company has established a credit management system related to loans, such as preliminary reviews on individual transactions, credit limit setting, credit information management, internal credit rating, attachment of guarantees and collateral, and follow-ups on problem loans. For corporate bond investment, the credit section sets investment caps on individual issuers taking into account internal credit ratings and other factors. Excessive risk-taking is restricted since front offices make investment within those caps. Policies and framework for large-lot borrowers have been formulated in order to prevent credit concentration by monitoring compliance, etc. That credit management has been conducted by the credit and risk management sections, and has been periodically reported to the board of directors, etc. Additionally, the internal audit section has also checked credit management status.\n\nCredit risk of security issuers and counterparty risk with respect to derivative transactions are managed by the credit section, which sets upper limits for each counterparty and financial instrument and periodically monitors credit information, and by the risk management section, which periodically monitors current exposures.\n\n## d) Supplementary Explanation for Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nAs well as the value based on market prices, fair values of financial instruments include values which are reasonably calculated in case market prices do not exist. As the calculation of those values adopts certain assumptions, those values may vary in case different assumptions are applied.\n\n## (2) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet, fair value and differences between carrying amount and fair value as of March 31, 2021 were as follows. The following table does not include financial instruments whose fair value is extremely difficult to recognize.

The fair value of mutual funds is based on unit price.\n\n## (5) Securities\n\nThe fair value of stocks is based on the price on stock exchanges and that of bonds is based on the price on bond markets or price presented by counterparty financial institutions. The fair value of mutual funds is based on unit price. As for ownership stakes in partnerships, the amount equivalent to partnership interest in fair value of the partnership assets is recorded as fair value of the stake in the partnership.",

Therefore, that amount (the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet minus reserve for possible loan losses) is recorded as fair value for risk-monitored loans.\n\nAlso, loans without a due date because of their characteristics that their exposure is limited to the amount of their collaterals, are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account estimated repayment period and interest rates. Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n## (1) Bonds payable\n\nThe fair value of bonds is based on the price on the bond market.\n\n## (2) Payables under repurchase agreements\n\nSince the terms of all payables under repurchase agreements are short and their fair value is close to the carrying amounts, fair value is based on the carrying amount.\n\n## (3) Long-term borrowings\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting future cash flows, using interest rates corresponding to internal credit rating and remaining periods which are assumed to be applied to new borrowings.\n\n## Derivative Transactions\n\nThe breakdown of derivative transactions is (1) currency-related transactions; (2) interest-related transactions; (3) stock-related transactions; and (4) bond-related transactions, etc. The fair value of the instruments is based on the closing exchange-traded prices and the prices quoted from financial institutions, etc.\n\n(Note 2) Financial instruments whose fair value is extremely difficult to recognize were as follows and are not included in the fair value of (5) Securities in (Note 1)\n\n| As of March 31, 2021                 | Carrying amount     | Carrying amount            |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                      | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million US dollars) |\n| 1.

Each property for rent and property not in use, which is not used for insurance business purposes, is deemed to be an independent asset group.\n\n## (2) Background for Recognition of Impairment Losses\n\nAs a result of significant declines in profitability or market value of some asset groups, the Company wrote down the book value of these assets to the recoverable value, and reported such write-off as impairment losses in extraordinary losses.\n\n## (3) Breakdown of Impairment Losses\n\nImpairment losses by asset group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n| Asset Group            | Place                                        | Number              | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                        |                                              |                     | Land                | Buildings           | Total               | Land                       | Buildings                  | Total                      |\n|                        |                                              | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) |\n| Real estate for rent   | Morioka city, Iwate Prefecture               | 1                   | 25                  | 31                  | 57                  | 0                          | 0                          | 0                          |\n| Real estate not in use | Takamatsu city, Kagawa Prefecture and others | 22                  | 1,741               | 752                 | 2,494               | 15                         | 6                          | 22                         |\n| Total                  | -                                            | 23                  | 1,767               | 784                 | 2,552               | 15                         | 7                          | 23                         |\n\n## (4) Calculation of Recoverable Value\n\nValue in use or net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate for rent, and net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate not in use. A discount rate of 2.17% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was applied for discounting future cash flows in the calculation of value in use. Estimated disposal value, appraisal value based on real estate appraisal standards, or appraisal value based on publicly assessed land value for tax purposes is used as the net sale value.",

It seems just like yesterday that we were deeply discussing what sort of language we should use in this integrated report in order to convey in best way our view behind that resolve and the thought process involved.\n\nAs a result, we made the bold choice not to include the usual introduction part about our history (which even included the photo of our founder Tsuneta Yano), and instead attempted to share our two-page view on the upcoming future. We hope this left a positive impression on you.\n\nIn addition, we also were concerned about  the extent up to which we, as a holding company, should cover the incident of fraudulent cash mishandlings that took place at one of our operating companies. And whether our approach content creation in a business issue-oriented manner rather than an achievement-oriented manner was the right call. With encouraging words from our President Inagaki, who is promoting greater transparency among management, we attempted such approach.\n\nAnd despite finishing final proofreading of this report, areas of improvement such as certain thoughts not being organized and lack of reader's perspective in some parts have already been uncovered. Some features even covered initiatives that did not lead to concrete plans. For our next report, we sincerely hope to benefit from your feedbacks. Please share your candid opinions and suggestions.\n\nFinally, allow me to thank you for your ongoing support for Dai-ichi Life Group.\n\nAtsushi Nakamura Head of IR Group Corporate Planning Unit\n\n## Positioning of This Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to provide understanding of the Dai-ichi Life Group by all stakeholders, material information in this report is summarized.
