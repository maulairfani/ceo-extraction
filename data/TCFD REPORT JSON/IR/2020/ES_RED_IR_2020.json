(the 'Parent') and subsidiaries (together the 'Group') which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and consolidated notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated annual accounts give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31 December 2020 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain.\n\nBasis for Opinion \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Accounts section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated annual accounts pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any non-audit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated annual accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated annual accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n2\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\n## Additions to property, plant and equipment (Euros 388,261 thousand) See note 8 to the consolidated annual accounts\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nMost of the Group's property, plant and equipment pertain to Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., the regulated activity of which mainly consists of managing the transmission network of the Spanish electricity system. Each year, Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. makes substantial investments in property, plant and equipment in accordance with the Electricity Transmission Network Development Plan for 2015 - 2020 approved by agreement of the Council of Ministers on 16 October 2015. In 2020 additions to the Group's property, plant and equipment totalled Euros 488,398 thousand, of which Euros 388,261 thousand pertains to the investee Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U.\n\nConsidering the nature of the business carried out by this investee, the remuneration for these services is set by the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) through Circular 5/2019, which determines the method for calculating the remuneration of the transmission activity based on the costs necessary to construct, operate and maintain the technical electricity facilities, pursuant to the powers bestowed upon this Commission by Royal Decree-Law 1/2019. As the Parent's transmission revenues are directly related to the recognised electricity transmission facilities, and bearing in mind the significance of these facilities, we have considered the additions to property, plant and equipment to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the relevant controls associated with processes involving fixed assets and acquisitions, as well as performing substantive procedures on property, plant and equipment. We also assessed the consistency of the Group's accounting policies on fixed assets and acquisitions with the applicable accounting framework.\n\nOur procedures for evaluating and analysing the control environment were focused on:\n\n- -Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key manual and automated controls related to the cycles of 'additions and disposals of fixed assets' and 'acquisition of assets and services, progress billings for construction'.\n\nOur substantive procedures on property, plant and equipment mainly consisted of:\n\n- -Analysing additions during the year and assessing the accuracy of their accounting recognition.\n- -Analysing documentation supporting the cost allocation for a sample of projects in progress.\n\nWe also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts meet the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.\n\n## Business combination and acquisition of a joint venture (Euros 933,000 thousand and Euros 374,300 thousand)\n\nSee notes 6 and 11 to the consolidated annual accounts\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nIn 2019, the Group acquired a telecommunications business in Spain from an unrelated third party for Euros 933,000 thousand.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following: -performing audit procedures on the balance",

In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\n## Business combination and acquisition of a joint venture (Euros 933,000 thousand and Euros 374,300 thousand)\n\nSee notes 6 and 11 to the consolidated annual accounts\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nFurthermore, in 2020, the Group acquired an electricity transmission joint venture in Brazil for Euros 374,300 thousand, which has been accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts using the equity method.\n\nThe accounting of these transactions was complex and required the application of judgements in identifying and determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. The valuations used for this purpose were performed by an expert engaged by the Group, using the discounted cash flow method.\n\nIn 2019, due to the complexity in determining the fair value of certain assets of the business combination involving the telecommunications business, the Group carried out a provisional purchase price allocation (PPA), making the final allocation in 2020. As a result of the definitive determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the telecommunications business, differences arose with respect to the provisional initial values at which they had been recognised in the consolidated annual accounts for 2019. The adjustments recognised to complete the initial accounting were made retrospectively by restating the figures for 2019, in accordance with prevailing legislation.\n\nWe consider that these transactions are a key audit matter due to their significance, and the inherent judgement and complexity involved in making fair value estimates.\n\nsheets of the acquired companies at their acquisition date;\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- determining the acquisition date and the consideration paid, taking into account the specific conditions of the purchase agreement in each case;\n- obtaining, reading and analysing the valuation report on the acquired assets and liabilities of the joint venture, drawn up by an independent expert engaged by the Group;\n- obtaining, reading and analysing the final valuation report on the acquired assets and liabilities of the telecommunications business, drawn up by an independent expert engaged by the Group;\n- evaluating the independence and professional competence of the independent experts;\n- -assessing the methodology and key assumptions used to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and their identification, involving our valuation specialists for this purpose and corroborating the Group's explanations with market data and our own knowledge.\n\nIn addition, we identified the assets and liabilities of the joint venture whose valuation was determined provisionally, evaluating the reasons for the provisional nature of the estimates and assessing whether the investment was accounted for appropriately on initial recognition. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts regarding these two operations meet the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.\n\nRecoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets\n\nSee notes 7, 8, 11 and 19 to the consolidated annual accounts\n\nKey audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\n## Recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets See notes 7, 8, 11 and 19 to the consolidated annual accounts\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nAs mentioned in notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated annual accounts, at 31 December 2020, the Group's property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill amount to Euros 9,511 million, Euros 460 million and Euros 231 million, respectively, allocated to the various cashgenerating units (CGUs) or, in the case of Hispasat, S.A. goodwill, to groups of CGUs.\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in notes 11 and 19 to the consolidated annual accounts, the Group holds an investment in Transmisora El\u00e9ctrica del Norte, S.A., an equity-accounted investee, amounting to Euros 174 million, and a loan of Euros 17 million extended to the latter, both of which the Group tested for impairment after identifying indications thereof.\n\nThere is a risk that the carrying amount of the CGUs may exceed their recoverable amount in the case of CGUs or groups of CGUs that show indications of impairment. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually and tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for indications of impairment, for the purposes of determining their recoverable amount. These recoverable amounts are calculated considering their value in use or fair value less costs to sell, applying valuation techniques which require the exercising of judgement by the Directors and management and the use of estimates. Due to the high level of judgement, the uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the significance of the carrying amount of the non-current assets subject to impairment testing and of the impairment recognised by the Group, this has been considered a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- -assessing the design and implementation of key controls related to the process for assessing the criteria used to identify indications of impairment, and for estimating the recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets;\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- evaluating the methodology and reasonableness of the assumptions used by management and the Directors to estimate the recoverable amount using the discounted cash flow method at cashgenerating unit level, as well as the recoverable amount of the investment in and the loan extended to Transmisora El\u00e9ctrica del Norte, S.A., calculated by discounting this entity's cash flows, with the involvement of our valuation specialists and based on the reports drawn up by the independent experts engaged by the Group to contrast the reasonableness of the assumptions used;\n- contrasting the information contained in the model used to calculate the recoverable amount with the business plans of the companies;\n- analysing the sensitivity of the estimated recoverable amount to changes in the relevant assumptions and judgements.\n- We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts meet the requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.",

Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated directors' report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows:\n\n- a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement and certain information included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, as specified in the Spanish Audit Law, have been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter.\n- b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated directors' report with the consolidated annual accounts, based on knowledge of the Group obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated annual accounts. Also, assess and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated directors' report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them.\n\nBased on the work carried out, as described above, we have observed that the information mentioned in section a) above has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated directors' report is consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts for 2020, and that the content and presentation of the report are in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements set forth in article 540 of the Revised Spanish Companies Act and Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) Circular 5/2013 of 12 June 2013, subsequently amended by CNMV Circular 7/2015 of 22 December 2015 and by CNMV Circular 2/2018 of 12 June 2018 and which provides the models for the Annual Corporate Governance Report for listed corporations, and for the purposes of the description of Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Annual Corporate Governance Reports, and as mentioned in section F.7.1 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report, which forms part of the accompanying consolidated directors' report for 2020, on 23 February 2021, at the Parent's request, we issued our Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group for 2020, based on our examination, which was performed in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) (International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) for the issue of reasonable assurance reports.\n\n6\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's Directors.",

(hereinafter the Parent or the Company) is the Parent of a Group formed by subsidiaries. The Group is also involved in joint operations along with other operators. The Parent and its subsidiaries form the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group (hereinafter the Group or Red El\u00e9ctrica Group). The Company's registered office is located in Alcobendas (Madrid) and its shares are traded on the Spanish automated quotation system as part of the selective IBEX 35 index.\n\nThe Group's principal activity is electricity transmission, system operation and management of the transmission network for the Spanish electricity system. These regulated activities are carried out through Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. (hereinafter REE).\n\nThe Group also conducts electricity transmission activities outside Spain through Red El\u00e9ctrica Internacional, S.A.U. (hereinafter REI) and its investees. Furthermore, the Group provides\n\n## 2 Basis of Presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts\n\n## a) General information\n\nThe accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared by the directors of the Parent to give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2020, as well as the consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows and changes in consolidated equity for the year then ended.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated annual accounts, authorised for issue by the Company's directors at their board meeting held on 23 February 2021, have been prepared on the basis of the individual accounting records of the Company and the other Group companies, which together form the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group (see Appendix I). Each company prepares its annual accounts applying the accounting principles and criteria in force in its country of operations. Accordingly, the adjustments and reclassifications necessary to harmonise these principles and criteria with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) have been made on consolidation.\n\n-\n\nCONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\ntelecommunications services to third parties through Red El\u00e9ctrica Infraestructuras de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, S.A.U. (hereinafter REINTEL), essentially via dark fibre backbone network rental, and through the HISPASAT subgroup (hereinafter HISPASAT), by means of satellite infrastructure operation.\n\nIn addition, the Group carries out activities through its subsidiaries aimed at financing its operations and covering risks by reinsuring its assets and activities. It also develops and builds electricity infrastructure and facilities through its subsidiaries and/or investees, Red El\u00e9ctrica Infraestructuras en Canarias, S.A.U. (REINCAN) and Interconexi\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Francia-Espa\u00f1a, S.A.S. (INELFE).

The consolidated annual accounts for 2020 are currently pending approval by the shareholders. However, the directors of the Company consider that these consolidated annual accounts will be approved with no changes.\n\nThese consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except in the case of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss and business combinations.\n\nThe figures disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts are expressed in thousands of Euros, the Parent's functional and presentation currency,\n\nrounded off to the nearest thousand. The consolidated annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU, and other applicable provisions in the financial reporting framework.\n\nThe Group has not omitted any mandatory accounting principle with a significant effect on the consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## b) New IFRS-EU and IFRIC\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU.\n\nThe following standards and amendments have been applied for the first time in 2020:\n\nThe new amendments issued are as follows:\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nThese amendments clarify the definition of 'material', which, in addition to omissions and misstatements that could influence decisions made by users of the information, now also includes the concept of 'obscure'. As a result of these amendments, the IFRS are more consistent with the definition of 'material' laid down in the conceptual framework. This amendment has not had a significant impact on the preparation of the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## New requirements or amendments approved for use in the EU\n\n## E F F E C T I V E   F R O M :   1   J A N U A R Y   2 0 2 0\n\nAmendments regarding reference to the Conceptual Framework under IFRS\n\nIAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nIFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR)\n\nIFRS 3 - Definition of a Business\n\n## E F F E C T I V E   F R O M :   1   J U N E   2 0 2 0\n\nIFRS 16 - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\n<!-- image -->",

The exceptions pertain to hedge accounting and the outcome is that the IBOR reform should not generally give rise to the discontinuation of hedge accounting. However, any hedge ineffectiveness must continue to be recognised in the income statement.\n\nWith regard to the IBOR reform, the Group has various hedging relationships to hedge interest rate risk, using derivatives and underlyings whose benchmark rate is generally the EURIBOR. No hedging relationships have been affected, and moreover, the Group is only minimally exposed to intraday benchmark interest rates (EONIA). With respect to the EURIBOR, in 2019 a new hybrid calculation methodology was developed based on actual market transactions, which distinguishes between three levels of estimates, depending on the extent to which such transactions are observable. This new methodology was approved by the authorities, and therefore no amendments to existing or future contracts are expected to be required, on considering that these financial instruments are not exposed to a high level of uncertainty at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe remaining benchmark interest rates are undergoing a reform on a global scale, although this is not expected to affect the long-term hedging relationships currently in place. The Group has adopted a proactive stance with respect to this process, carrying out its monitoring and analysis sufficiently in advance to prevent any negative impacts that may arise. On this basis, the changes in benchmark interest rates have not had a significant impact on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business\n\nThese amendments will help to determine whether a transaction is a business combination or an acquisition of a set of assets. The amended definition emphasises that the output of a business consists of goods and services provided to customers, whereas in the previous definition the focus was on providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners. Besides changing the wording of the definition, additional guidance is now given. To be considered a business, an acquisition must include an input and a process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The new guidance provides a framework for assessing whether both elements are present (even in the case of early-stage entities that have not yet started to generate outputs). An entity that has not started generating revenue must now have an\n\norganised workforce in order to be considered as a business.\n\nThese amendments apply to business combinations and asset acquisitions carried out on or after 1 January 2020. These amendments have not had an impact on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## IFRS 16 Leases - Rent concessions\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 16 Leases introduces an optional practical expedient that lessees may apply when determining whether a Covid-19related rent concession is a lease modification. This amendment is effective for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. This amendment has not had an impact on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## New requirements or amendments effective as of 1 January 2021\n\nThe new standards not yet adopted by the European Union for which application is not mandatory in 2020 but which will enter into force for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 are as follows:",

Estimates and judgements are assessed continually and are based on past experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered reasonable given the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts for 2020 occasionally include estimates calculated by management of the Group and of the consolidated companies, and subsequently endorsed by their directors, to quantify certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses and commitments disclosed therein.\n\nThese estimates are essentially as follows:\n\n- > Estimated asset recovery, calculated by determining the recoverable amount thereof. The recoverable amount is understood to be the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Asset impairment is generally calculated using discounted cash flows based on financial projections used by the Group.\n\nThe discount rate applied is the weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the country risk premium (see note 8).\n\n- > Estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment (see note 4.b).\n- > The assumptions used in the actuarial calculations of liabilities and obligations to employees (see note 16).\n- > The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of derivatives (see note 20).\n- > Estimated revenue from electricity transmission facilities in Spain for periods prior to n+2 (see note 13).\n- > The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination (see note 6). The Company has taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of possible claims that might be lodged by third parties in relation to its activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group assesses and estimates amounts to be settled in the future, including additional amounts for income tax, contractual obligations, pending lawsuit settlements and other liabilities. These estimates are subject to the interpretation of existing facts and circumstances, projected future events and the estimated financial effect of those events (see note 16). The Company has taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of possible claims that might be lodged by third parties in relation to its activities.\n\nIn the absence of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) that give guidance on the accounting treatment for a particular situation, in accordance with IAS 8, management uses its best judgement based on the economic substance of the transaction and considering the most recent pronouncements of other standardsetting bodies that use the same conceptual framework as IFRS. Accordingly, as tax credits for investments are not within the scope of IAS 12 and IAS 20, after analysing the related facts and circumstances, Group management has considered that credits for investments granted\n\n-\n\nto the Group by public entities are similar to capital grants. Therefore, in these cases management has taken into account IAS 20 on government grants (see note 4j).\n\nTo facilitate comprehension of the consolidated annual accounts, details of the different estimates and assumptions are provided in each separate note.\n\nAlthough estimates are based on the best information available at 31 December 2020, future events may require increases or decreases in these estimates in subsequent years, which would be accounted for prospectively in the corresponding consolidated income statement as a change in accounting estimates, as required by IFRS.\n\n## d) Consolidation principles\n\nThe types of companies included in the consolidated Group and the consolidation method used in each case are as follows:\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, over which the Company, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, exercises control. The Company controls a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. The Company has power over a subsidiary when it has existing substantive rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities. The Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary when its returns from its involvement have the potential to vary as a result of the subsidiary's performance.\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nThe income, expenses and cash flows of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual accounts from the date of acquisition, which is when the Group takes control, until the date that control ceases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nevertheless, unrealised losses have been considered as an indicator of impairment of the assets transferred.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are those in which there is a contractual agreement to share the control over an economic activity, in such a way that decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group and the remaining venturers or operators. The existence of joint control is assessed considering the definition of control over subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group assesses all the facts and circumstances relating to each joint arrangement for the purpose of its classification as a joint venture or joint operation, including whether the arrangement contains rights over the assets and obligations for liabilities.\n\nIn joint operations there is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. For joint operations, the Group recognises the assets, including its share of any assets held jointly, the liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly with the other operators, the revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation, and the expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly, in the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nJoint ventures are those in which there is a contractual agreement with a third party to share control over an activity and the strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of all the venturers that share control. The Group's interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nThe Group's acquisition of an initial and subsequent share in a joint operation that is a business is recognised following the same criteria used for business combinations, at the percentage of ownership of each individual asset and liability. However, in subsequent acquisitions of additional shares in a joint operation, the previous share in each asset and liability is not subject to revaluation.\n\nIn sales or contributions by the Group to the joint operation, it recognises the resulting gains and losses only to the extent of the other parties' interests in the joint operation. When such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in net realisable value or an impairment loss of the assets transferred, such losses are recognised in full.\n\nIn purchases by the Group from a joint operation, it only recognises the resulting gains and losses when it resells the acquired assets to a third party. However, when such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in net realisable value or an impairment loss of the assets, the Group recognises its entire share of such losses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. The existence of potential voting rights that are exercisable or convertible at the end of each reporting period, including potential voting rights held by the Group or other entities, are considered when assessing whether an entity has significant influence.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. However, if on the acquisition date all or part of the investment qualifies for recognition as non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale, it is recognised at fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nInvestments in associates are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, including any cost directly attributable to the acquisition\n\nand any consideration receivable or payable contingent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions. Any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the associate's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date is recognised as goodwill under equity-accounted investees in the consolidated statement of financial position. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the associate's identifiable net assets over the cost of the investment at the acquisition date (bargain purchase) is recognised as income in the period in which the investment is acquired.\n\nThe Group classifies the profit or loss of these companies in results from operating activities when the entity's activity is similar to the Group's operating activities. Conversely, when their activity is different, the profit or loss of these companies is classified outside results from operating activities.\n\nAppendix I provides details of the Company's subsidiaries, joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates, as well as the consolidation or measurement method used in preparing the accompanying consolidated annual accounts and other relevant information.\n\nThe financial statements of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates used in the consolidation process have the same reporting date and refer to the same period as those of the Parent.\n\nThe operations of the Company and its subsidiaries have been consolidated applying the following basic principles:\n\n- > The accounting principles and criteria used by the Group companies have been harmonised with those applied by the Parent.\n- > Translation of foreign operations:\n- \u2202   Balances in the financial statements of foreign companies have been translated using the closing exchange rate for assets and liabilities, the average exchange rate for income and expenses and the historical exchange rate for capital and reserves.\n- \u2202  All resulting exchange differences are recognised as translation differences in other comprehensive income.\n- \u2202  These criteria are also applicable to the translation of the financial statements of equity-accounted investees, with translation differences attributable to the Group recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Noncontrolling interests' share in consolidated profit or loss for the year and in consolidated comprehensive income for the year is disclosed separately.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are recognised as transactions with equity holders of the Group. As such, the difference between the consideration paid in the acquisition of a non-controlling interest and the corresponding proportion of the carrying amount of the subsidiary's net assets is recognised in equity. Similarly, the gains or losses on disposal of non-controlling interests are also recognised in the Group's equity.\n\n## f) Comparative information\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows in these consolidated annual accounts include comparative figures for the prior year, which differ from those presented in the approved consolidated annual accounts for 2019 due to figures being restated for the following reasons:\n\n- > Completion of the purchase price allocation relating to the acquisition of HISPASAT on 3 October 2019 (see note 6).\n- > Change in accounting criteria with respect to the recognition of non-controlling interests in the HISPASAT business combination (see note 6). At 31 December 2019 the Group had recognised these interests at fair value, whereas at 31 December 2020 non-controlling interests have been recognised in the amount of the proportionate share of the net assets.\n- > In addition, the Group has classified the profit/loss for the period of the equityaccounted investee Hisdesat Servicios Estrat\u00e9gicos, S.A. (hereinafter Hisdesat) under results from operating activities, in accordance with Decision EECS/0114-06 'Change of Presentation of the Share in the Profit or Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures Accounted for Using the Equity Method' issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This company is wholly owned by Red El\u00e9ctrica Internacional, S.A.U.\n\n- > On 25 March 2020, once the conditions precedent laid down in the purchase agreement had been met, a 50% interest was acquired in the Brazilian company 'Energia Empreendimentos e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A.' and\n\nsubsidiaries (hereinafter ARGO Energia). This company's statutory activity mainly consists of the acquisition, holding, management and administration of securities. This company is the parent of a group of electricity transmission concession operator companies in Brazil. REB holds a 50% interest in this company. It is accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe changes in the consolidated Group in 2019 were as follows:\n\n- > Red El\u00e9ctrica del Norte Per\u00fa, S.A.C. (REDELNOR) was incorporated on 11 January 2019 and is wholly owned by REI.

This Law prompted the start of a vertical disintegration of the different activities, whereby activities carried out under a natural monopoly regime (transmission and distribution) were segregated from those operating on a free competition basis (generation and supply). A series of reforms was embarked upon in 2013, which culminated in the enactment of the current Electricity Industry Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013. These reforms and the new Law were introduced principally to address the imbalance between revenues and costs of the electricity system in previous years, which in turn resulted from certain energy and tariff policy decisions and was aggravated by the impact of the financial crisis on electricity demand. The Law lays down the following regulatory framework with respect to the activities conducted by the Company:\n\n- > The Law acknowledges the natural monopoly in the transmission activity, arising from the economic efficiency afforded by a sole grid. Transmission is liberalised by granting widespread third-party access to the network,\n\nwhich is made available to the different electricity system agents and consumers in exchange for payment of an access charge.\n\nThe remuneration for this activity is set by the government based on the general principles defined in the Law and, until 2019, on the method set forth in Royal Decree 1047/2013 of 27 December 2013, which sets out the methodology for calculating the remuneration for electricity transmission activities. However, due to the change in remit introduced through Royal Decree-Law 1/2019, on urgent measures to adapt the powers of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) to the requirements of Community law in respect of Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/ EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009, concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas, respectively, for the new regulatory period commencing in 2020 the CNMC has approved a new methodology, set forth in Circular 5/2019 of 5 December 2019, which defines the methodology for calculating the remuneration for electricity transmission activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Circular 2/2019 defines the methodology for calculating the financial rate of return for electricity transmission and distribution, regasification, and natural gas transmission and distribution, and Circular 7/2019 approves the standard facilities and reference unit values for operation and maintenance per asset that are to be used in calculating the remuneration allocable to companies that own electricity transmission facilities. This Circular also provided that the reference unit values for investment that were in force in the previous regulatory period, which were established by Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism Order IET/2659/2015, were to be extended to cover the 2020-2025 period.\n\nRegulated revenue for the transmission activity for the first year of application of Royal Decree 1047/2013 (i.e. 2016) was determined definitively in Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism Order IET/981/2016. Subsequently, between 2017 and 2020, the regulated revenue for this activity was determined on a provisional basis and settled on account. The regulators (the Ministry until 2019 and the CNMC for revenue pertaining to 2020) provisionally opted to repeat what was stipulated for 2016 in terms of the amount of remuneration, and this has therefore remained constant. This provisional\n\n-\n\napproach (for the 2017-2020 period) stems from the 'detriment proceedings' brought by the Spanish State Attorney against the aforementioned Ministerial Order IET/981/2016, seeking that the Spanish Supreme Court declare certain articles therein null and void, thus enabling the definitive revenue for 2016 to be corrected. The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 29 June 2020, ruling in part for the State, and thus requiring Ministerial Order IET/981/2016 and the revenue for 2016 to be corrected. This is expected to occur in 2021, and will thus allow for the definitive transmission activity revenue for 2017-2020 to be established.\n\n- > As electricity system operator, the Company's main function is to guarantee the continuity and security of the electricity supply, as well as to ensure the correct coordination of the production and transmission system, exercising its duties in cooperation with the operators and agents of the Spanish electricity market (MIBEL) while observing the principles of transparency, objectivity and independence. Law 24/2013 also bestows upon the system operator the role of transmission network manager.\n\nAs provided in article 31.1 of the aforementioned law, the Ministry shall assign the role of transmission network manager for the Spanish electricity system to Red El\u00e9ctrica following certification by the CNMC, and the European Commission shall be notified in order for such assignment to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. In 2015 the certification process for Red El\u00e9ctrica as transmission network manager for the Spanish electricity system, as envisaged in the law, was completed following publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of 12 February 2015 of the Notification of the Spanish Government regarding the designation of Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. as transmission system operator in Spain. Under this assignment, Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. operates on an ownership unbundling basis as stipulated in article 9 of the old Directive 2009/72/EC, and reiterated in article 43 of the new Directive 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity.\n\nThe Company is also responsible for the functions of settlement, notification of payments and receipts, and management of guarantees relating to security of supply and the effective diversion of units generated and consumed, as well as for short-term energy exchanges aimed at maintaining the quality and security of supply.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CNMC also established the first ever remuneration model for the system operation activity, through Circular 4/2019, which defines the remuneration methodology for the electricity system operator. The core principle of this remuneration model is that of providing suitable remuneration for a low-risk activity, considering those costs prudently incurred by an efficient and well-managed company. The CNMC has applied the remuneration methodology laid down in Circular 4/2019 to determine the remuneration of the system operator for 2020 and 2021. With the publication of the new\n\nremuneration methodology, the regulator should now proceed to estimate the definitive remuneration for 2014-2019, which previously was estimated on a provisional basis in the absence of a calculation methodology.\n\nRegarding the Company's remit in the nonmainland electricity systems, in 2015 the ChiraSoria 200 MW reversible hydroelectric power plant project in Gran Canaria was transferred to the system operator, as stipulated in Order IET/728/2014 of 28 April 2014. Having taken ownership, in 2016 Red El\u00e9ctrica submitted a project amending the initial project, which included technical and environmental improvements aimed at increasing the capacity for integrating renewable energy and reducing the impact of this new infrastructure on the environment. In 2016 the Canary Islands government declared the new project to be of strategic interest and it has been subject to administrative consideration since then, before construction gets underway.\n\n## b) International electricity sector\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has built and acquired electricity transmission facilities through REI. At international level, it now operates and maintains these facilities in Peru, Chile and Brazil. Various electricity transmission facilities were also under construction by subsidiaries of REI in these countries at the end of 2020.\n\n## Electricity sector in Peru\n\nIn Peru, the liberalisation of the electricity sector began in 1992 with the publication of the 'Electricity Concessions Law' (LCE). The shaping of the electricity sector was subsequently completed by the 2006 reform (Law 28832, 'Law for the Efficient Development of Electricity Generation', LGE).\n\nThese two laws and certain amendments and/or extensions, together with the Regulation implementing the Electricity Concessions Law (Supreme Decree No. 009-93-EM enacted in 1993), make up the basic regulatory framework for the electricity sector in Peru.\n\nThe basic regulatory framework for the transmission activity also includes the 'Transmission Regulation' (Supreme Decree No. 027-2007-EM). Certain major regulatory developments instituted by the regulatory agency OSINERGMIN should also be highlighted, such as the Resolutions approving the annual settlement procedure for electricity transmission service revenue (Resolutions No. 055-2020-OS/CD and No. 056-2020-OS/CD), as well as Resolution No. 217-2013-OS/CD, regulating 'Tariffs and Remuneration for Secondary Transmission Systems (STS) and Complementary Transmission Systems (CTS)'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The auction procedure required an energy planning process to be developed, which did not exist prior to the publication of the LGE.\n\nThe Peruvian regulatory framework is currently open to discussion. On 20 June 2019 Supreme Resolution No. 006-2019-EM was published, which created the CRSE (multi-sector power reform commission), for the purpose of reviewing and adjusting the existing legal and regulatory framework in order to optimise the efficient development of the Peruvian electricity market while adhering to international standards and best practice, seeking to guarantee the sustainability of the electricity subsector.\n\n- > A technical document is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2022 which will contain institutional legislative proposals and regulatory reforms to foster modernisation and address the challenges arising in the electricity industry, so as to ensure sufficient generation, the incorporation of renewable energies, smart metering, distributed generation, empowerment of demand, and harmonised development across the electricity and natural gas sectors.\n- > The following topics will be addressed in the specific case of the transmission subsector:\n\n-\n\n- (i) flexibility in the expansion of the transmission system; (ii) efficacy and transparency in transmission network access; (iii) simplification of remuneration schemes; and (iv) international interconnections.\n\n## Electricity sector in Chile\n\nThe legal framework governing the electricity transmission business in Chile is contained in Decree with Force of Law (DFL) No. 4/2006, which sets out the revised, coordinated and systematised text of Ministry of Mining Decree with Force of Law (DFL) No. 1 of 1982, the General Electricity Services Law (DFL No. 1/1982) and subsequent amendments thereto. Such amendments include Law 19,940 (Short Law I) enacted on 13 March 2004, Law 20,018 (Short Law II) enacted on 19 May 2005, and Law 20,257 (Generation through Non-conventional Renewable Energy Sources) enacted on 1 April 2008. These regulations are supplemented by the Regulation of the General Electricity Services Law of 1997 (Ministry of Mining Supreme Decree No. 327 of 1997) and respective amendments thereto, and by the Technical Standard for Safety and Quality of Service (Exempt Ministerial Resolution No. 40 of 16 May 2005) and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\nThe new Transmission Law was enacted on 11 July 2016. This law provides for a new independent coordinating body for the National Electricity System, known as the National\n\nElectricity Coordinator ('CEN'), which combines the former Economic Load Dispatch Centre Central Interconnected System ('CDEC SIC') and the Economic Load Dispatch Centre - Far North Interconnection System ('CDEC SING'). It also defines a new electricity transmission system wherein the facilities forming part of the Backbone, Sub-transmission and Additional Transmission Systems were amalgamated into the National, Zonal and Dedicated Transmission Systems, respectively. The remuneration received by the transmission agent is calculated by applying a variable post-tax discount rate that ranges between a minimum of 7% and a maximum of 10%. The new law was effective immediately and application thereof is gradual, culminating in full application from 2020 onwards.\n\nLastly, the most noteworthy developments in the last year include the publication, on 13 June, of the Regulation on the Designation, Valuation, Pricing and Remuneration of Transmission Facilities, approved by the Ministry of Energy's Supreme Decree No. 10 of 1 February 2020. This Regulation governs relevant processes for the transmission segment, such as the designation, valuation, pricing and remuneration of electricity transmission system facilities, in addition to other aspects necessary for the adequate performance of such processes. Under the current framework, the annual value of national and zonal transmission facilities and development hubs in the transmission system is determined\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, revenue for the new tariff period (2020-2023) has not been conclusively determined, inasmuch as the value of the assets not put out for tender is under review.\n\n## Electricity sector in Brazil\n\nThe transmission model in Brazil is based on government concessions, for which the core principles of public service are enshrined in the Constitution of 1988, and the principles that govern concessions in Law 8,987 and Law 9,974 of 1995, respectively.\n\nThis framework provides that concession agreements are administrative contracts entered into with the federal government (national), represented by the regulatory agency ANEEL, which cannot be amended or early terminated by the government, except for duly supported reasons deemed to be in the public interest (very similar to the Spanish model).\n\nUnder this model, concessions for backbone network facilities are put out for tender by ANEEL through auctions. The auctions determine which transmission companies will build, maintain and operate the electricity assets during the concession period. By way of remuneration\n\nfor the service rendered during this period, transmission companies receive the revenue specified in the auction, i.e. the Receita Anual Permitida (Annual Permitted Remuneration - RAP as per the Portuguese acronym).\n\nIn terms of sector regulations, there are no laws that govern the transmission activity in general; rather, specific aspects are regulated (e.g. extension of concession terms under Law 12,783 of 2013). There are also ministerial and government orders, and specific rules are included in the concession agreements themselves.\n\n## c) Telecommunications\n\n## Telecommunications in Spain\n\nThe telecommunications sector in Spain is regulated by General Telecommunications Law 9/2014 of 9 May 2014 (GTL), which mainly seeks to foster competition in the market and guarantee access to the networks, and by Royal Decree 330/2016 of 9 September 2016, on measures to reduce the actual cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks.\n\nAforementioned Law 9/2014 is developed by Royal Decree 123/2017 of 24 February 2017 approving the regulation on the use of public domain radio, which in turn also regulates the award of the right to use the orbit and spectrum resource and the permits for the satellite ground\n\nsegment and the related spectrum. Accordingly, REINTEL and HISPASAT have been entered on the Register of Electronic Communications Operators of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC). HISPASAT, meanwhile, has been awarded the permits for the ground segment and the concessions to use the related radio spectrum, as well as concessions to operate various orbit and spectrum resources.\n\nThe European regulatory framework comprises Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (Recast), Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 (regarding users' rights), and Directive 2009/140/EC (regulatory improvements). Based on this legislation, the General Telecommunications Law introduces measures aimed at creating an appropriate framework for investing in the deployment of new generation networks, thereby enabling operators to offer innovative services that are more technologically adapted to people's needs.\n\nIn line with the foregoing, special note should also be taken of Directive 2014/61/EU on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks, which mainly seeks to expedite implementation\n\n<!-- image -->",

This directive was transposed into Spanish law by Royal Decree 330/2016, on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks. The legislation (Directive 2014/61/ EU and Royal Decree 330/2016) stipulates that access to infrastructure that may be used to host public electronic communications networks must be guaranteed for operators of public electronic communications networks. In this respect, the legislation requires owners and managers of infrastructure that may be used to host public high-speed electronic communications networks as well as parties to whom rights-ofuse for such infrastructure have been granted (including network operators that provide physical infrastructure for the purpose of rendering electricity transmission services) to address all requests to access such infrastructure applying fair and reasonable terms and conditions. This obligation is fulfilled in view of the nature of the dark fibre business.\n\n## Telecommunications in Latin America\n\nThe Group provides services in different Latin American countries. In most Latin American countries, an entitlement must be obtained\n\nin order to provide satellite capacity to telecommunications service providers. Such entitlement may be in the form of permits, concessions, entry in a register or inclusion on a list of authorised satellites. The satellites in the fleet are duly authorised in all countries where this is required, except where there is no commercial interest or no satellite coverage.\n\nIn Brazil, the Group holds rights to operate various orbit and spectrum resources, as well as a multimedia communications permit that entitles it to provide electronic communications services. The applicable legislation in this case is Resolution no. 220 of 5 April 2000 approving the Regulation on Satellite Operation Rights for the Transmission of Telecommunication Signals, Resolution no. 614 of 28 May 2013 approving the Multimedia Communications Service Regulation, and General Telecommunications Law no. 9,472 of 16 July 1997.\n\nIn Mexico the Group is authorised to provide wholesale satellite internet services and satellite cellular backhaul services. To this end, it holds the sole concession for commercial use, in accordance with the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law of 14 July 2014.\n\nIn Colombia it renders satellite telecommunications services, for which it has been granted authorisation by the ICT Single Register of providers of telecommunications\n\nnetworks and services. The applicable legislation is essentially Law 1978 of 2019 on the modernisation of ICT, and Law 1341 of 2009 defining principles and concepts relating to the information society and the organisation of information and communication technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe accounting principles used in preparing the accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been applied consistently to the reported periods presented and are as follows:\n\n## a) Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The acquisition date is the date on which the Group obtains control of the acquiree. The consideration transferred in a business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any consideration\n\n<!-- image -->",

The consideration transferred excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\nFor each business combination, the Group measures at the acquisition date components of non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation at either: (a) fair value; or (b) the present ownership instruments' proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the amount of the proportionate share of the net assets acquired. These criteria are only applicable for non-controlling interests which grant entry into economic benefits and entitlement to the proportional part of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or value\n\n-\n\nbased on market conditions. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets transferred by the seller at the same time and following the same measurement criteria as the item that is subject to indemnification from the acquiree, taking into consideration, where applicable, the insolvency risk and any contractual limit on the indemnity amount.\n\nAny excess of the consideration given, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests, over the value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. Any shortfall, after evaluating the consideration given, the value assigned to non-controlling interests, and after identifying and measuring the net assets acquired, is recognised separately in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIf the business combination can only be determined provisionally the identifiable net assets are initially recognised at their provisional values and adjustments made during the measurement period are recognised as if they had been known at the acquisition date. Comparative figures for the previous year are restated where applicable. In any event, adjustments to provisional amounts only reflect information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition\n\ndate and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised at that date.\n\nAfter a period of one year, the initial measurement is only adjusted when correcting errors.\n\n## b) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment primarily comprise technical electricity facilities and are measured at cost of production or acquisition, as appropriate, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value.\n\nThis cost includes the following items, where applicable:\n\n- > Borrowing costs directly related to property, plant and equipment under construction accrued on external financing solely during the construction period. Nevertheless, capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended when active development is interrupted for extended periods, except where a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Work in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment in use once these items come into service and provided that the assets are in working condition. Property, plant and equipment under construction are not depreciated.\n\nAfter initial recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are measured on a cost basis, and recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment.\n\nEnlargement or improvement expenses which lead to an increase in productivity or capacity\n\nand lengthen the useful life of the assets are stated as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs on property, plant and equipment that do not increase productivity or capacity and which do not lengthen the useful life of the assets are charged directly as expenses when incurred.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which is the period during which the assets are expected to be used, and in any case applying the following ranges of depreciation rates:\n\n## Annual depreciation rate\n\n| Buildings                                                          | 2% - 10%                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Technical electricity   facilities                                 | 2.5% - 8.5%                    |\n| Technical   telecommunications   facilities (fibre optics)         | 5% - 12.5%                     |\n| Technical   telecommunications   facilities (satellite)            | As per  depreciation  schedule |\n| Other installations,   machinery, equipment,   furniture and other |                                |\n| items                                                              | 4% - 33%                       |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment primarily comprise technical electricity and telecommunications facilities. Most undepreciated items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated at a rate of 2.5%. The depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually and adjusted, if necessary, to reflect actual circumstances. When the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their estimated recoverable amount, it is immediately written down to the recoverable amount. The Group performs complementary analyses of these indicators in view of the entry into force of the new remuneration regime applicable to electricity transmission assets in Spain (see note 3).\n\nWith respect to property, plant and equipment, in 2020 the Group conducted a study on the useful life of transmission assets that came into service before 1998, in view of the new remuneration model. This study was based on internal and external sources and demonstrated that, if certain operating conditions and appropriate operating and maintenance programmes were upheld, these facilities may have a longer useful life than that initially determined, ensuring security of operations in accordance with legal requirements.

The average remaining useful life of these assets is now 14 years (see note 8).\n\nRecoverable amount is understood to be the higher of:\n\n- > Fair value less costs to sell.\n- > Value in use, i.e. the present value of the estimated future cash flows from continued use of the asset and disposal thereof.\n\nGovernment grants received in relation to the acquisition of these assets are recognised as deferred income and taken to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are derecognised when retired; or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. Gains or losses on disposal of an item are calculated based on the difference between any net proceeds from selling the asset and its carrying amount (initial cost less depreciation and impairment).\n\n-\n\nThe gains or losses are taken to profit or loss in the year when the item is derecognised. These gains and losses are not included within results from ordinary activities.\n\nThe Group measures and determines impairment to be recognised or reversed in respect of the value of its cash-generating units (CGUs) based on the criteria in section h) of this note.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost, which is periodically reviewed and adjusted in the event of a decline in value. Amortisation for the year is expensed and determined on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life allocated to each item or type of intangible asset.\n\nIntangible assets include the following:\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is determined using the same criteria as for business combinations. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently where events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.\n\n## Computer software\n\nThis item includes computer software licences acquired, which are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software to use.\n\nComputer software maintenance costs are charged as expenses when incurred. Computer software must be amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years from the date on which each program comes into use.\n\n## Development expenses\n\nDevelopment expenses directly attributable to the design and execution of tests for new or improved computer programs that are identifiable, unique and likely to be controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be successful, based on its economic and commercial feasibility, and the associated costs can be estimated reliably. Costs that do not meet these criteria are charged as expenses when incurred. Development expenses are capitalised and amortised, from the date the associated asset comes into service, on a straight-line basis over a period of no more than five years. Computer software maintenance costs are charged as expenses when incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Licences are amortised on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives of five years.\n\nIndustrial property is initially measured at cost of acquisition or production and is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment. These assets are amortised over their useful lives of five years.\n\n## Administrative concessions\n\nThe Group operates various assets, located mainly in Peru, under service concession contracts awarded by different public entities. Based on the characteristics of the contracts, the Group analyses whether they fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements.\n\nFor concession arrangements subject to IFRIC 12, construction and other services rendered are recognised using the criteria applicable to income and expenses.\n\nThe consideration received by the Group is recognised at the fair value of the service rendered, as a financial asset or intangible asset, based on the contract clauses. The Group recognises the consideration received for construction contracts as an intangible asset to the extent that it is entitled to pass on to users the cost of access to or use of the public service, or it has no unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset. Where it does have an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor, and the grantor has little, if any, discretion to avoid payment, the consideration for the service is recognised as a financial asset applying a financial model.\n\nUpon initial recognition, an intangible asset received as consideration for construction or upgrade services rendered is recognised at fair value. The intangible asset is subsequently recognised at cost, including capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment.\n\nThe contractual obligations assumed by the Group to maintain the infrastructure during the operating period, or to carry out renovation work prior to returning the infrastructure to the transferor upon expiry of the concession arrangement, are recognised using the accounting policy described for provisions,\n\nto the extent that such activity does not generate revenue.\n\nConcession arrangements not subject to IFRIC 12 are recognised using general criteria.\n\nAdministrative concessions have a finite useful life and are recognised at acquisition cost, less accumulated amortisation and any impairment.\n\nConcessions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the concession period, as detailed in note 7.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThese primarily comprise the perpetual rights to regulated tariffs arising from the business combination. In light of the rights to receive perpetual income from the transmission line acquired as part of the Chilean National Transmission System, this asset, which was initially measured at fair value, has an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment on an annual basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their estimated recoverable amount, it must be written down immediately. The market value of the Group's investment property is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nInvestment property, except land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is the period during which the companies expect to use the assets. Investment property is depreciated at a rate of 2%.\n\n## e) Leases\n\nUntil the first-time application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the Group classified leases on the basis of whether the risks and rewards of ownership were substantially transferred, distinguishing between operating leases, wherein\n\nthe lessor retained a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset, and finance leases, wherein the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets were transferred to the Group. Assets recognised as finance leases were presented in the consolidated statement of financial position based on the nature of the leased asset.\n\nAs a result of applying IFRS 16, the Group assesses at the inception of a contract whether that contract contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The period of time during which the Group uses an asset includes consecutive and non-consecutive periods of time. The Group only reassesses the terms and conditions when the contract is modified.\n\n## Lessee\n\nIn contracts that contain one or more lease components or non-lease components, the Group assigns the consideration of the contract to each lease component in accordance with the independent sale price of the lease component and the aggregate individual price of the non-lease components.\n\nPayments made by the Group that do not constitute a transfer of goods or services thereto by the lessor, do not constitute a separate lease\n\ncomponent, but form part of the total consideration of the contract.\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less incentives received; initial direct costs incurred; and an estimate of dismantling or restoration costs to be incurred, pursuant to the criteria for provisions.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, unless the implicit interest rate of the lessor can be determined reliably.\n\nOutstanding lease payments comprise fixed payments, less any incentive receivable, variable payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of purchase options if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, providing the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.\n\nThe Group applies the impairment criteria for non-current assets described in section 4.3 to the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\n\nThe Group recognises variable payments not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nThe Group recognises remeasurements of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset, until the latter is reduced to zero, after which, it is taken to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the lease payments at a revised discount rate, if there has been a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability if there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or a change in the index or rate used to determine those payments, including a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review.\n\nThe Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone\n\nprice to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.\n\nFor a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, at the effective date of the lease modification the Group allocates the consideration in the modified contract applying the criteria described above, determines the lease term of the modified lease and remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The Group decreases the carrying amount of the right-ofuse asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease. The Group recognises in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease. The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset for all other lease modifications.\n\nThe Group has elected not to apply the accounting policies indicated for short-term leases and leases in which the value of the underlying asset is less than US Dollars 5,000 (approximately Euros 4,600).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivable and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. Finance income is taken to the income statement using the effective interest method.\n\nThe Group recognises operating lease income in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern in which benefits deriving from the leased asset are diminished.\n\n## f)  Financial assets and financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial instruments are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance\n\nwith the economic substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial asset, a financial liability and an equity instrument in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.\n\nThe Group recognises financial instruments when it becomes party to the contract or legal transaction, in accordance with the terms set out therein.\n\nA financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at its fair value plus, in the case of an item not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are initially measured at their transaction price.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Financial assets:\n\nUpon initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Assets are classified on the basis of the business model and contractual terms of the assets.\n\n- A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met and it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss:\n- > The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.\n- > The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n- A financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met and it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss:\n- > The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n- > The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets shall not be reclassified after initial recognition, unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.\n\nThe Group classifies financial assets, excluding equity-accounted investments, into the following categories:\n\n- > Amortised cost: financial assets classified under this category are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective\n\n-\n\ninterest method. Amortised cost is reduced for impairment losses. Interest income, exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gains or losses on derecognition are recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n- > Fair value through other comprehensive income: these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. The resulting net gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. Cumulative gains or losses in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition. In the case of equity instruments classified in this category, gains or losses arising from changes in fair value at the reporting date are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividends from equity investments classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n- > Fair value through profit or loss: these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains or losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities:\n\nFinancial liabilities, which include loans, payment obligations and similar commitments, are initially recognised at fair value less any transaction costs incurred. Such debt is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, except in the case of transactions for which hedges have been arranged (see section n).\n\nFinancial debt is classified under current liabilities unless the debt falls due more than 12 months after the reporting date, in which case it is classified as non-current.\n\n## Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets:\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset expire or are transferred in a transaction in which it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the transferred assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group also derecognises a financial liability when the terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability is recognised at fair value, based on the new terms. Upon derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## g) Inventories\n\nInventories of materials and spare parts are measured at cost of acquisition, which is calculated as the lower of weighted average price and net realisable value.\n\nThe cost of acquisition comprises the purchase price, import duties and other non-recoverable taxes, as well as transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the materials or services. Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the cost of acquisition.\n\nThe cost of any financing used to acquire the inventories can be recognised as an increase in the cost of the inventories until the assets are substantially ready for use or sale.\n\nThe Group assesses the net realisable value of inventories at the end of each reporting period, recognising impairment in the consolidated income statement when the cost exceeds market value or when it is uncertain whether the inventories will be used. When the circumstances that caused inventories to be written down no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances, the previously recognised impairment is reversed and recognised as income.\n\n## h) Impairment\n\n## Financial assets\n\nImpairment is calculated by applying the general approach used to calculate expected credit losses on financial assets; except trade receivables, for which the simplified approach set out in IFRS 9 is used, whereby impairment is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses of the asset.\n\nIn order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk of a financial asset since its initial recognition, or to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses of the\n\nasset, the Group considers all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost and effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information based on the experience of the Group or of other entities of historical credit losses, and observable market information about the credit risk of the specific financial instrument or similar financial instruments. The Group assumes that the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. The Group also considers that a financial asset is in default when it is more than 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supported information that demonstrates its recoverability.\n\nThe Group considers that a debt instrument presents a low level of risk when its credit rating is at least 'investment grade' at one of the prestigious rating agencies. The maximum period over which expected credit losses are measured is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nIFRS 9 defines expected credit losses as the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a default occurring as the weights. Credit losses are measured as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with\n\n<!-- image -->",

PD is the probability of default. LGD is the loss that would be incurred in the event of debtor default and is calculated as (1 - recovery rate). The recovery rate depends on the specific guarantees of the receivable or loan. DF is the time value of money.\n\nFollowing a hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13, i.e. from most observable inputs to least observable inputs, the following methods are used:\n\n-\n\n- > If the debtor has quoted credit default swaps (CDS), the probability of default is generally obtained from the CDS, as this is the most objective market credit measure of the probability of default of a company at a specific point in time.\n- > If the debtor does not have a quoted CDS, the company's rating from each credit rating agency that has issued a report is selected and used to calculate the probability of default.\n- > If the debtor does not have a rating, a theoretical rating can be calculated by comparing the debtor's ratios with those of other companies that do have a rating.\n\nProvisions for impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.\n\nImpairment related to trade and other receivables, including, where appropriate, contract assets under IFRS 15, is presented in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Non-financial assets\n\nThe Group companies analyse the recoverability of their assets at each reporting date and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Impairment is deemed to exist\n\nwhen the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. An impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount of an asset and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and their value in use. Value in use is calculated on the basis of expected future cash flows. Impairment is calculated for individual assets. Where the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be determined, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which that asset belongs is calculated. Any reversals are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent years (see notes 7, 8, 9 and 10).\n\n## i)  Share capital, own shares and dividends\n\nShare capital is represented by ordinary shares. The cost of issuing new shares, net of taxes, is deducted from equity.\n\nOwn shares are measured at cost of acquisition and recognised as a reduction in equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Supplementary dividends are not deducted from equity until approved by the shareholders at their general meeting.\n\n## j) Grants\n\nNon-repayable government capital grants awarded by different official bodies to finance the Group's fixed assets are recognised once the corresponding investments have been made.\n\nThe Group recognises these grants under non-financial and other capital grants each year during the period in which depreciation is charged on the assets for which the grants were received.\n\nGovernment assistance provided in the form of income tax deductions and considered as government capital grants is recognised applying the general criteria described in the preceding sections.\n\n## k) Contract liabilities\n\nNon-current contract liabilities, generally arising from long-term contracts or commitments, are recognised under revenue or other operating income, as appropriate, over the term of the contract or commitment.\n\n## l) Provisions\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## > Pension obligations\n\nThe Group has defined contribution plans, whereby the benefit receivable by an employee upon retirement - usually based on one or more factors such as age, fund returns, years of service or remuneration - is determined by the contributions made. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are recognised under employee benefits when accrued.\n\n## > Other long-term employee benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits include defined benefit plans for benefits other than pensions (such as health insurance) for certain serving and retired personnel of the Group. The expected costs of these benefits are recognised under provisions over the working life of the employees. These obligations are measured each year by independent qualified actuaries. Changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised, net of taxes, in reserves under equity in the year in which they arise, while the past service cost is recorded in the consolidated income statement\n\nThis item also includes deferred remuneration schemes, which are approved by the competent bodies in each Group company (see note 16).\n\nIn 2015 the Group's Appointments and Remuneration Committee approved the implementation of a Structural Management Plan (hereinafter the 'Plan') for certain members of the management team, with the aim of processing, in an orderly and efficient manner, the replacement and administration of the management positions covered in the Plan.

Participation in the Plan is subject to meeting certain conditions, and the Plan may be modified or withdrawn by the Group under certain circumstances, including a prolonged decline in the Group's results (see note 16).\n\n## Other provisions\n\nThe Group makes provision for present obligations (legal or constructive) arising as a result of a past event whenever it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provision is made when the liability or obligation is recognised. No provision is made for proceedings with a probability of occurrence of less than 50% as it is considered that their future resolution will not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n-\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax risk-free discount rate that reflects assessments of the time value of money. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## m)  Transactions in currency other than the Euro\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currency of the Group companies at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency using the closing exchange rate. Exchange gains and losses arising during the year due to balances being translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date rather than the exchange rate prevailing on the date of collection or payment are recognised as income or expenses in the consolidated income statement.\n\nFixed income securities and balances receivable and payable in currencies other than the Euro at 31 December each year are translated at the closing exchange rate. Any exchange differences arising are recognised under exchange gains/losses in consolidated profit or loss.\n\nTransactions conducted in foreign currencies for which the Group has chosen to mitigate currency risk by arranging financial derivatives or other hedging instruments are recorded using the criteria for derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Euros using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Euros using the exchange rates at the transaction dates.\n\nTranslation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity.\n\n## n)  Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to cover its exposure to currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments for covering variability in the cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The criterion used to recognise the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the hedged item.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity at that time remains in equity, and is immediately reclassified to the consolidated income statement\n\n-\n\nas and when changes in cash flows of the hedged item occur. Any cumulative gain or loss is also reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nThe Group recognises the portion of the gain or loss on the measurement at fair value of a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion and the specific component of the gain or loss or cash flows on the hedging instrument, excluding the measurement of the hedge effectiveness, are recognised with a debit or credit to finance costs or finance income.\n\nThe separate component of other comprehensive income associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge and the cumulative change in fair value or present value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge. However, if the Group expects that all or a portion of a loss recognised in other comprehensive income will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it reclassifies into finance income or finance costs the amount that is not expected to be recovered.\n\nDetails of the fair value of the hedging derivatives used are disclosed in note 20 . Details of changes in equity are provided in note 14.\n\n## o) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.\n\nThe fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities are classified on the basis of a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value. The hierarchy comprises three levels:\n\n- > Level 1: measurement is based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n- > Level 2: measurement is based on inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.\n- > Level 3: measurement is based on inputs derived from unobservable market data.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specifically, the Group calculates the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not traded on organised markets using valuation techniques, including recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analyses using the market interest rates and exchange rates in force at the reporting date, and option pricing models enhanced to reflect the particular circumstances of the issuer.\n\n## p) Trade payables\n\nTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Trade payables falling due in less than one year that have no contractual interest rate and are expected to be settled in the short term are measured at their nominal amount.\n\n-\n\n## q) Income and expenses\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised according to the pattern of transfer of goods and services to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring these goods or services.\n\nThe majority of the Group's revenues are regulated revenues from transmission and system operation activities in Spain (see notes 24 and 28). The Group subsidiary Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. has been designated by the Spanish electricity sector regulator (currently the Ministry for the Ecological Transition, or MITECO) to carry out the electricity transmission and system operation activities on an exclusive basis. Both of these activities are regulated by Electricity Industry Law 24/2013. This legislation, which was subsequently enacted by Royal Decree 1047/2013, provides that the amount of remuneration receivable is to be set annually by MITECO, at the proposal of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), and should cover the services the Company renders to consumers and other electricity sector agents on an uninterrupted basis throughout the year. The obligations to construct, operate and maintain electricity transmission facilities set out in the law are considered to be a single performance obligation, and the total price is therefore allocated in full to that performance obligation.\n\nSimilarly, the legal obligations included within the obligation of the electricity system operator are understood to comprise a single performance obligation, identified as 'providing the electricity system operation service'. As a result, revenue from the performance obligations of transmission and system operation services is recognised over time, on a straight-line basis, based on the remuneration set for each year.\n\nRevenue associated with the telecommunications business essentially derives from the following:\n\n- > contracts whereby the rights to use the fibre optic backbone network and cables are granted to different customers in the telecommunications sector, as well as services rendered to those customers, which are considered to be a single performance obligation.\n- > contracts to provide satellite capacity lease services to different customers in the telecommunications sector, which are considered to be a single performance obligation for which the revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over time, as the service is rendered to the customer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These reviews may result in an increase or reduction in revenue, which would be recognised in profit or loss for the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the review become known to and are agreed upon by the parties.\n\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## r) Taxation\n\nThe income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event that is recognised in the same year, directly in equity, or from a business combination.\n\n-\n\nCurrent tax is the estimated tax payable for the year using the enacted tax rates applicable to the current year and to any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nTax credits and deductions arising from economic events occurring in the year are deducted from the income tax expense, unless there are doubts as to whether they can be realised.\n\nDeferred taxes and the income tax expense are calculated and recognised using the liability method, based on temporary differences arising between the balances recognised in the financial information and those used for tax purposes. This method entails calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities and their tax base, applying the tax rates that are objectively expected to apply to the years when the assets are realised and the liabilities settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised provided that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of the temporary differences that arise from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition to the factors to be considered for individual taxation, set out previously, the following factors are taken into account when determining the accrued income tax expense for the companies forming the consolidated tax group:\n\n- > Temporary and permanent differences arising from the elimination of profits and losses on transactions between Group companies, derived from the process of determining consolidated taxable income.\n- > Deductions and credits corresponding to each company forming the consolidated tax group. For these purposes, deductions and credits are allocated to the company that carried out the activity or generated the profit necessary to obtain the right to the deduction or tax credit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tax assets or tax liabilities calculated using these criteria that exceed the amount presented in the self-assessments are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. Changes in events or circumstances relating to tax uncertainties are recognised as a change in accounting estimates.\n\nThe Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n## s) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding own shares.\n\nAccording to the consolidated annual accounts of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group at 31 December 2020 and 2019, basic earnings per share are the same as diluted earnings per share, as no transactions that could have resulted in a change in those figures were conducted during those years.\n\n## t) Insurance\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group companies have taken out various insurance policies to cover the risks to which the companies are exposed\n\nthrough their activities. These risks mainly comprise damage that could be caused to the Group companies' facilities and possible claims that might be lodged by third parties due to the companies' activities. Insurance premium expenses and income are recognised in the consolidated income statement on an accruals basis. Payouts from insurance companies in respect of claims are recognised in the consolidated income statement when they are receivable.\n\n## u) Environmental issues\n\nCosts derived from business activities intended to protect and improve the environment are charged as expenses in the year in which they are incurred. Property, plant and equipment acquired to minimise environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment are recognised as an increase in property, plant and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This remuneration is measured based on the closing quotation of these shares at the delivery date. The costs incurred on such schemes are recognised under personnel expenses in the consolidated income statement. All shares delivered as payment are taken from the own shares held by the Parent.\n\n## w)  Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this could result in the recognition of income that may never be realised, except in business combinations to the extent that they represent indemnification assets. Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements, except in business combinations to the extent that they represent present obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are assessed continually and if it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n## Considerations Regarding COVID-19 in the Consolidated Annual Accounts\n\nThe emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China early in the year and its rapid spread to a number of countries across the globe led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the viral outbreak a pandemic by mid-March.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the health crisis and the substantially global nature of the markets in this day and age, the short- and medium-term outlook remains uncertain, and economic growth around the world could differ depending on how\n\nthe spread of infections and the roll-out of vaccines unfold. The pandemic is lingering beyond initial expectations, and its consequences will largely depend on the amount of time needed to completely eradicate the virus. The ability to move forward from the pandemic will largely depend on the rate at which vaccines are authorised and produced, and the pace at which States and their healthcare systems roll out the vaccines to high percentages of the population in a bid to achieve herd immunity. These are the pivotal factors in play if global economic activity is to recover and resume pre-crisis levels.\n\nIn Spain, the healthcare predicament stemming from the pandemic called for the government to take exceptional measures. It did so in March by publishing Royal Decree 463/2020 declaring a nationwide state of emergency, which was subsequently extended on more than one occasion and ultimately lifted in June. At the end of the summer season, new outbreaks occurring nationwide in Spain prompted the government to declare a new state of emergency in October, through Royal Decree 926/2020, which was then extended until 9 May 2021. As highlighted by both Royal Decrees and the accompanying regulations issued during this period, the need to guarantee the supply of energy in general, and electricity in particular, continues to be a priority.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These measures have been executed in parallel with the priority of guaranteeing the health of the Company's employees and observing the health authorities' policy to slow the spread of infections. Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a has spared no efforts or resources when it comes to deploying whatever measures have become necessary to ensure that the electricity system remains up and running in these critical times. By way of example, the Company set up a third electricity control centre in record time.\n\nOnce the toughest lockdown in the first half of the year was lifted, all facilities operation and maintenance activities in Spain were fully resumed and the construction of new infrastructure is now underway again, while all measures temporarily put in place to ensure network availability and to resolve incidents and faults have come to an end.\n\nNo incidents occurred in Spain in 2020 that posed a risk as regards meeting electricity demand and keeping the system up and running correctly; neither were any transmission network incidents recorded that in any way compromised the operation of the Spanish electricity system.\n\nHowever, the decline in demand for electricity in Spain in 2020, by 5.1% in the mainland system and 13.7% in non-mainland systems, has posed a significant challenge as regards system operation. In the first half of the year, drops of up to 20% vis-\u00e0-vis equivalent periods in the prior year were seen in some cases. These fluctuations in demand have required voltage controls to be implemented in the Spanish electricity system. Additional energy scheduling in view of technical restrictions due to voltage controls and more intensive use of available resources in the transmission network have enabled the exceptional situation stemming from COVID-19 to be managed with no incidents.\n\nBoth the international electricity infrastructure business and the telecommunications business have been providing essential services with no incidents arising. Specifically, as regards ensuring the continuity of the satellite business, a contingency plan was drawn up for the control centres, ground stations and other facilities related with satellite operations or telecommunications signals transmission, in order for skeleton operations to remain ongoing and to provide\n\ncontinuous customer support to keep services up and running.\n\nIn international business, despite shrinking demand for electricity in Latin America, which suffered a steep decline in March before picking up again in the months that followed, network availability has been maintained, thus helping to guarantee security of supply through the continuity of operations as an essential service.\n\nWithin this context, Red El\u00e9ctrica has followed the guidelines adapted to the recommendations issued by the different pertinent authorities in Spain as well as in each market of operations, with the priority of preserving the health and safety of all of its employees, customers and suppliers.\n\nWith this in mind, measures were implemented at the onset of the health crisis to allow for flexibility and to enable all staff whose physical presence in the workplace was not strictly necessary to work from home, so as to guarantee security of supply for electricity and telecommunications. Implementation of this measure was only possible thanks to the digitalisation process developed by the Group in recent years, which has entailed considerable\n\n<!-- image -->",

All people in the high-risk group continue to work from home, and office-based work resumed in Spain in September.\n\nFrom a financial and economic perspective, throughout this period the Group's financial position has been robust, enabling it to confront these trying times through measures aimed at bolstering its liquidity. In 2020 the Group made two bond issues for a total amount of Euros 1,100 million, by way of Euros 700 million in January and Euros 400 million in April, and also entered into loan and credit facility agreements amounting to Euros 475 million (see note 19) . Following these transactions, and having already settled due debts and the payments arising from the acquisition of Argo Energia in Brazil, the Group's liquidity position at the end of 2020 stands at Euros 2,412 million, specifically Euros 482 million in available cash and Euros 1,930 million in available credit facilities. This position ensures the Group's ability to meet its operating cash flow requirements, to honour debt maturities for the coming years, and to address any adverse situations that could emerge\n\n-\n\nin the financial markets over the coming months as a result of developments in the current crisis (see note 18) . In the next two years the Group will need to repay debt amounting to Euros 1,206 million, on the basis of Euros 164 million in 2021 and Euros 1,042 million in 2022 (see note 19).\n\nThe situation brought on by COVID-19 has not had a significant impact on the continuity of the Group's operations. Nonetheless, in early February the Group activated a monitoring committee, enabling the implementation of an exhaustive contingency plan.\n\nSince the onset of the crisis, the Group has been continuously monitoring the estimated impact that the situation arising from management of the COVID-19 fall-out could have on its profits and its investments in projects underway. The main conclusions drawn from the analyses performed and from the impact assessment are as follows:\n\n- > Most of the sectors in which the Group has its operations in Spain and Latin America are regulated sectors. As such, and despite lingering uncertainties as to the impact of the pandemic on the economies of the different countries in which the Group operates, it has not had an effect on revenue from the Group's regulated activities, which makes up most of the overall revenue. However, the pandemic has had an impact on revenue from the\n\ntelecommunications activity, as will be explained later in this report.\n\n- > The construction of new electricity transmission and telecommunications infrastructure experienced temporary delays due to the total or partial stoppage of economic activities imposed by the authorities. These activities resumed practically in full in the closing months of the year. The impact of COVID-19 on the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's investments as a whole is tantamount to approximately 5% of the initially envisaged volume of investment. This impact, which is expected to be recovered in 2021, is mainly concentrated in transmission network development in Spain, although Latin America has likewise seen slight delays in the development of the new HISPASAT Amazonas Nexus satellite.\n- > The Group began to resume activity in both Spain and Latin America once the strictest lockdown was lifted, as mentioned above, and at no point did it stop providing the essential services that are its remit. Therefore, the Group's operations were not interrupted to any great extent during the state of emergency, employment was maintained, and it has not had to resort to furlough measures (see note 16).\n\n<!-- image -->",

At 31 December these expenses amount to approximately Euros 5 million (see note 24).\n- > The satellite telecommunications activity has been affected both by the duration of the crisis, which is proving far more protracted and severe than could have initially been foreseen, and the situation in the Latin American markets where it operates. This situation was exacerbated in the second half of 2020 particularly. There have\n\nbeen price renegotiations, contract rescissions, delays or cancellations of government projects, whether announced or already awarded and underway, and certain customers have filed for insolvency. This impact is expected to continue affecting revenue in the coming years. Another factor that could largely be attributed to the COVID-19 crisis is the deterioration of exchange rates in terms of both the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real, currencies in which HISPASAT receives a substantial portion of its revenue.\n\nThese factors - price renegotiations, cancellations of contracts and projects, and the performance of the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real - have had a negative impact of around Euros 20 million on revenue from the Group's satellite business in 2020. As a result of the changes in HISPASAT's governing bodies in 2019 and 2020, and in view of the situation generated by the pandemic in the first half of the year, the unexpected (at least in terms of intensity) new outbreaks in the second half of the year, the faster pace of the satellite sector trans-formation process recorded in the second half of the year, and the impacts on revenue mentioned earlier, HISPASAT engaged in a strategic reflection process during the second half of 2020, with the assistance of an external consultant specialised in the satellite business, and also supported by sector reports produced by prestigious firms in the industry. This process led HISPASAT's board of directors\n\nto define new strategies for the Group at the end of 2020, aimed at repositioning HISPASAT as a benchmark operator in the provision of advanced satellite communications services (new business), while also endeavouring to protect its traditional activity centred on the operation of communications satellites and the wholesale lease of spatial capacity, maximising the useful life of the existing fleet.\n\nThis new strategy brings in a particularly relevant change as regards the management of HISPASAT and its business. In this respect, the assets of the traditional business (Legacy) continue to be allocated to the Legacy cashgenerating unit (CGU), while investments associated with new business are grouped in other CGUs, inasmuch as the new satellite assets are unlikely to be able to be operated in conjunction with those of the traditional (Legacy) fleet in view of foreseeable differences in their technical characteristics and the different services they will provide, and because they will also generate inflows that are separate from those obtained from the traditional business using the Legacy fleet.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Business Plan was drawn up using the most probable of all the scenarios analysed. As a result of this exercise and the effects of the pandemic, the Group has had to recognise a provision of approximately Euros 122 million for impairment of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Legacy CGU.\n\nThe assumptions used to test non-financial assets for impairment are described in notes 7 and 8.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group is setting its sights on a green recovery as the only way out of the economic crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the Group, the focal point of this model is to foster an inclusive and fair energy transition. In this regard, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has joined forces with initiatives both in Spain and in the international arena that endorse\n\n-\n\nsustainability as a springboard to post-crisis economic recovery. These include the 'Manifesto for a Sustainable Recovery', championed by representatives from the political, corporate, trade union, scientific and third sector communities in Spain, and which is aligned with the Green Recovery Alliance in Europe, and the 'Uniting Business and Governments to Recover Better' statement, promoted by the prestigious Science Based Targets initiative and supported by the United Nations. These two initiatives are seeking to pave a way forward out of the COVID-19 crisis that places people, achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, and an ambitious climate-related action plan at the very heart.\n\nThe Group's management and directors will continue to assess the situation and closely monitor any incidents arising in the infrastructure it manages, as well as trends in other external factors and the impact such factors could have on the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Combinations\n\n## Business combinations carried out in 2019\n\n## Acquisition of HISPASAT S.A.\n\nOn 12 February 2019 Red El\u00e9ctrica Corporaci\u00f3n, S.A. announced the agreement reached with Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.

The purchase price for 89.68% of the share capital of HISPASAT was Euros 933 million. In accordance with applicable legislation, the parties sought the pertinent authorisation for the transaction, this being one of the conditions precedent for the agreement signed by the two parties to come into effect.

The fair value of the assets was analysed and the business projections allocable to these assets were adjusted, considering reductions in capacity lease revenue. The outcome of the calculations does not differ significantly from the carrying amount of the assets at the acquisition date.\n\nThe main fair value adjustments applied to the identifiable assets and liabilities of HISPASAT are as follows:\n\n- > Recognition of an intangible asset amounting to Euros 15.2 million, reflecting the value of the 'HISPASAT' trademark. This intangible asset has a finite useful life of 10 years. The intangible asset representing the HISPASAT trademark was essentially measured using the following methodology:\n- \u2202  The businesses were measured using the income approach, and in particular using the discounted cash flow method, based on Level 3 (i.e. unobservable) inputs.\n\n-\n\n- \u2202  The main measurement parameters used were as follows:\n- -  Post-tax discount rate for intangible assets: 8.5%.\n- -  Royalty rate: 1%.\n- \u2202  The most sensitive assumptions included in the projections, which are based on sector forecasts and the analysis of HISPASAT's historical data, are trends in royalties for use of the assets by the licensees, operating and maintenance costs, and investments. In general terms, the projections for the acquired businesses can be reasonably estimated on the basis of the agreements in place.\n- > Recognition of non-current and current assets amounting to Euros 51.4 million, mainly comprising the following:\n- \u2202  Euros 23.7 million of deferred tax assets, primarily reflecting tax deductions available at the transaction date, based on the Group's assessment of their future recoverability. These deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered within a period of no more than 10 years. In any case, most of the capitalised deductions would qualify for monetisation.\n- \u2202  Euros 25.3 million of contingent assets as the balancing entry for the contingent liabilities arising from tax litigation in Brazil, which are guaranteed by the seller under the sale-purchase agreement.\n- \u2202  Euros 3.7 million of deferred tax assets arising from the tax effect of fair value adjustments.\n- > Increase of Euros 13.6 million in financial liabilities, reflecting the difference between the estimated market value of financial debt and its carrying amount, of which Euros 9.8 million are non-current and Euros 3.8 million are current.\n- > Recognition of Euros 25.3 million under current liabilities, reflecting the contingent liabilities arising from tax litigation in Brazil related to the ICMS (Brazilian tax on the circulation of goods and services) as well as other taxes, mainly of an indirect nature, which have been contested and which are in turn guaranteed by Abertis under the salepurchase agreement. As these contingencies are guaranteed by the seller, the corresponding indemnification asset has been recognised for the same amount.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This intangible asset has been valued by independent experts using the income approach. The income approach aims to define the market value of a business based on the present value of foreseeable future cash flows by means of discounted cash flow (DCF). The concession has been revalued at US Dollars 15.7 million (Euros 14.0 million).\n\nDeferred tax liabilities arise from the revaluation of the above-mentioned concession, due to differences between accounting amortisation and tax amortisation.\n\nThis business combination entailed the recognition of goodwill, which is supported by the net recognition of deferred taxes because the fair value assigned to the net assets acquired was higher than the tax values. Goodwill was calculated as the difference between the cost of acquisition and fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities existing at the transaction date, including the deferred taxes arising from\n\nthe differences between the new fair value of the assets acquired and their tax value. Goodwill amounts to US Dollars 4.1 million (Euros 3.6 million).\n\nConsolidated revenue and the consolidated net loss for 2019 contributed since the date of acquisition amounted to Euros 6.4 million and Euros 2.2 million, respectively. Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2019, the consolidated revenue and net loss contributed would have amounted to Euros 14.9 million and Euros 4.7 million, respectively.\n\nThe Group incurred acquisition costs of Euros 0.5 million. These costs were included under other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In both cases they relate to the construction of facilities operated by these companies under a concession, and which came into service in 2020 in the case of TESUR 3.\n\nOther intangible assets amounting to Euros 45,242 thousand reflect the perpetual right to regulated tariffs arising from the acquisition of transmission facilities forming part of the Chilean National Transmission System, included in REDENOR 2. This item is not amortised as it has an indefinite useful life, and is tested for impairment annually.\n\nOperating expenses of Euros 12,105 thousand incurred directly in connection with intangible assets were capitalised in 2020 (Euros 15,572 thousand in 2019).\n\n-\n\nDuring 2020 the Group capitalised borrowing costs of Euros 388 thousand as an increase in intangible assets (Euros 843 thousand in 2019).\n\n- At 31 December 2020 the Group has fully amortised intangible assets amounting to Euros 17,788 thousand (Euros 18,550 thousand in 2019), most of which comprise development expenses and computer software.\n- At 31 December 2020 the carrying amount of intangible assets located outside of Spain is Euros 383,962 thousand (Euros 436,742 thousand in 2019).\n\nIn addition, at the 2020 and 2019 year ends, the Group carried out impairment testing on intangible assets that presented indications of impairment and those with an indefinite useful life.\n\nIn other intangible assets, impairment testing did not bring to light the need for any write-downs at 31 December 2020.\n\nWhen testing for impairment, the Group considered projections of future cash flows.\n\nThe projections refer to the 2021-2069 period and consider a perpetuity growth rate thereafter. The most representative assumptions included in the projections used, based on business forecasts and own past experience, are as follows:\n\n- > Regulated remuneration: estimated based on the remuneration approved in legislation for the years available, whilst the same update mechanisms as those set out in prevailing legislation have been used for subsequent years.\n- > Investment: the best information available on the asset investment and maintenance plans for the infrastructure throughout the estimated time period has been used.\n- > Operating and maintenance costs: projected in line with the growth expected to derive from the investment plan.\n- > Other costs: projected based on knowledge of the sector and past experience and in line with the growth expected to derive from the investment plan.\n- > Growth rate: a perpetuity growth rate of 2% has been estimated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No sensitivities have been applied to other assumptions, in view of the activity's regulated nature.\n\nIn the case of intangible assets that present indications of impairment, these have been tested for impairment and a write-down of Euros 5,679 thousand has been recognised, corresponding to the intangible assets allocated to the traditional satellite business (Legacy) CGU. The assumptions used in the calculation thereof are explained in note 8.\n\nAt the 2020 reporting date, the Group has performed impairment testing to determine the recoverability of goodwill arising on business combinations, and has not needed to recognise any impairment as a result.\n\nThe goodwill arising from the business combination entailing the acquisition of the Hispasat Group for Euros 228 million in October 2019, in the telecommunications segment, has been allocated to the group of CGUs pertaining to the satellite business, more specifically the traditional satellite business (Legacy) CGU and the CGU(s) for new business and satellite services, as this is the level of aggregation at which goodwill is controlled for internal management purposes of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group.\n\nThe Group first tested the traditional business (Legacy) CGU for impairment, without including any goodwill, and recognised an impairment loss at CGU level of Euros 122 million, of which Euros 5.7 million and Euros 116.6 million pertain to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively. The Group then tested the group of CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated (the Legacy CGU and the CGU(s) for new business and satellite services) for impairment, and no impairment was detected at that level.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the calculations for the impairment test on the Group's satellite business were as follows:\n\n- > The test was performed estimating the fair value less costs to sell, taking an income approach for the purpose of determining the recoverable amount of the satellite business.\n\nThe income approach indicates the recoverable amount of a business based on the present value of the future cash flows it is expected to generate, calculated using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology. The DCF method is used to discount the future free cash flow (FCF) to its estimated present value, applying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital or WACC) that reflects the time value of money and the risks associated with the expected cash flows. Costs to sell have been estimated considering the costs incurred on previous transactions carried out by the Group. In terms of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, the fair value measurement has been entirely categorised within Level 3, without consideration of whether the costs of disposal are observable.\n\n- > The latest projections considered in the Business Plan associated with the HISPASAT subgroup's New Strategic Plan approved in December 2020 by its board of directors have been applied. The cash flow projections used are for the 2021-2040 period, which is consistent with the useful life of the existing satellites, as well as that of the new satellite assets expected to be launched in the coming years and the HISPASAT subgroup's expected\n\n<!-- image -->",

The terminal value associated with the traditional technology is zero, given that the infrastructure supporting this business will cease to generate revenue and expenses once it reaches the end of its useful life. For new business and services, a terminal value with a perpetuity growth rate of 0.75% has been applied, which is in line with that considered by analysts for comparable companies and has been contrasted by an independent consultant.\n\n- > The EBITDA margin considered for traditional business and new business jointly averages 58%. The Group has determined the EBITDA margin based on past performance, forecast market development and market comparables. The margins considered are consistent with external information sources and their reasonableness has been contrasted by an independent consultant.\n- > The main exchange rates considered for foreign currency cash flows were 1.23 EUR/USD and 6.38 EUR/BRL.\n\n-\n\n- > A discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been used to discount the cash flows, specifically a post-tax rate of 5.9% has been applied for the traditional satellite business, and an additional risk premium has been included for new business, giving a post-tax rate of 7.5%.\n\nThe Group has performed a sensitivity analysis considering reasonable variations in the main operating and financial assumptions used in the calculation. The following increases and decreases are assumed:\n\n| Revenue           | -2.5%     | +2.5%     |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin      | -130 b.p. | +130 b.p. |\n| USD exchange rate | -5%       | +5%       |\n| BRL exchange rate | -15%      | +15%      |\n| Discount rate     | +40 b.p.  | -40 b.p.  |\n\nThe range of variation for the sensitivity analysis of the main operating assumptions has been estimated by weighting the relative weight of each one in the different CGUs to which goodwill was allocated.\n\nFor the revenue sensitivity range, the sensitivity analysis performed considers the impact of variations in revenue on the recoverable amount, applying a baseline variation in revenue from services rendered of \u00b1 4% and \u00b1 2% for the Legacy CGU and the new business CGU, respectively. For the new business CGU, this baseline was obtained from the average variation in total forecast revenue for 2021-2025 identified in the sector reports produced by independent experts in recent years, which reflect a variation of around 2%. Details of the baseline used for the Legacy CGU are provided in note 8.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was also performed on the EBITDA margin reflected in the projections supporting the recoverable amount, applying an increase/decrease in operating expenses that entails a variation in the annual EBITDA margin over the time horizon of the projections of \u00b1 200 b.p. and \u00b1100 b.p. for the Legacy CGU and the new business CGU, respectively. This range of variation for the EBITDA margin is deemed reasonable, considering that HISPASAT has made a detailed estimate of the cost structure necessary to carry out the projects considered in the Strategic Plan, and taking\n\n<!-- image -->",

The variations included in the sensitivity analysis are \u00b1 5% for EUR/USD and \u00b1 15% for EUR/BRL. These references were obtained on the basis of the average annual daily variations, in absolute terms, in each exchange rate during the 2015-2020 period (see note 8).\n\n-\n\nFor the discount rate sensitivity range, the sensitivity analysis performed considers the impact on the recoverable amount of variations in the rate of \u00b1 10 b.p. and \u00b1 50 b.p. for the Legacy CGU and the new business CGU, respectively. These variations consider the risk spread associated with these two CGUs.\n\nThe analysis performed reveals that at 31 December 2020 any reasonably possible variation in any of the key assumptions considered, on which the recoverable amount of the Group's satellite business is based, would not result in the aggregate carrying amount of the group of CGUs (Euros 1,037 million), to which the goodwill has been allocated, exceeding the aggregate recoverable amount of the CGUs. The recoverable amount at 31 December 2020 is approximately 30% higher than the carrying amount.\n\nThe Group has contrasted the assumptions used in testing the Legacy CGU and the goodwill for impairment, and the measurement performed, with prestigious independent experts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8 Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nMovement in property, plant and equipment in 2020 and 2019, and details of accumulated depreciation and impairment, are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main additions to technical electricity facilities in 2020 and 2019 are investments in electricity transmission facilities in Spain.\n\nTechnical telecommunications facilities essentially consist of the concession of the rights to use and manage the operation of the fibre optic cable network and other related items, pursuant to the 20-year agreement entered into by REINTEL with ADIF in 2014, as well as investments associated with the Group's fleet of satellites, which comprise the HISPASAT 30W-4, HISPASAT 30W-5, HISPASAT 30W-6, HISPASAT 36W-1, Amazonas 2, Amazonas 3, HISPASAT 74W-1, Amazonas 5 and HISPASAT 55W-2.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost of acquisition, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment (except for assets acquired in business combinations, which are initially recognised at fair value). Cost of acquisition includes the price paid for the asset,\n\n-\n\npersonnel expenses, operating expenses and any borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or manufacture of the asset.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the amount presented in additions and other mainly reflects the investments made during the year, as well as the technical facilities received under agreements with third parties.\n\nAs a result of first-time application of IFRS 16, right-of-use assets amounting to Euros 11,376 thousand arose in 2019 in relation to leases, of which Euros 3,794 thousand reflects vehicles and Euros 7,582 thousand reflects buildings.\n\nAt 31 December 2019, the amount shown under exits, disposals, reductions and writedowns mainly reflects the disposal of certain fully-depreciated assets.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group companies capitalised construction-related borrowing costs of Euros 7,100 thousand as an increase in property, plant and equipment (Euros 6,869 thousand in 2019). The weighted average rate used to capitalise borrowing costs was 1.2% in 2020 (1.6% in 2019).\n\nOperating expenses of Euros 45,585 thousand incurred directly in connection with property, plant and equipment under construction were capitalised in 2020 (Euros 44,511 thousand in\n\n2019). The Group's capitalised expenses directly related to the construction of facilities include all operating expenses incurred to provide support to the units directly involved in the activity.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group has fully depreciated property, plant and equipment amounting to Euros 2,645,950 thousand, of which Euros 2,451,876 thousand comprises technical electricity facilities (Euros 2,516,967 thousand in 2019, of which Euros 2,335,545 thousand comprised technical electricity facilities).\n\nDetails of capital grants and other non-current revenue received in advance, in relation to property, plant and equipment, are provided in note 15.\n\nThe Group has taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to its property, plant and equipment. These policies provide adequate protection against the risks covered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group periodically places orders to cover needs related to its investment plans. The various amounts in the aforementioned orders will normally materialise in the form of delivery orders as and when the different projects included in the plans are capitalised. Therefore, they do not constitute firm purchase commitments at the time of issue.\n\nThe Group has cash-generating units (CGUs) that group together items of property, plant and equipment. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The CGUs identified in property, plant and equipment are related to electricity transmission in Spain and Chile, fibre optic telecommunications in Spain, the satellite business (traditional business (Legacy) CGU and new business CGUs) and certain individual assets. In the second half of 2020, development of some of the assets that will make up the satellite business CGU(s) associated with new business got underway. Specifically,\n\nat 31 December 2020 assets under construction pertaining to new business, whose cash flows and operations are separate from those of the traditional satellite business (Legacy) CGU, amounted to Euros 0.9 million, approximately.\n\nThe Group tests for impairment when it observes indications, such as amendments to sector regulations, changes in investment plans, or changes in business performance. In order to calculate impairment, the Group verifies that the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit with which the assets are associated, or of individual assets, exceeds the carrying amount. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the difference between the two, with a charge to impairment and gains/losses on disposal of fixed assets, up to the limit of the higher of: (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in use.\n\nImpairment losses recognised for an asset in prior years are reversed when a change arises in the estimate of its recoverable amount, increasing the value of the asset with a credit to results up to the limit of the carrying amount that the asset would have had if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which is understood to be the present value of estimated\n\nfuture cash flows. The Group considers an asset's recoverable amount to be its value in use, with the exception of the satellite business, for which fair value less costs to sell is used. Recoverable amount is calculated using the methodology described below.\n\nTo estimate the recoverable amount, the Group prepares forecasts of future cash flows after tax based on the best available estimates. These provisions include the best available estimates of income, expenses and investments, using past experience and future expectations in accordance with the prevailing regulatory framework.\n\nThe Group evaluates whether there are indications of possible impairment losses on non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation to verify whether the carrying amount of these assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It, therefore, tested the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of this CGU for impairment, calculating the CGU's fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell have been estimated considering the costs incurred on previous transactions carried out by the Group.\n\nThe impairment test brought to light impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in an amount of Euros 116.6 million and Euros 5.7 million, respectively, in the traditional satellite business (Legacy) CGU.\n\nThis calculation is based on discounted cash flow projections, the underlying assumption being the estimated future performance of the traditional business (Legacy) contained in the new financial projections approved by HISPASAT's board of directors in December 2020. These projections cover a five-year period. After five years, cash flows are extrapolated on the assumption that the cash flows of the traditional business (Legacy) will remain constant, without growth, until the end of the re-estimated useful life of the satellites that make up the current\n\n-\n\nfleet. The cash flows take past experience into consideration and have been estimated based on the best contemporary information available with respect to the performance of the traditional business (Legacy) as well as future market performance, contrasted with a specialised independent expert. The key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount include estimates of sales, operating margins and exchange rates for the explicit projection period and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which is corroborated by independent financial experts. The discount rates used are post-tax values and reflect the specific risks related to the markets and currencies in which HISPASAT operates.\n\nThe Group has applied the following key assumptions in calculating the recoverable amount (fair value less costs to sell) of the traditional satellite business (Legacy):\n\n- > Revenue estimated on the basis of the portfolio of existing contracts, the historical renewal rate, past experience from renegotiations of contracts executed in the second half of 2020 and new sales forecast for the expanding vertical markets identified by sector market research and included in the Strategic Plan, drawn up in conjunction with a specialised consultancy firm. The expanding vertical markets primarily stem from growth in managed capacity services, essentially due to increased\n\ndemand for data that can be provided by the Legacy fleet, constituting the main stimulus for sector growth. Revenue after the five-year period is extrapolated on the assumption that the cash flows of the traditional business (Legacy) will remain constant, without growth.\n\n- > Useful lives: 16.5 years as of the date of entry into commercial service for the fleet of satellites that make up the CGU, with the exception of the Amazonas-2, H74W-1 and H55W-2 satellites, for which the estimated useful life is 14.5, 13 and 15 years, respectively.\n- > Gross margin: the Group has determined the projected gross margin on the basis of current performance and expected market development, which are consistent with the forecasts included in the industry reports obtained in the closing months of 2020, and have been contrasted with a specialised external consultant. The average gross margin for the projected period used in the analysis is 66%.\n- > Year-end exchange rate for sales in foreign currency: 1.23 USD/EUR, 6.38 BRL/EUR and 24.36 MXN/EUR.\n- > Post-tax discount rate: 5.89%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, impairment was recognised in an amount of Euros 5.7 million for intangible assets (see note 7) and Euros 116.6 million for property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe events and circumstances that led to the recognition of these impairment losses are as follows:\n\n- > At the end of 2020, the traditional business which essentially centres on video applications using wide beam capacity - is gradually being replaced by new services and the developing vertical markets, primarily based on big data consumption associated with new technical solutions, although these have yet to become consolidated. This has a significant impact on the Group given the substantial contribution of video to its revenue. This trend in the satellite market has substantially picked up the pace during the year due to COVID-19.\n- > In this context, the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the conditions in which the commercial activity is carried out, accentuating the disequilibrium of supply and demand and having a significant\n\n-\n\neffect on the renegotiation of key contracts in the traditional business, sought by the Group's main customers, with a particular impact in the second half of 2020.\n\n- > Moreover, the unexpected persistence (at least in terms of intensity) of the COVID-19 crisis, with new outbreaks in the second half of the year, has led to additional limitations as regards the fulfilment of certain projects or commercial opportunities identified, which have in many cases been cancelled, resulting in the loss of forecast revenue.\n- > Likewise, the deterioration of exchange rates triggered by COVID-19, in general as regards the currencies of the Latin American countries in which the Group operates, but particularly with respect to the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real, has had a sizeable impact on estimated future revenue inasmuch as the Group receives a considerable portion of its earnings in those currencies.\n- > In consideration of these factors, HISPASAT redefined its strategy, the new approach being approved by its board of directors in December 2020, for the purpose of repositioning HISPASAT as a benchmark operator in the provision of advanced satellite communications services (new business), while also endeavouring to protect its traditional activity centred on the operation of communications satellites and the\n\nwholesale lease of spatial capacity, maximising the useful life of the existing fleet. Highlights of this redefinition include the following:\n\n- \u2202 One of the more substantial changes in this new strategy is the abandonment of home broadband projects in Brazil and Mexico, in view of market performance in these countries and the difficulties posed by the protracted COVID-19 lockdown in terms of the capacity for facilities roll-out in this user segment, thus placing a large number of internet service providers (ISPs) in financial difficulty, and inhibiting the competitive environment and market development in this segment. Other notable operators in the sector have likewise redirected their home broadband strategy.\n- \u2202 The new strategies identify business levers that will enable the loss of traditional business to be offset while also protecting the remaining business for the existing satellite fleet. The implementation and consolidation of these business models calls for greater verticalisation with a wider operating cost structure and, therefore, tighter margins.\n\nThe Legacy CGU is not expected to return to pre-crisis cash flows in the time horizon considered in the Business Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reference value was obtained by identifying revenue that is subject to greater uncertainty depending on the past experience and estimates calculated using the most recent information available.\n\nThis variation has been contrasted with external sector reports. The baseline variation in revenue considered in the sensitivity analysis of the recoverable amount exceeds the average variation in total forecast revenue for 2021-2025 identified in the sector reports produced by Euroconsult from 2016 to 2019, which reflect a variation of around 2%.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis on the variation in revenue is based on the assumption that HISPASAT's EBITDA margins will remain the same as those considered in the approved financial projections.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was also performed on the EBITDA margin reflected in the projections supporting the recoverable amount, applying an increase/decrease in operating expenses that entails a variation of \u00b1 200 b.p. in the annual EBITDA margin over the time horizon of the projections. This range of variation for the EBITDA margin is deemed reasonable, considering that\n\nHISPASAT has made a detailed estimate of the cost structure necessary to carry out the projects considered in the Strategic Plan, and taking as a reference the variation used by other operators with a degree of verticalisation similar to that which would be seen once the new strategies approved by the board of directors are put into action.\n\nThe currencies considered in the sensitivity analysis reflecting the impact of a variation in the exchange rate used in the projections supporting the calculation of the recoverable amount are those which represent virtually the entire currency risk, namely the US Dollar (USD) and the Brazilian Real (BRL). The variations included in the sensitivity analysis are \u00b1 5% for EUR/USD and \u00b1 15% for EUR/BRL. These references were obtained on the basis of the average annual daily variations, in absolute terms, in each exchange rate during the 2015-2020 period.\n\nAs regards EUR/USD, the range of variation in the average exchange rate used over the time horizon of the projections is between 1.17 and 1.29, taking into consideration the average exchange rate of 1.14 for the last 5 years and 1.21 for the last 10 years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(TEN), in which the Group holds a 50% interest through Red El\u00e9ctrica Chile SpA, Hisdesat Servicios Estrat\u00e9gicos, S.A., in which the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group holds a 38.56% interest, and Grupo de Navegaci\u00f3n Sistemas y Servicios, S.L., in which the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group holds a 12.82% interest (these latter two investments are both through HISPASAT S.A.), as well as Argo Energia Empreendimentos e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A., which was acquired on 25 March 2020 (see note 2.g). As joint ventures, these companies are included in the financial statements of the Group using the equity method (see note 2 d).\n\n- > TEN was incorporated on 1 March 2007 and undertook the project in Chile for the construction of a transmission line spanning approximately 580 km and the corresponding substations. This project has connected the\n\n-\n\nCONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nFar North Interconnection System to the Central Interconnected System in Chile since 2018. TEN currently operates and maintains the facilities constructed. The acquisition price was US Dollars 217,560 thousand (Euros 199,816 thousand).\n\n- > Hisdesat Servicios Estrat\u00e9gicos, S.A. engages in the commercialisation of spatial systems for government use. Grupo de Navegaci\u00f3n Sistemas y Servicios, S.L. engages in the operation of satellite systems. Both companies form part of HISPASAT, which joined the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group on 3 October 2019, as indicated in note 6.\n- > Argo Energia Empreendimentos e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. was incorporated in Brazil in 2016 and holds three 30-year electricity concessions in that country, encompassing 1,460 km of 500 kV and 230 kV high-voltage lines and 11 substations, of which 1,150 km of lines and five substations have been operating since October 2019.\n\nOn 22 November 2019, Red El\u00e9ctrica Corporaci\u00f3n, S.A. announced the agreement whereby Red El\u00e9ctrica Internacional, S.A.U., through its subsidiary Red El\u00e9ctrica Brasil, and Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1 jointly acquired, on a fifty-fifty basis, all of the shares held by the funds managed by Patria Investments and Temasek in Argo Energia Empreendimentos e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. ('Argo Energia').\n\nIn accordance with applicable legislation, the parties sought the pertinent authorisation for the transaction, this being one of the conditions precedent for the agreement signed by the two parties to come into effect. This condition precedent was fulfilled on 25 March 2020, the date on which payment of the transaction was made, and on which Red El\u00e9ctrica Corporaci\u00f3n and Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1 assumed effective control of the board of directors of Argo Energia. Thus, on 25 March 2020 the Brazilian company in which the Group holds a 50% interest joined the Red El\u00e9ctrica consolidated Group. This company is the parent of a group of electricity transmission concession operator companies in Brazil.\n\nThe purchase price for 50% of the share capital of Argo Energia was BRL 1,678.2 million (Euros 374.3 million). The company has not distributed any dividends since the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result of this transaction, and applying the criteria laid down in IAS 28, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group is carrying out a purchase price allocation (PPA) through an independent expert, identifying the assets and liabilities of the joint venture that are measured at fair value. On a provisional basis, until the necessary calculations are finalised, the\n\nGroup has performed a preliminary PPA, giving rise to provisional implicit goodwill of Brazilian Reais 930 million (Euros 238 million) which has been allocated to the concession as an intangible asset. The definitive amounts will be determined within the 12-month period provided for by IFRS 3, which ends on 25 March 2021, to reflect the information, facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such testing was performed on the investment in TEN in 2020 and the value in use exceeded the carrying amount. Thus, the Group concluded that this investment is not impaired.\n\nThe most representative assumptions included in the projections used, based on business forecasts and own past experience, are as follows:\n\n- > Regulated remuneration: estimated based on the remuneration approved in legislation for the years available, whilst the same update mechanisms as those set out in prevailing legislation have been used for subsequent years.\n- > Investment: the best information available on the asset investment and maintenance plans for the infrastructure throughout the estimated time period has been used.\n- > Operating and maintenance costs: projected in line with the growth expected to derive from the investment plan.\n\n-\n\n- > Other costs: projected based on knowledge of the sector and past experience and in line with the growth expected to derive from the investment plan.\n\nIn order to calculate present value, the projected cash flows are discounted using a post-tax rate that considers the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the business and the geographical area in which it is carried out. A discount rate of 5.3% has been estimated at 31 December 2020 based on the Group's internal methodology for calculating the WACC, with a residual value that assumes constant growth at 2% as the perpetuity variation rate for the cash flows generated by the assets analysed; and an investment in fixed assets equal to the amount of depreciation to stabilise net assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12\n\n## Inventories\n\nDetails of inventories at 31 December 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\n## / Thousands of Euros /\n\n|             | 2020   | 2019               |\n|-------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Inventories | 69,671 | 76,124             |\n| Write-downs |        | (34,796)  (33,404) |\n| Total       | 34,875 | 42,720             |\n\nInventories mainly reflect materials and spare parts related to the technical electricity facilities.\n\nThe Group companies regularly test inventories for impairment based on the following assumptions:\n\n- > Impairment of old inventories, using inventory turnover ratios.\n- > Impairment for excess inventories, on the basis of estimated use in future years.\n\nAs a result, the Group recorded impairment losses of Euros 1,392 thousand in the consolidated income statement for 2020 (Euros 510 thousand in 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->",

At 31 December 2020 and 2019 the balances mostly comprise amounts pending invoicing and/or collection for regulated transmission and system operation activities. Under the settlement system set up by the Spanish regulator, some of these receivables are settled and collected in the following year. These amounts also include the revenue receivable derived from applying the methodology set forth in the remuneration model in force for transmission activities in Spain, which stipulates that facilities entering into service in year 'n' are to be remunerated from year 'n+2' onwards.\n\nFair value estimates reflect the assumptions of market participants based on the information available and market conditions at the estimation date, and incorporate any risk premiums related to the COVID-19 crisis. There are no significant differences between the fair value and the carrying amount at 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 and 2019 there are no significant amounts over 12 months past due\n\n(see note 19). In connection with COVID-19, no communications concerning breach of a contract in its entirety and having a significant impact on the Company have been received.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 no rights to trade receivables affected by COVID-19 and having a relevant impact on the Group have been identified, other than those detailed in note 5, although provisions recognised during the year are not significant.\n\nIn 2020, an impairment provision of Euros 423 thousand was recognised (an impairment reversal of Euros 650 thousand in 2019). Impairment of financial assets based on expected loss accumulated at 31 December 2020 amounts to Euros 1,170 thousand (Euros 747 thousand in 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020 and 2019 additions derive mainly from the annual accrual of these commitments, as well as changes in the actuarial assumptions used. These additions have been recognised as personnel expenses or finance costs, depending on their nature, and under reserves when they derive from changes in the actuarial assumptions (mainly in the case of obligations related to health insurance) or in consolidated profit or loss (in the case of past service obligations). The personnel expenses and finance costs recognised in this connection in the consolidated income statement for 2020 amount to Euros 2,014 thousand and Euros 625 thousand, respectively (Euros 1,883 thousand and Euros 606 thousand, respectively, in 2019), whilst the reserves recognised in 2020 totalled Euros 8,781 thousand (Euros 13,701 thousand in 2019).\n\nThe assumptions made with regard to 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\n|                 | 2020                  | 2019                       |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| Discount rate   | 0.87%                 | 1.05%                      |\n| Cost increase   | 3.0%                  | 3.0%                       |\n| Mortality table | PERM/F2020 1 st  rank | PERM/F 2000 new production |\n\nDetails of the effect of an increase/decrease of one percentage point in the cost of health insurance are as follows:\n\n## / Thousands of Euros /\n\n|                                                                       | 2020   | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n|                                                                       | +1 %   | -1 %     |\n| Current service cost                                                  | 621    | (449)    |\n| Interest cost of net post-employment medical costs                    | 5      | (4)      |\n| Accumulated post-employment benefit obligation   for health insurance |        |          |\n|                                                                       | 20,185 | (14,981) |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes in the consolidated Group in 2019 included the long-term incentive corresponding to 2018-2020 as a result of the business combination entailing the acquisition of HISPASAT (see note 6) .\n\nOther provisions basically include the amounts recorded by the Group every year to cover the potential unfavourable rulings relating to administrative proceedings, administrative disciplinary proceedings, judicial reviews, primarily of expropriation proceedings, and out-of-court claims, among others. The provisions recognised to cover these events are measured on the basis of the potential economic content of the ongoing appeals, litigation, claims and general legal or out-of-court proceedings to which the Group companies are party. This item also includes the provisions made to cover potential unfavourable rulings in relation to the application of the\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nremuneration model for transmission activities in Spain (see note 3) . Changes in the consolidated Group in 2019 primarily reflected provisions in relation to the fair value of the contingent liabilities identified in the HISPASAT business combination, mainly related to legal and tax contingencies in Brazil (see note 6).\n\nIn 2019, in view of the first-time application of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, Euros 4,367 thousand was reclassified to income tax payable.\n\nThe Group has assessed the risks and does not expect any events to arise that would amount to liabilities not considered in its financial statements or that would have a significant impact on its profits. At the 2020 reporting date, the Group is involved in a number of ongoing proceedings, primarily judicial reviews and disciplinary proceedings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At 31 December 2020 this item also includes Euros 22,293 thousand of revenue received in advance on account of future satellite capacity services to be rendered (Euros 10,354 thousand at 31 December 2019).\n\nThis item also includes the non-current liabilities arising from the compensation paid by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (hereinafter EDF) under the agreement signed in 1997 for the adaptation of electricity supply contracts, which amounted to Euros 23,625 thousand at 31 December 2020 (Euros 23,625 thousand at 31 December 2019). These are multi-year commitments and are therefore subject to the construction of facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18\n\n## Financial Risk Management Policy\n\nThe Group's financial risk management policy establishes principles and guidelines to ensure that any significant risks that could affect the objectives and activities of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group are identified, analysed, assessed, managed and controlled, and that these processes are carried out systematically and adhering to uniform criteria.\n\nThe Group has continued to apply the risk management policies disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated annual accounts for 2019. However, as a result of the health crisis stemming from COVID-19, a contingency plan was launched with the primary objectives of protecting employee health, guaranteeing electricity supply and connections through telecommunication assets at all times, and preserving the Group's liquidity.\n\nA summary of the main guidelines that comprise this policy is as follows:\n\n- > Risk management should be fundamentally proactive and directed towards the medium and long term, taking into account possible scenarios in an increasingly global environment.\n- > Risk should generally be managed in accordance with consistent criteria, distinguishing between the importance of the risk (probability/impact) and the investment and resources required to reduce it.\n- > Financial risk management should be focused on avoiding undesirable variations in the Group's core value, rather than generating extraordinary profits.\n\nThe Group's finance management is responsible for managing financial risk, ensuring consistency with the Group's strategy and coordinating risk management across the various Group companies, by identifying the main financial risks and defining the initiatives to be taken, based on different financial scenarios.\n\nThe methodology for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risk, as well as the management indicators and measurement and control tools specific to each risk, are implemented through the Group's Comprehensive Risk Management System, which is set forth in the Comprehensive Risk Management Policy and in the General Comprehensive Risk Management and Control Procedure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market risk specifically includes:\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate fluctuations change the fair value of assets and liabilities that accrue interest at fixed rates and the future cash flows from assets and liabilities indexed to floating interest rates. The financial debt structure at 31 December 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n\n## / Thousands of Euros /\n\n|                             | 2020       | 2020          | 2019 (*)   | 2019 (*)      |\n|-----------------------------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n|                             | Fixed rate | Variable rate | Fixed rate | Variable rate |\n| Non-current issues          | 3,756,014  | 14,940        | 2,669,621  | 14,933        |\n| Non-current bank borrowings | 1,516,216  | 1,142,618     | 1,485,771  | 1,071,444     |\n| Current issues              | 4,329      | -             | 702,898    | 215,081       |\n| Current bank borrowings     | 131,694    | 29,303        | 131,083    | 75,810        |\n| Total gross financial debt  | 5,408,253  | 1,186,860     | 4,989,373  | 1,377,267     |\n| Percentage                  | 82%        | 18%           | 78%        | 22%           |\n\n(*) Figures restated as a result of the recognition of the HISPASAT business combination, effective 3 October 2019 (see notes 2.f and 6).

Brazil, Chile and Peru, where the Group has investments, are among the countries most affected by currency devaluation. However, the US currency has been much weaker against the Euro, feeling the pinch of plummeting interest rates and the growing uncertainty as to the tempo of economic recovery.\n\nTo mitigate transaction risk, in 2020 the Group companies arranged forward cash flow hedges in the form of forward derivatives to hedge highly probable cash flows of certain revenue in US Dollars and certain payment commitments in Brazilian Reais (see note 20). Consequently, had the Euro strengthened or weakened by 10% against the hedged currencies at year-end, the market values of those\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has also arranged hedges of net investments in US Dollars through crosscurrency swaps that will be in place until January 2021 (see note 20) . Consequently, had the Euro simultaneously strengthened or weakened by 10% against the currencies to which the Group is exposed at year-end, equity attributable to the Parent would have decreased or increased by approximately Euros 32 million at 31 December 2020 (Euros 14 million at 31 December 2019).\n\n-\n\n## Price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to price risk relating to equity instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of financial position. Equity investments on quoted markets basically comprise the 5% interest held by the Group in REN. At 31 December 2020 had the listed share price of the Portuguese company REN been 10% higher or lower, equity would have increased or decreased, respectively, by approximately Euros 6 million (Euros 7 million in 2019).\n\n## b) Credit risk\n\nIn light of the nature of revenues from electricity transmission and electricity system operation, and the solvency of the electricity system agents, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's principal activities are not significantly exposed to credit risk. For the Group's other activities, credit risk is mainly managed through instruments to reduce or limit such risk.\n\nIn any event, credit risk is managed through policies that contain certain requirements regarding counterparty credit quality, and further guarantees are requested when necessary.\n\nAt year-end the Group's exposure to credit risk in connection with the fair value of its derivatives is insignificant, having entered into collateral assignment agreements entailing collateral swaps with various counterparties since 2015 in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, less than 2% of balances are past due (less than 1% in 2019), and the companies do not consider there to be any risk as regards recoverability. The credit quality of the receivables is considered to be high.\n\n## c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises due to differences between the amounts or dates of collection and payment of the Group companies' assets and liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk is mostly managed by controlling the timing of financial debt and maintaining a considerable volume of available capital during the year, setting maximum limits of amounts falling due for each period defined. This process is carried out at Group company level, in accordance\n\n<!-- image -->",

The limits established vary according to the geographical area, so as to ensure that the liquidity of the market in which the companies operate is taken into account. Furthermore, the liquidity risk management policy entails preparing cash flow projections in the main currencies in which the Group operates, taking into consideration the level of liquid assets and funds available according to these projections, and monitoring the liquidity indicators as per the consolidated statement of financial position and comparing these with market requirements.\n\nThe Group's financial debt at 31 December 2020 has an average maturity of 5.3 years (5.2 years at 31 December 2019). Details of the maturities of issues and bank borrowings are provided in note 19.\n\nThe Group has a robust financial position which has been further strengthened to tackle the COVID-19 health crisis. Liquidity has been bolstered through the issue of new bonds in 2020, amounting to Euros 1,100 million (see note 19).\n\n-\n\nThe Group's liquidity position for 2020 was based on its robust capacity to generate cash flows, supported by undrawn credit facilities. At 31 December 2020 the undrawn amount of these credit facilities is Euros 1,930 million (non-current balance of Euros 1,645 million and current balance of Euros 285 million). Following these transactions, the Group's liquidity position ensures it will be able to meet operating cash flow requirements, honour debt maturities in 2022 and 2023, and address any adverse situations that might arise in the financial markets in the coming months as a result of the current crisis. Thanks to its solid financial position, the Group has not had to request state aid to alleviate the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This interest was acquired in 2007 for Euros 98,822 thousand. In 2017 the Group subscribed 6,659,563 new shares in the share capital increase carried out by REN for an amount of Euros 12,500 thousand, thereby maintaining its 5% interest in this company.\n\nAt 31 December 2019 REN's consolidated equity totalled Euros 1,446 thousand and the profit after tax amounted to Euros 118,899 thousand.\n\nThese instruments were classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (see note 2 b). The value of this investment is subject to the listed share price (Level 1). In 2020 the fair value of this equity instrument decreased and the corresponding valuation adjustment was recognised directly under equity.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group has quantified the decrease in value of this investment at Euros 11,843 thousand (a Euros 9,541 thousand increase in 2019).\n\nIn 2020 this item also includes the investments made by the Group company Red El\u00e9ctrica de Telecomunica-ciones, Innovaci\u00f3n y Tecnolog\u00eda, S.A.U. (hereinafter RETIT) in various innovative companies, primarily the investments in Zeleros Global S.L. and Capital Call - Adara Ventures III S.C.A., which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. No gains or losses were recognised in the consolidated income statement in 2020 in relation to these investments.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDetails of derivative financial instruments are provided in note 20.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe balance at 31 December 2020 mainly comprises the loan of Euros 17,457 thousand extended to TEN (Euros 24,677 thousand at 31 December 2019), which earns interest at a Libor-pegged rate plus 270 b.p., and guarantees and loans extended by the Group to its personnel, which fall due in the long term. There are no significant differences between the fair value and the carrying amount at 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\nThis item also comprises the investment in economic interest groups (EIGs), measured at Euros 3,895 thousand (Euros 2,542 thousand in 2019). These EIGs engage in the lease of assets operated by an unrelated party, which retains most of the risks and rewards of the activity, while the Group only avails of the tax incentives pursuant to Spanish legislation. The Group recognises the tax losses incurred by these EIGs against the investments, together with the corresponding finance income (see note 24 e) reflecting the difference compared to income tax payable to the taxation authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest rate swaps consist of exchanging debt at variable interest rates for debt at fixed rates, in a swap where the future cash flows to be hedged are the interest payments. Forward interest rate swaps cover the finance cost of highly probable forecast future transactions. Similarly, cross-currency swaps allow fixed- or variable-rate debt in US Dollars to be exchanged for fixed- or variable-rate debt in Euros, thereby hedging future interest and capital flows in US Dollars. Lastly, currency forwards hedge currency risk related with highly probably forecast transactions denominated in a currency other than the Euro.\n\nAs regards the measurement of derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments disclosed in these notes, the application of IFRS 13 (see note 4 n) entails an adjustment\n\n-\n\nCONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nto the valuation techniques used to calculate the fair value of derivative financial instruments. The Group has incorporated a credit risk adjustment to reflect own and counterparty risk in the fair value of derivatives using generally accepted measurement models.\n\nTo eliminate the credit risk from the crosscurrency swaps arranged to hedge the exchange rate for USPP issuance, collateral assignment agreements entailing collateral swaps were entered into with the counterparties in 2015.\n\nWhen determining the credit risk adjustment for other derivatives, the Group applied a technique based on calculating total expected exposure (which considers current and potential exposure) through the use of simulations, adjusted for the probability of default over time and for loss given default allocable to the Group and to each counterparty.\n\nThe total expected exposure of derivative financial instruments is determined using observable market inputs, such as interest rate curves, exchange rates and volatilities based on market conditions at the measurement date.\n\nThe inputs used to determine own and counterparty credit risk (probability of default) are mostly based on own credit spreads and those of comparable companies currently traded on the market (credit default swap (CDS) curves, IRR of debt issues, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, adjustments of fair value for credit risk take into account credit enhancements for guarantees and collateral when determining the loss given default to be used for each position. Loss given default is considered to be constant over time. A minimum recovery rate of 40% has been used in cases where there is no credit enhancement for guarantees or collateral.\n\nBased on the fair value hierarchy levels detailed in note 4, the Group has considered that the majority of the inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are categorised within Level 2, including the data used to calculate the own and counterparty credit risk adjustment.\n\nThe Group has observed that the impact of using Level 3 inputs for the overall measurement of derivative financial instruments is not significant. Consequently, the Group has determined that the entire derivative financial instrument portfolio can be categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The effective tax rate in 2020 is 24.16% (24.27% in 2019).\n\nPermanent differences in 2020 and 2019 mainly arise from the capitalisation reserve adjustment resulting from the increase in equity in accordance with article 25 of Income Tax Law 27/2014 of 27 November 2014. As permitted by article 62.1 d) of Law 27/2014, the capitalisation reserve for 2020 will be appropriated by the Company (see note 14).\n\nDeductions mainly comprise those for research, development and technological innovation expenditure, as well as relief for international double taxation and donations.\n\nGiven the financial nature of the deduction for investments in fixed assets in the Canary Islands, it is treated as a grant, and its impact on the consolidated income statement is deferred over several years based on the useful lives of the assets for which it was awarded (see note 4 j).\n\n-\n\nDeductions recognised as grants in 2020 amount to Euros 4,500 thousand (Euros 3,969 thousand in 2019) and the amount still to be recognised at 31 December 2020 is Euros 113,798 thousand (Euros 106,746 thousand in 2019).\n\nCurrent receivables from and payables to public entities at 31 December 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\n## / Thousands of Euros /\n\n|                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current receivables               |        |        |\n| Recoverable VAT                   | 13,416 | 10,873 |\n| Recoverable income tax  (note 12) | 10,703 | 10,004 |\n| Other recoverable taxes           | 2,152  | 3,524  |\n| Current payables                  |        |        |\n| VAT payable  (note 20)            | 64,391 | 30,284 |\n| Income tax payable  (note 20)     | 24,961 | 23,574 |\n| Other taxes payable               | 6,071  | 6,923  |\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, adjustments were made to taxable income to reflect recognition of the EIGs in which the Group has interests, amounting to Euros 73,008 thousand and Euros 77,822 thousand, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This item also comprises amounts relating to changes in value of cash flow hedges, long-term employee benefits, asset impairment and unused tax deductions.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets amounting to Euros 10,365 thousand in respect of unused deductions for R&D&i expenditure (Euros 12,978 thousand in 2019). These assets were generated in 20112019 and are available until 2030-2038.\n\nIn 2020, the Group applied for monetisation of the unused deductions of Euros 10,565 thousand in respect of R&D expenditure. Moreover, the Group has deferred tax assets totalling Euros 8,226 thousand for R&D deductions, for which it may\n\nrequest a refund from the taxation authorities in future tax returns.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities essentially relate to the accelerated depreciation for tax purposes of certain fixed assets and the inclusion of the assets and liabilities of REDALTA and INALTA, the companies absorbed by REC in 2006. In 2020, deferred tax liabilities due to accelerated depreciation/amortisation as provided for in the 11th additional provision of Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, and the 34th transitional provision of Income Tax Law 27/2014, amounted to Euros 415,377 thousand (Euros 433,881 thousand in 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The notes to the 2008 annual accounts include disclosures on REC's contribution to REE of the branch of activities encompassing the duties of the system operator, transmission network manager and transmission agent of the Spanish electricity system.\n\nThe notes to the annual accounts of REC and REINTEL for 2015 also include the disclosures stipulated in article 86 of Law 27/2014 regarding the spin-off of the telecommunications services business from REI to REINTEL, while the notes to the annual accounts of REC and REI for 2015 contain the disclosures regarding the non-monetary contribution of shares in REN.\n\nIn accordance with current legislation, taxes cannot be considered definitive until they have been inspected and agreed by the taxation authorities or before the inspection period has elapsed.\n\nTherefore, in general, Group companies in Spain have open to inspection by the taxation authorities all main applicable taxes since 2017, except income tax, which is open to inspection since 2016. However, this period may be different for Group companies that are subject to other tax legislation.\n\n-\n\nIn Spain, the Group has certain tax proceedings ongoing in respect of income tax for 2011 to 2016, which are currently being heard either at economic-administrative level or in court proceedings. The Company considers that its conduct was lawful based on reasonable interpretations of the applicable legislation, and does not expect that any penalties will be imposed or that any significant tax liabilities will arise for the Group.\n\nIn addition, in 2020 the tax group applied for rectification of the instalments for 2016 to 2020. The Constitutional Court ruled that Royal DecreeLaw 2/2016, which approved an amendment to the instalment calculation method, among other measures, was unconstitutional.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the taxation authorities resolved the request and refunded the late payment interest related to the instalments for 2016 and 2017. The resolution delivered with respect to the remaining years has been appealed (see note 24.e).\n\nOn an international level, at the 2020 reporting date the tax proceedings entailing the review of income tax in Peru for 2009 to 2011 have concluded, finding in favour of the Group's interests.\n\nAs a result of the HISPASAT acquisition, the Group has open tax proceedings in Brazil relating to ICMS (Brazilian tax on the circulation of goods and services), as well as other taxes, mainly of an indirect nature. These proceedings stem from inspection assessments, which the Group companies have appealed. Moreover, the Group has specific guarantees to cover this contingency (see note 16).\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2021, Law 11/2020 setting the General State Budgets has introduced a limit of 95% on the exemption of dividends and capital gains arising from Spanish and foreign subsidiaries. This change has entailed the recognition of a deferred tax liability in 2020 amounting to Euros 804 thousand.\n\nDue to the different possible interpretations of tax legislation, additional tax liabilities could arise as a result of future inspections, which cannot be objectively quantified at present. Nevertheless, any additional liabilities that could eventually arise in the event of inspection are not expected to significantly affect the Company's future results.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The remuneration scheme for this position consists solely of fixed amounts, with no annual or multi-year variable remuneration and no termination benefit.\n\n-\n\nCONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nIn 2020 both remuneration components are under the same terms as in 2019.\n\nAt its meeting held on 28 January 2020, the board of directors took note of the irrevocable resignation tendered by Mr. Jordi Sevilla Segura from his position as a director, and therefore as non-executive chairman of the board of directors and of the Company.\n\nFurther, in its meeting held on 25 February 2020 the board of directors approved, inter alia, the appointment of Ms. Beatriz Corredor Sierra as a director of the Company, in the category of 'other external directors', until the next general shareholders' meeting, and her appointment as non-executive chairwoman of the board of directors and of the Company.\n\nSubsequently, at their general meeting held on 14 May 2020, the shareholders ratified the appointment of Ms. Beatriz Corredor Sierra as a director of the Company.\n\nAs regards Mr. Jordi Sevilla Segura, in accordance with his contract approved by the board of directors on 31 July 2018, he has not received any termination benefit as a result of the end of his legal and labour relations with the Company as chairman of the board of directors and of the Company.\n\nThe remuneration allocated to the CEO includes the fixed and variable annual and multi-year components corresponding to executive duties and the fixed remuneration for being a member of the board of directors. Employee benefits form part of the remuneration for this position. A portion of the annual variable remuneration is paid through the delivery of Company shares.\n\nMoreover, the CEO has been included in a defined contribution benefit scheme. This scheme covers the retirement, death and permanent disability contingencies. Red El\u00e9ctrica's obligation is limited to an annual contribution equal to 20% of the CEO's fixed annual remuneration.\n\nThe annual variable remuneration of the CEO is set by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee of the Parent at the start of each year, using predetermined quantifiable and objective criteria. The targets are in line with the strategies and actions established in the Company's Strategic Plan and the degree of fulfilment is assessed by the Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Should the employment contract be terminated, he would accrue the remuneration due at the date of suspension as an indemnity. For this purpose, his tenure at Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. up to the date he was appointed CEO (15 years), plus the period in which he rendered services - if any - following his termination as CEO, would be taken into consideration, in accordance with employment legislation in force. Both the economic regime and the suspension of the employment relationship of the new CEO are in line with those applied to the previous CEO. Following the corporatisation carried out in 2020, this obligation was taken on by Red El\u00e9ctrica Corporaci\u00f3n, S.A.\n\nIn line with standard market practices, Mr. Juan Francisco Lasala Bernad was entitled to a settlement in respect of his labour relations and an indemnity as CEO equal to one year's salary in the event that labour relations were terminated due to dismissal by the Parent or changes of control. The amount associated with his termination as CEO, which included the indemnity paid, was settled when his relationship with the Company was terminated.\n\nThe remuneration of the board of directors includes fixed annual remuneration, remuneration for attending board meetings, remuneration for work on the board of directors' committees and specific annual remuneration both for the chairs of the committees and the coordinating independent director. The components and amounts of this remuneration have not  changed in 2020.\n\nReasonable and duly supported expenses incurred as a result of their attendance at meetings and other tasks directly related to carrying out their duties, such as travel expenses, accommodation, meals and any other such costs that may be incurred, will also be paid or reimbursed to the directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its statutory activity is the study and execution of interconnections between Spain and France that will increase the electricity exchange capacity between the two countries. Decisions are taken with the unanimous consent of the parties. RTE and REE both have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of INELFE. The joint arrangement has therefore been classified as a joint operation. The Group recognises the assets, including its interest in the jointly controlled assets, and the liabilities, including its share of the liabilities that have been incurred jointly in INELFE, in its consolidated annual accounts (see note 2 d).\n\nThe Group has an interest in a joint arrangement through Red El\u00e9ctrica Chile S.P.A., which holds a 50% stake in the Chilean company TEN, alongside Engie Energ\u00eda Chile, S.A. (E.C.L. S.A.). The Group has classified this joint arrangement as a joint venture, inasmuch as the parties have rights to the net assets (see note 11).\n\nIn 2020, the Group also had a stake - through Red El\u00e9ctrica Brasil Holding Ltda., which holds a 50% interest alongside Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1 S.A E.S.P. - in the Brazilian company Argo Energia Emprendimientos y Participaciones S.A. (Argo), which in turn owns Argo Transmisi\u00f3n de Energia S.A. ('Argo I'), Argo II Transmisi\u00f3n de Energia S.A. ('Argo II') and Argo III Transmisi\u00f3n de Energia S.A. ('Argo III'). The Group has likewise classified this joint arrangement as a joint venture, inasmuch as the parties have rights to the net assets (see note 11).\n\nDue to the existence of contractual arrangements under which decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of both parties, the Group has joint control of several 'UTEs' (Uni\u00f3n Temporal de Empresas - a form of temporary business association). The Group has classified the investments as joint operations because the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. The UTE has been formed to provide dark fibre services, with an availability guarantee, between the Balearic Islands and the Mediterranean Coast of the Spanish mainland.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group companies received no significant environment-related grants in 2020 or 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These three essentially technical committees created by the board of directors to support it in its duties are designed to enhance efficiency and transparency.\n\nThe structure, composition, roles and responsibilities of the committees (legal committees) are specified in articles 22 to 24 of the articles of association and are implemented in articles 14 to 18 TER of the regulations of the board of directors. Both sets of corporate regulations have been fully brought into line with the latest reforms of the Spanish Companies Act,\n\nthe Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the most up-to-date international practices and recommendations on committee composition and committee member independence and qualifications. At the board meeting held on 19 February 2019, the directors approved an amendment to the regulations of the board of directors through the restructuring of the board committees, specifically by creating a new Sustainability Committee and updating the duties of the other two board committees, i.e. the Audit Committee and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. Among other amendments, the responsibilities of this latter committee were reinforced by creating a new relationship framework between the board\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CEO was also tasked with conveying information to the media, investors and shareholders.\n- > The chair of the Audit Committee temporarily assumed the oversight of the internal audit and risk control functions.\n- > The process to appoint a new chairman/woman was set in motion. This person was to be appointed by the board of directors, convened by the coordinating independent director, on the basis of a favourable report received from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most notably, its principal activities comprise the management and operation of electricity infrastructure in Spain, Peru, Chile and Brazil, and the rendering of telecommunications services (fibre optics and satellites) to third parties.\n\n## Management and operation of domestic electricity infrastructure\n\nThe mission of REE, as transmission agent and system operator for the Spanish electricity system, is that of guaranteeing the security and continuity of the electricity supply at all times and managing high voltage electricity transmission. To this end, it oversees and coordinates the generation and transmission system and manages the development of the transmission network. The Company seeks to fulfil its mission while adhering to the principles of neutrality, transparency, independence and economic efficiency, so as to offer a secure, efficient and high-quality electricity service to society as a whole.\n\nThe Group has executed its Investment Plan in Spain, entailing investments in the transmission network, as per the 2015-2020 Planning.\n\nA new remuneration model for the 2020-2025 regulatory period was approved in 2019.\n\nInvestments in transmission network facilities in 2020 totalled Euros 383.1 million and were basically to address security of supply issues, to resolve technical restrictions, to execute specific projects for international interconnections and inter-island submarine connections, to supply the high-speed rail system and to provide access for the evacuation of wind power.\n\nDuring the year, approximately 116 km of new lines came into service, bringing the total transmission network in terms of domestic electricity infrastructure to 44,468 km. Transformation capacity was also increased by 1,080 MVA to a total of 93,545 MVA.\n\nIn 2020 the most significant initiatives in terms of development of the transmission network, by major axes, were as follows:\n\n- > Mallorca - Menorca interconnection 2. 132 kV underground - submarine transmission line to interconnect the islands of Mallorca and Menorca and to integrate renewable energy. The entire axis entered service in 2020.\n- > Caparacena - Baza - Ribina Axis. The purpose of this axis is to facilitate the evacuation of energy from the ordinary regime, renewable sources, co-generation and waste, as well as to improve\n\nthe transmission network mesh and support distribution in the province of Granada.\n\n- > Leones Axis The purpose of this axis is to bolster the 220 kV mesh in the area surrounding Zaragoza, to improve the stability of the electricity system and to guarantee distribution supply.\n- > North - East Axis. The purpose of this axis is to improve the evacuation of electricity from Asturias to supply Cantabria and the Basque Country. The initiatives in progress are the expansion of the Itxaso substation and the G\u00fce\u00f1es - Itxaso line.\n- > Beniferri - La Eliana Axis. The purpose of this axis is to reduce the intensity of the short circuit current in Valencia and expand the network mesh, improving transmission efficiency and supporting supply for demand in adjacent nodes. Part of this axis entered service in 2020, specifically the expansion of the Beniferri substation.\n- > Oriol Axis. The purpose of this axis is to guarantee the electricity supply, support distribution, and resolve technical restrictions in Caceres. The axis is related to the Navalmoral\n- - Badajoz high-speed rail line, which forms part of the connection envisaged between Madrid and Lisbon.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The purpose of this axis is to increase the security of supply and transmission network reliability in the Santa Cruz de Tenerife metropolitan area, as well as to make the transmission grid more robust and reduce its vulnerabilities to incidents.\n- > Lanzarote - Fuerteventura Interconnection. This axis involves the laying of a 132 kV under-ground-submarine transmission line to interconnect the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, thus strengthening the interisland transmission grid.\n- > Lousame - Tibo - Mazaricos Axis. The purpose of this axis is to reinforce the network, evacuate electricity generated, and support distribution in the northeast of Galicia. Part of this axis entered service in 2019 (the Mazaricos and Lousame substations and the Lousame 220 kV input/output line). Construction of the Lousame-Mazaricos line continued in 2020.\n- > T\u00edas - Playa Blanca Axis. The purpose of this axis is to guarantee electricity supply in the south of Lanzarote and to reinforce the connection with Fuerteventura. These measures, together with the 132 kV submarine cable interconnecting Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, will increase security of supply in the Lanzarote electricity system. Part of this axis came into service in 2020, specifically the T\u00edas 132/66 kV substation and the\n\nassociated T\u00edas input/output line of the 66kV M\u00e1cher-Punta Grande line.\n\nThe most notable occurrences in 2020 in terms of electricity system operation were as follows:\n\n## Mainland system\n\n- > Mainland electricity demand closed the year at 236,525 GWh, down 5.1% on 2019, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed down economic activity. This decline in some cases was by up to 20% with respect to equivalent periods in the previous year. Having corrected for the effect of working patterns and temperatures, demand attributable primarily to economic activity was also down by 5.1%.\n- > Maximum instantaneous power was recorded on Wednesday 22 January at 20:22 hours, at a rate of 40,423 MW. This is down 0.1% on the maximum for the prior year, and down 11.1% compared with the record 45,450 MW documented on 17 December 2007. Peak demand in terms of time was posted on 20 January (between 20:00 and 21:00 hours) at 39,997 MWh, 10.9% below the all-time high obtained in 2007.\n- > Installed capacity on the mainland has risen slightly compared to the prior year, ending 2020 at 105,224 MW, which is 229 MW more than at December 2019 (up 0.2%). In terms of additions, the increase was driven by the incorporation\n\nof solar photovoltaic and wind power to the system's installed capacity, with the former increasing by 30% with respect to the prior year, while the latter posted year-on-year growth of 5.4%. On the decommissioning side, there was a sharp drop in coal-fired installed capacity in the wake of the closure of various electrical generators that supplied a total of 3,723 MW. The capacity of other technologies either did not vary or changed only insignificantly.\n\n- > Hydropower capacity stood at 30,512 GWh at the end of December 2020, up 2.6% on the historical average and 17.4% higher than in 2019. Reserves of hydroelectric power represented a fill level of 50.8% of total capacity across all reservoirs at the end of 2020, compared with 51.0% in the prior year.\n- > In 2020, 23.3% of demand was met by nuclear technology (22.6% in 2019), 22.5% by wind power (21.5% in 2019), 16.0% by combined cycle generation (20.7% in 2019), 12.8% by hydroelectric power (10.0% in 2019) and 11.2% by cogeneration (12.0% in 2019). With a contribution of less than 10%, coal, solar technologies, other renewable sources, waste and pump-as-turbine jointly covered the remaining 14.2% of demand.\n- > Renewable energy's percentage contribution to total energy generation in the electricity system rose to 45.5% (38.9% in 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Per individual system, demand declined by 19.2% in the Balearic Islands and by 10.5% in the Canary Islands, dropping by 3.3% in Ceuta and 1.4% in Melilla.\n- > The installed capacity of the non-mainland systems slid by 3.5%, due primarily to the closure of two coal-fired generators in the Balearic Islands, which led to a drop of 227 MW.\n\nPursuant to Law 17/2013 the Group, through REE, is tasked with developing hydroelectric pumping power plants in the Canary Islands, geared towards security of supply, system security and the integration of unmanageable renewable energies.\n\nRed El\u00e9ctrica Infraestructuras en Canarias, S.A.U. (hereinafter REINCAN) is, in turn, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group company responsible for executing the development of those hydroelectric pumping power plants in the Canary Islands.\n\nThe feedback received during the public consultation stage of the project submitted in 2019 (Modified Project I), primarily the request to bury the 220 kV DC line that evacuates power from the generating plant, led Red El\u00e9ctrica to\n\npresent a new project for submission (Modified Project II).\n\nModified Project II was prepared during the first half of 2020, as was the new associated environmental impact study. They were both submitted on 13 July 2020 to set the administrative procedure in motion once again. The public information and consultation process was completed in the second half of 2020, with all objections and queries duly answered in a timely manner. The file was then submitted for assessment by the environmental authorities on 14 December with a view to obtaining the pertinent Environmental Impact Statement.\n\nMajor headway was also made as regards the requirements for goods and services. The tender process for the Seawater Desalination Plant ('EDAM' per the Spanish acronym) was launched and the consultation phase with bidders in now underway. Progress was also made on adapting the main contracts (equipment and civil engineering works) with a view to these being put out for tender in 2021.\n\nWith respect to the possible project to establish a hydroelectric pumping plant in Tenerife, work continued in 2020 to find a suitable location and on possible design configurations, to which end preliminary implementation and feasibility studies were carried out.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, in 2020 this company completed all of the necessary tasks to develop and implement the special projects undertaken by REDESUR, and also engaged in work for TESUR 3 and TESUR 4. REA also carries out facilities maintenance and supervises works for other clients, strengthening its position in southern Peru as a leading provider of such services.\n\n## Activity in Chile\n\nThe transmission business in Chile comes under the umbrella of the parent company in that country, Red El\u00e9ctrica Chile (RECH). This company was incorporated by REI in 2015 and its principal activities comprise the acquisition, holding and management of the Group's equity investments in Chile, and the provision of commercial advisory, financial and business services to the Group's investees. RECH holds a 50% interest in Transmisora El\u00e9ctrica del Norte (TEN), a 69.9% interest in Red El\u00e9ctrica del Norte (REDENOR) and 100% of Red El\u00e9ctrica del Norte 2 (REDENOR 2).\n\nTEN constructed and operates the 500 kV Changos - Cumbre - Nueva Cardones axis, which forms part of the National Transmission System, as well as the 220 kV Mejillones - Changos dedicated line. Completion of the 500 kV axis enabled the creation of the National Transmission System in 2017, through the interconnection of the systems existing at that time, namely the Central Interconnected System ('SIC') and the Far North Interconnection System ('SING'). In 2020, TEN completed its third full year of commercial operation, and with a high availability factor for its facilities (99.70%), on a par with prior years' availability.\n\nREDENOR has continued its construction of the transmission facilities in northern Chile, awarded in 2017. In 2020 the first stage of the project entered service (Nuevo Pozo Almonte 220 kV substation, Stage 1 of the project). At the 2020 year-end the availability of the facilities stood at 100%. REDENOR has also forged ahead with Stage 2 of the project, which involves the construction of 258 km of 220 kV power lines to the Pozo Almonte, C\u00f3ndores and Parinacota substations, which is scheduled for completion in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is also immersed in the extension works of its facilities encompassed in the Transmission System Expansion Plan, entailing the construction of the new Centinela 220 kV substation.\n\n## Activity in Brazil\n\nOn 25 March 2020, Red El\u00e9ctrica, through its subsidiary Red El\u00e9ctrica Brasil (REB), and Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1 (GEB) acquired 50% of the Brazilian holding company Argo, which in turn owns the Argo I, Argo II and Argo III concessions. This acquisition enabled Red El\u00e9ctrica to kick off operations in Brazil where it jointly manages, with GEB, three 30-year concessions encompassing high-voltage power lines (500 kV and 230 kV) spanning a total of 1,430 km and 11 electricity substations.\n\nArgo I operates 1,110 km of 500 kV power lines and five substations in the northeast of Brazil. It constitutes 80% of Argo's revenues and has been in service since the end of 2019. The availability of the Transmission System in 2020 stands at 99.34%.\n\nArgo II is executing a project to expand a substation that is currently under construction in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nArgo III operates 320 km of 230 kV power lines and three substations in the State of Rondonia (the facilities came into commercial service between the end of May and mid-July 2020 and represent 87% of revenues; it has a Transmission System availability in 2020 of 98.79%). The expansion of a further two substations in this Brazilian State is currently under construction.\n\n## Telecommunications\n\n## Satellite business\n\nOn 3 October 2019, once the conditions precedent for the contract signed on 12 February 2019 had been met, Red El\u00e9ctrica Sistemas de Telecomunicaciones, S.A. (RESTEL) acquired 89.68% of the shares of the HISPASAT Subgroup (hereinafter HISPASAT). The other HISPASAT shareholders are SEPI, with a 7.41% interest, and the CDTI, which holds 2.91%.\n\nHISPASAT is the leading satellite infrastructure operator in Spain and Portugal by volume of business, and also ranks as the fourth operator in Latin America and the eighth operator worldwide. It is the leading distributor of content in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nHISPASAT's principal activity consists of leasing spatial capacity and providing broadband managed services, through the operation and commercial exploitation of its fleet of satellites in orbit and the related ground segment. These activities are conducted through the Subgroup's parent, HISPASAT, S.A., which operates and commercialises the Subgroup's satellites that are not located in orbit over Brazilian territory, and through Hispasat Canarias, S.L., Sociedad Unipersonal, Hispamar Sat\u00e9lites, S.A., Hispamar Exterior, S.L., Sociedad Unipersonal, and Hispasat M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V., which jointly operate and commercialise the satellites that are in orbit over Brazilian territory.

The sizeable supply of capacity, coupled with the expansive roll-out of terrestrial networks (fibre and 4G) in certain regions, have continued to put downward pressure on spatial capacity prices. Likewise, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted demand, especially in the second half of the year. The pandemic has not only primarily affected the mobility market due to the drastic decline in travel, but also other market segments, such as government-backed connectivity projects (whose roll-outs have been hit by significant delays) and DTH and audiovisual activities due to the reduced number of sporting fixtures and cultural events.\n\nMoreover, 2020 also saw the consolidation of certain trends that had already surfaced in the market, such as the verticalisation of certain satellite operators, which are increasingly taking on the role of service providers in some segments and/or geographical areas. This trend also affected HISPASAT. In addition to pressing ahead with the development of value-added solutions and services, it has also positioned itself as a provider of turnkey solutions, especially\n\n-\n\nin the mobile backhaul segment for telcos, netting a major contract in Mexico to connect over 700 base stations with a data consumption rate in excess of 4 Gbps.\n\nIn view of the situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformation process in which the satellite sector is immersed, the renegotiation of prices and contract cancellations, the evolution of government projects and the worsening US Dollar and Brazilian Reais forex environment, HISPASAT embarked upon a strategic rethink, which led to the approval of a new 2021-2025 Strategic Plan at the end of 2020. The new strategy aims to reposition HISPASAT and shift it from an infrastructure operator to a provider of satellite services.\n\n## Fibre optics business\n\nThe Group's telecommunications business primarily operates in Spain, doing so through the subsidiary Red El\u00e9ctrica Infraestructuras de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, S.A.U. (hereinafter REINTEL).\n\nREINTEL is the Group company responsible for operating telecommunications networks and rendering telecommunications services to third parties.\n\nREINTEL is a neutral provider of telecommunications infrastructure. Its principal activity is leasing dark fibre and associated infrastructure. REINTEL also provides\n\nmaintenance services for fibre optic cables and telecommunications equipment. At present, the company operates a fibre optic network in excess of 50,600 km rolled out over the electricity transmission grid and the railway network, guaranteeing transparent access on equal terms to its customers and to telecommunications sector players.\n\nREINTEL has been awarded, for a period of 20 years until November 2034, the rights to use and operate the fibre optic network not used for railway services, and the related infrastructure, owned by Adif-Alta Velocidad.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Business performance\n\n## 2.1 Key financial indicators\n\nRevenues in 2020 stood at Euros 1,985.8 million, which reflects the decline in transmission income in Spain following the application of new remuneration parameters. This effect was partially offset by greater revenues from the operation of the system in Spain given the entry into force of Circular 4/2019, and the increase in telecommunications activity, thanks to the incorporation of HISPASAT, which contributed Euros 155 million during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This amount includes Euros 118.8 million contributed by HISPASAT. EBITDA also includes the results of ownership interests held in investees, such as the 50% held in electricity transmission companies TEN (Chile) and Argo (Brazil), in a total amount of Euros 25.3 million.\n\nOperating expenses were as follows:\n\n- > Supplies and other operating expenses amounted to Euros 344.2 million, down 1.9% on the previous year despite including the expenses of Euros 25 million corresponding to HISPASAT. The figure for 2019 only included the expenses of this company for the last quarter.\n- > The year-end headcount was 2,051 employees, down 5 on the 2019 year-end and including 199 HISPASAT workers. The average headcount was 2,041 employees, up 184 on 2019, which reflects the Group's incorporation of HISPASAT in its figures for the entire year.\n\nPersonnel expenses are therefore up 9.9% on the prior year. This growth would have been 1.9% were it not for HISPASAT-related expenses.\n\nEBIT amounted to Euros 929.0 million, down 14.2% in 2019. This decline is largely due to the impairment of HISPASAT assets amounting to Euros 122.3 million. EBIT would have dropped by 2.9% were it not for this impact.\n\nThe net finance cost amounted to Euros 123.0 million, an improvement of Euros 9.9 million compared with the prior year. The average gross financial debt totalled Euros 6,953 million, up by Euros 1,017 million on the previous year; this increase in debt was offset by lower average borrowing costs, which slid from 2.29% in 2019 to 1.74% in 2020.\n\nLastly, profit for the year totalled Euros 621.2 million, down 13.1% on the same period of the previous year. In recurring terms, net profit would have stood at Euros 703.0 million, i.e. down 1.8% on 2019, had it not been for the HISPASAT-related impairment provision. The tax rate stood at 24.2%.\n\nOperating cash flows after tax stood at Euros 1,232.2 million, reflecting a decline of 2.1% with respect to the prior year. The 15.2% drop in profit before tax was largely offset by the 23.0% rise in depreciation and amortisation, impairment and other adjustments.\n\nWorking capital at 31 December 2020 stood at Euros 173.5 million, in stark contrast to the negative figure of Euros 211.6 million in the prior\n\nyear. This rise in working capital is mainly due to the positive changes recorded in amounts collected from electricity system payments.\n\nThe Group's investments during the year amounted to Euros 895.0 million. Euros 383.1 million of this amount were used to develop the national transmission network. Moreover, Euros 417.5 million were channelled into developing the international electricity transmission business, of which Euros 374.3 million went to the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Brazilian business Argo. Lastly, Euros 60.1 million were channelled into the development of the telecommunications business, Euros 16.8 million to operation of the system and the rest to other projects, including most notably the Euros 4.1 million invested by Elewit, the Group's technology subsidiary.\n\nDividends paid with a charge to the prior year's profit totalled Euros 566.8 million, equivalent to Euros 1.0519 per share.\n\nNet financial debt stood at Euros 6,113.3 million at 31 December, up 1.2% on the Euros 6,038.1 million at the 2019 year-end.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, all of the Group's financial debt is non-current. In terms of interest, 82% of the Group's debt is fixed-rate and the remaining 18% is variable-rate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The activities conducted by the Group are very capital-intensive, wherein a major portion of investments mature over extensive periods. In addition, these assets are remunerated over long periods of time, meaning that financial debt is primarily long-term and fixed-rate. The Group's strategic commitment to long-term, enterprise-wide sustainability is also present in its responsible and transparent management style, which promotes sustainable sources of financing.\n\nThe Group's capital structure policy ensures a financial structure that optimises the cost of capital through a sound financial position, which balances the generation of value for shareholders with competitive costs of financing. Capital is periodically monitored through the gearing ratio, which in 2020 stood at 63.7%, compared to 62.7% in 2019. This ratio is calculated as net financial debt divided by equity plus net financial debt.\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo maintain and adjust the capital structure, the Company can adjust the amount of dividends payable to shareholders, reimburse capital or issue shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group has implemented a Comprehensive Risk Management System, which aims to ensure that any risks that might affect its strategies and objectives are systematically identified, analysed, assessed, managed and controlled, according to uniform criteria and within the established risk levels, in order to facilitate compliance with the strategies and objectives of the Group. The Comprehensive Risk Management Policy was approved by the board of directors of the Parent company of the Group. This Comprehensive Risk Management System, the Policy and the General Procedure regulating it are based on the COSO ERM 2017 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework.\n\nThe risk management system is implemented in accordance with ISO 31000 on risk management principles and guidelines, which is comprehensive and ongoing in nature. Risk management is also strengthened at the business unit, subsidiary, support area and corporate level.\n\nThe comprehensive risk management and control policy and procedure define the various duties of the governing bodies and those of each organisational unit, as well as the information\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such plans will include specific objectives and responsibilities.\n\n## Identification and quantification of risks and opportunities\n\nClimate change risks and opportunities comprise both physical risks and opportunities related to changes in climate variables (which could directly affect the facilities or impact the services rendered by the Group) and transition risks and opportunities (related to changes stemming from the fight against climate change: regulatory, technological, market and reputational).\n\nThe risks and opportunities have been identified and assessed considering different scenarios:\n\n- > For physical risks, AEMET's projections for the most important scenarios of the IPCC AR55 (1) (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) have been considered.\n\n- > The regulatory and transition scenarios are based on the proposed National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan sent to the European Commission, having considered the trend scenario and the target scenario.\n\nThe transition risks and opportunities analysis focuses on the 2020-2030 horizon, while the physical risks and opportunities analysis focuses on a longer time frame (2030-2050-2070). The economic impact has been quantified for a period of ten years in both cases.\n\nThe risks and opportunities identified are assessed considering variables such as exposure, sensitivity and capacity to adapt. They can thus be prioritised based on their importance.\n\nSignificant risks and opportunities are scrutinised in order to quantify the Group's exposure based on economic variables and/or business indicators.\n\nThe process to identify and quantify risks and opportunities is reviewed and updated at least annually.\n\n## Conclusions: risks and opportunities\n\nHigh-priority risks are as follows:\n\n## Physical:\n\n- > Impact of extreme events (wind) on outdoor facilities (power lines).\n- > Fires beneath the lines and near substations.\n\nThe economic impact of physical risks is reduced considerably by insurance policies. The estimated annual impact is no more than 2% of the Group's profit.\n\n## Transition:\n\n- > Stricter legal requirements related to the use of fluorinated gases (SF6).\n- > Claims due to limitations on renewable energy production and incidents that may affect the security of supply in the Canary Islands.\n- > Difficulties in bringing into service the necessary infrastructure for the energy transition (this risk is identified and analysed specifically for international interconnections).\n\nThe latter has been identified as the most significant climate change transition risk for the Group. In order to meet the objectives of the energy transition, the transmission network must be developed, mainly in respect of the evacuation and integration of renewable power generation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investment opportunities have been identified in the transmission network (lines and substations), storage and other technical solutions to address the energy transition challenges (protection systems, FACTS equipment, and other control and monitoring equipment).\n\nTo a lesser extent, the Group's improved performance in respect of mitigating and adapting to climate change could be a boon for its reputation, leading to better financing opportunities or higher stock prices.\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 Average supplier payment period. \"Reporting Requirement\".

To this end, the Group will: continue to develop the role of the Spanish TSO, helping to make the energy transition a reality in Spain; continue to foster connectivity as a leading operator of both fibre optic and satellite telecommunications infrastructure; consolidate its international business; and invest in technological acceleration and innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The traditional business, based on the wholesale lease of satellite capacity, especially for video services, is now a highly mature segment. Most satellite operators are now shifting towards the provision of data transmission services, such as extending telecommunication networks or connectivity in the mobility sector, which offer better growth prospects. This shift in focus goes hand in hand with more vertical business models, where the provision of higher value-added services is proving to be the springboard strategy to harness the new growth trends in the market.\n\nHISPASAT approved a new 2021-2025 Strategic Plan at the end of 2020.  Aligned with the market forecast for the coming years, this plan is based on shifting HISPASAT's commercial activity away from the traditional business in an orderly and measured fashion, while gradually and simultaneously bringing on board a new focus and direction towards vertical business models with greater future growth potential. The lines of action laid down in the plan include the following:\n\n- > Protection of the core businesses, such as the provision of video distribution services, through steps designed to enhance efficiencies, strengthen relationships with key customers and extend the maturity period of satellite television.\n- > Positioning HISPASAT as the turn-to player on the Iberian Peninsula for the provision of connectivity services via satellite in residential and professional contexts, as well as for the provision of services to public authorities. This line of action implies a gradual verticalisation of HISPASAT across the value chain and the implementation of new integrated operational and business models capable of setting it apart from the competition.\n- > Investment in new satellite infrastructure to participate in the forecast growth in the air, maritime and land-based mobility market.\n- > Development of capacities for new nascent business niches, such as the Internet of Things in rural areas or the expansion of 5G connectivity.\n\nOver the course of 2020, HISPASAT had to rise to the challenge posed by COVID-19, which impacted the provision of services via satellite, as it did other sectors of the economy, especially in the second half of the year.\n\nIn addition, the telecommunications activities carried out by REINTEL, as a provider of telecommunications infrastructure, will focus on the backbone fibre network market, specifically the lease of dark fibre in the infrastructure associated with telecommunications sector players. To this end, REINTEL will continue to implement its commercial plan and undertake the investments requested by customers, as well as broadening its portfolio of fibre products, in order to generate greater revenues.\n\nFurthermore, REINTEL will keep making progress on interconnecting rail and electrical fibre networks with the aim of offering new solutions to customers, such as new redundant sources and access points, whilst continuing to uphold the high standard of service quality offered to its customers.\n\nAs regards innovation, RETIT will help the Group to capitalise on its commitment to innovative initiatives, entrepreneurship and technological development, which are the cornerstones of sustainability against a changing backdrop in both the energy and telco sectors.\n\nThrough RETIT, the Group will harness the potential of technology to further the Group's business and activity, as well as to explore new value-added business segments. Initiatives focused on new tech niches will be explored, such as cybersecurity, energy, AI and advanced\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first few months saw a continuation of the prior year's trends. However, by the end of the first quarter of 2020 equity markets were shaken by the pandemic, causing them to retrace to levels from several years earlier. The expansionary monetary policies implemented with greater intensity by the main central banks, the announcements of strong support for economic recovery through the creation of new incentives and an increase in public spending have since made a gradual recovery of stock market indices possible.\n\nThis recovery has enabled Wall Street to end the year on a positive note, with its main indices setting new all-time highs in the final days of 2020. Most notable is the 43.6% rise in the Nasdaq. Conversely, leading European markets have closed the year in the red. Most notable are the drops in the UK FTSE and the Spanish IBEX. The 14.3% slide in the former was possibly as a result of Brexit-related uncertainty. Spain's selective index saw the biggest drop of the major European stock markets after losing 15.5% in the year, reflecting the serious effects of the pandemic on our economy, which is highly dependent on the services sector and especially on tourism. The exception among the European indices was the German DAX, which gained 3.5% for the year as a whole and also ended the year at record highs. In the Asian stock markets, most notable is the Japanese Nikkei, which gained more than 15%.\n\nIn addition to this performance by geographical location, there was a clear differentiation by sector in 2020. Stocks related to the technology and pharmaceutical sectors and companies linked to renewable energies have been favoured by investors. Conversely, sectors such as finance, oil and gas suffered severe setbacks during the year.\n\nRed El\u00e9ctrica's shares performed similarly to the Spanish stock market throughout 2020, although their decline in the year was less pronounced. The share hit its annual high in the first weeks of the year, reaching Euros 19.74 on 19 February. Its low point occurred in mid-March, coinciding with the major market backslide, which pushed the share down to its minimum for the year of Euros 13.105 on 12 March. The closing price was Euros 16.775, representing a 6.4% decline in 2020 as a whole.\n\nA total of 535.1 million shares were traded on the Madrid Stock Exchange during the year as a whole, which is 1% more than in the previous year and equivalent to 99% of the company's shares. The total volume traded on the spot market was Euros 8,882.3 million, down 9% on 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018 stipulates that the Group's subsidiaries are not required to prepare a NFIS as their information is included in the Group's Consolidated NFIS.\n\nAdditionally, we must point out that, following the Non-Financial Information Statement, Red El\u00e9ctrica Group issues a Sustainability Report that supplements the previous document and which is likewise subject to external auditing.\n\n## Materiality Study\n\nIn 2019, with a view to advancing the 2030 Sustainability Commitment, the Group updated its Materiality Study in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards for the purpose of identifying relevant issues.\n\nThe Materiality Study is based on an analysis of the Group's sustainability context in order to build an overall picture of the environment in which the organisation operates. This then allows the Group to review sustainability planning for the 2019-2022 period. To define the context, the\n\nGroup considers all the business activities and the geographical areas where it operates.\n\nThe sustainability context includes: a trend analysis that defines and/or will define the overall sustainability, industry and geographical framework in which the Group carries out its activity; the identification of good practices to ascertain the level of maturity of the Group's sustainability performance with respect to comparable benchmark companies; and an analysis of internal data to identify the requirements and expectations of stakeholders and other issues of relevance with a view to their incorporation in the commitments and corporate planning. Please note that the Group's stakeholders were involved in this study in order to gauge their requirements and expectations. In this respect, strategic interviews were conducted with Group management, key technical personnel and representatives of external stakeholders in order to collect knowledge on the challenges, risks and opportunities regarding sustainability from both an internal and external perspective. Specifically, representatives of the following stakeholder groups were involved in the 2019 analysis of the sustainability context: business partners, suppliers, technology research and development centres, social agents and associations, environmental groups, consumer associations and end consumers, rating agencies, the media, industry associations, professional and business\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to prioritise issues, an internal and external assessment of the criticality of the identified issues for the achievement of long-term objectives, and thus for long-term continuity, was carried out. The prioritisation matrix provides a dual analysis of the issues, revealing both their internal importance, assigned by the top-level managers and key technical personnel who took part in the analysis of the sustainability context, and their external importance, based on the value assigned by the external stakeholders who were consulted. Linking the prioritisation of issues with the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is absolutely fundamental.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business model of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has not necessitated a review of the materiality study results, although it is clear that management of certain issues, especially 'Safety, health and well-being' and 'Digital Transformation', includes new aspects.\n\n-\n\n## Relevant issue prioritisation matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To this end, ensuring the health and safety of employees and guaranteeing the proper functioning of the electricity system in Spain, as well as that of the electricity, telecom and satellite infrastructure in the countries where it operates, are the primary concerns of the Group during this pandemic.\n\n## Ensuring security of supply and the proper functioning of our infrastructure\n\nThe Group and more specifically REE, as the electricity transmission infrastructure owner and system manager, has remained fully committed to achieving the targets defined by the Spanish authorities, having implemented a number of extraordinary measures in order to meet its obligations as laid down in Law 24/2013, aimed at ensuring continuity and security of supply. These measures have been executed in parallel with the priority of guaranteeing the health of the Company's employees and observing the health authorities' policy to slow the spread.\n\nElectricity demand fell by 8% in the first six months of the year with respect to the prior year. Specifically, it fell by 13.3% during the state of emergency in Spain from 15 March 2020 to 21 June 2020. Despite this anomalous situation,\n\nREE guaranteed the electricity supply to all households and essential services across the country at all times.\n\nThe scenario triggered by COVID-19 has not hindered the progress of the energy transition. Renewables were up by 10.3% in terms of GWh output in the first four months of 2020 with respect to the same period in 2019. In fact, renewables accounted for 47.3% of the entire electricity generation mix at the April 2020 close. The boom in renewables, together with the 11.8% decline in electricity generation with respect to the same month in 2019, made April the cleanest month in terms of greenhouse gas emissions: equivalent to 2,154,465.2 tCO2, almost halving the level of ten years ago.\n\nIn order to bolster security of supply even further, the company brought a third control centre into service. Like the first two, it operates entirely autonomously and is manned by independent teams working around the clock, seven days a week.\n\nAdditional prevention measures were also implemented for staff operating the Telecommunications Supervision Centre and the Facilities Maintenance Centre, as well as for professional teams on-call to respond to possible incidents on the grid.\n\nThe development of new electricity transmission and telecommunications infrastructure experienced temporary delays, due to the total or partial stoppage of economic activities imposed by the authorities. These activities resumed in part in the closing months of the year. The impact on the Group as a whole amounts to 5% of the initially envisaged volume of investment. This impact is mainly concentrated in transmission network development in Spain, although Chile has likewise seen delays in the development of the new HISPASAT Amazonas Nexus satellite.\n\nIn international business, despite the decline in demand for electricity in Peru and Chile, security of supply has been guaranteed since operations remained ongoing as an essential service through the following activities:\n\n- > Contingency Plan to respond to COVID-19 consisting of four execution phases. The contingency plan had to be adapted to the legislative changes in the country.\n- > ManTop project, which ensured a response at substations, made up of local operations and maintenance personnel.\n- > 'Essential Activities COVID-19' programme, which set out the minimum and vital tasks that had to be undertaken at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Red El\u00e9ctrica has followed guidelines that have been adapted to the recommendations issued by the various pertinent authorities in Spain, as well as in each market of operations; the priority in all cases was to safeguard the health and safety of all of its employees:\n\n- > Working from home was implemented for all Group employees whose duties allowed for it. This encompasses 80% of the workforce in Spain and in Latin America. The remaining 20% work on-site at the electricity and telecommunications control centres where the Group operates and at the worksites that respond to the various needs of the grid.\n- > All people in high-risk groups continue to work from home. These include people who are vulnerable to COVID-19, people over 60 years old, those who share their home with a pregnant woman or family members that work in the healthcare field, as well as those coming to work by public transport.\n- > Office-based work resumed in September in Spain and later in Peru and Chile, albeit in the mornings only, and with the following measures in place:\n- \u2202 Antibody tests for all employees.\n- \u2202 Mandatory use of masks throughout the working day, even when safe distancing of 2 metres can be respected.\n- \u2202 A rotating shift pattern to ensure 2-metre safe distancing between staff at the office.\n- \u2202 Provision of protective equipment for all employees, including surgical masks, hand sanitiser gel and gloves.\n- \u2202 All meetings still have to be conducted online, even though attendees may physically be at the office.\n- \u2202 Suspension of services such as the staff canteen, vending machines, physiotherapy, and sporting and volunteering activities that require a physical presence.\n- \u2202 Restrictions on international travel, except where deemed absolutely essential and only after approval from the area head.\n\n## Strengthening the commitment to digitalisation\n\nThe digital transformation of the company has been ongoing for some time now. For example, infrastructure is now widely in place to allow staff that need to work from home to do so. The spotlight has also remained squarely focused on cybersecurity, through strengthening the security measures already in place to protect equipment and to roll out remote access. This has all contributed to the following:\n\n- > Over 2,100 users connected (employees and associates) at any given time via VPN (Virtual Private Network).\n- > Over 3,125 active channels on shared working platforms.\n- > Over 40,000 virtual meetings held.\n- > Over 10,000 incidents, requests and queries resolved remotely.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Activities carried out in this regard include the following:\n\n- > The Group has joined the Cruz Roja Responde initiative to help cover the basic needs of 25,000 families at risk of poverty and social exclusion, especially to cover their needs in terms of food and companionship.\n- > Backing for rural environments through the following initiatives:\n- \u2202 #Alimentos\\_Solidarios alongside the Federation of Rural Women's Associations (FADEMUR per its Spanish acronym), which consists of buying food from 70 family-run farms in rural areas for distribution to social organisations to cover the basic needs of families at risk of exclusion. A total of 135,300 basic food parcels have been donated.\n- \u2202 'Huerta Pr\u00f3xima\", which has fostered cooperation among more than 300 smallholder farmers across Spain, providing access to local markets for their products.\n- > Financial assistance for the production of healthcare material:\n- \u2202 Open Ventilator pilot project to design a ventilator accredited by the Ministry of Health; the initiative is promoted by the Celera Foundation.\n- \u2202 Donation of protective equipment to 19 health centres in Cajamarca, Amazonas and San Mart\u00edn, regions in Peru where the Group has a direct presence.\n- \u2202 The acquisition of 36 oxygen cylinders and flowmeters for the Moquegua Hospital and the Health Centres located in the Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve in Peru.\n- \u2202 Awareness-raising and provision of protective equipment for 6 communities in the Peruvian city of Puno.\n- > Provision of a 3D printer to the Makerspace at the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Library to make over 800 pieces of protective healthcare equipment.\n- > Donation of bluetooth earphones so that those in hospital could stay in touch with family members.\n- > Involvement of employees in the corporate volunteering project based on the writing of letters for those in hospital (Solidarity Letters).\n- > Active involvement in the Positive Energy+ initiative; endorsement of startups capable of projects that could come to fruition in the short term to help mitigate the economic and social impact of the crisis.\n- > Joining the campaign launched by the Ministry for Equality and the Institute for Women and Equal Opportunities (IMIO per its Spanish acronym) to support victims of gender violence during the lockdown.\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFrom a financial and economic perspective, throughout this period the Group's financial position has been robust, enabling it to confront these difficult times through measures aimed at bolstering its liquidity. In 2020 the Group made two bond issues for a total amount of Euros 1,100 million, by way of Euros 700 million in January and Euros 400 million in April, and also entered into loan and credit facility agreements amounting to Euros 475 million. Following these transactions, and having already settled due debts and the payments arising from the acquisition of Argo Energia in Brazil, the Group's liquidity position at the end of 2020 stands at Euros 2,412 million, specifically Euros 482 million in available cash and Euros 1,930 million in\n\n<!-- image -->",

This position ensures the Group's ability to meet its operating cash flow requirements, to honour debt maturities for the coming years, and to address any adverse situations that could emerge in the financial markets over the coming months as a result of developments in the current crisis. In the next two years the Group will need to repay debt amounting to Euros 1,206 million, on the basis of Euros 164 million in 2021 and Euros 1,042 million in 2022.\n\nThe situation brought on by COVID-19 has not had a significant impact on the Group's activity. Nonetheless, in early February, the Company activated a monitoring committee, enabling the implementation of an exhaustive contingency plan.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group is setting its sights on a green recovery as the only way out of the economic crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the Group, the focal point of this model is to foster an inclusive and fair energy transition. In this regard, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has joined forces with initiatives both in Spain and in the international arena that endorse sustainability as a springboard to post-crisis economic recovery. These include the 'Manifesto for a Sustainable Recovery', championed by representatives from the political, corporate, trade union, scientific and third sector communities in Spain, and which is aligned with the Green Recovery Alliance in Europe, and the 'Uniting Business and Governments to Recover Better' statement, promoted by the prestigious Science-Based Targets initiative and supported by the United Nations. These two initiatives are seeking to pave a way forward out of the COVID-19 crisis that places people, achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, and an ambitious climate-related action plan at the very heart.\n\nThe Group's management and directors will continue to assess the situation and closely monitor any incidents arising in the infrastructure it manages, as well as trends in other external factors and the impact such factors could have on the financial statements.\n\n## 11.2 Description of the Group's business model\n\nThe Group has consolidated itself as a global operator of essential infrastructure, managing electricity transmission networks in Spain and Latin America, and telecommunications networks (fibre optics and satellites).\n\n## Management and operation of domestic electricity infrastructure\n\nConstruction and maintenance of power lines and electricity substations forming part of the transmission network (including international and inter-island interconnections) that match generation with consumption and operation in real-time in the Spanish electricity system, guaranteeing continuity of supply and the safe integration of renewable energy.\n\nIt also includes the design and construction of storage infrastructure in the Canary Islands, which serves as a tool for the operation of the electricity system to improve the integration of renewable energy and the safety of supply on the islands.\n\n## Management and operation of international electricity infrastructure\n\nConstruction and operation of energy transmission infrastructure in Peru, Chile and Brazil, and provision of electricity infrastructure maintenance services in Peru.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2017, the board of directors approved the Group's 2030 Sustainability Commitment. Through this commitment, the Group aims to achieve longterm continuity through a business model that is capable of responding to the challenges of the future and putting the principles set out in the Sustainability Policy into practice.\n\nThe 2030 Sustainability Commitment is backed by the board of directors and the Group's management team, whose message is transmitted to the entire organisation with a view to encouraging a proactive attitude that incorporates sustainability into day-to-day decision making. It is worth noting the creation of the Sustainability Committee within the board of directors in 2018 as a result of the strategic importance of sustainability for the Group. The key role of the Sustainability Steering Committee and the Corporate Division for Sustainability and External Relations, which reinforce the involvement of the highest decision-making levels and the involvement of all areas of the organisation in the implementation, supervision and monitoring of the 2030 Sustainability Commitment.\n\nIn 2019, the board of directors approved the Group's 2030 sustainability objectives, which lay out eleven proposals to measure compliance\n\nwith the commitments established in the four sustainability priorities, focusing on those aspects that provide answers to the great global challenges on the horizon for 2030.\n\nThe objectives, which are defined by the Sustainability Steering Committee and validated by the Sustainability Committee of the board of directors, are aligned with the priorities of the 2030 Sustainability Commitment, the Group's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This model ensures adequate management of the significant economic, social and environmental impacts of the activities and services of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group on its stakeholders, avoiding the risk of not rapidly identifying any problem that may affect the relationship with them. This model is composed of the following stages: identification and segmentation of stakeholders, prioritisation and definition of the framework and relationship channels.\n\nThe Group undertakes an annual programme of perception studies aimed at assessing stakeholders' satisfaction with its performance and ascertaining their requirements and expectations. As well as being a tool to foster dialogue and closer relationships with stakeholders, the studies are also an important driver of ongoing improvement for the Group.\n\nThe review of the perception studies continued in 2020 and improvements identified in 2019 were brought into the studies carried out during the year. Of note are the following improvements that were incorporated:\n\n-\n\n- > Improvement to the structure of the studies, adapting them to the 2030 Sustainability Commitment and seeking synergies among target issues and audience.\n- > Inclusion of relevant identified issues, alongside an assessment of their importance for each stakeholder group.\n- > Identification and reporting of overall indices, both in terms of perception and reputation.\n\nThe thorough review of the stakeholder management model, which began in 2020, is expected to continue through 2021. The aim is to build an up-to-date and prioritised inventory for each Red El\u00e9ctrica Group company, which will serve as the starting point to define new stakeholder relationship frameworks that are tailored to each subsidiary and in line with the Group's actual situation.\n\nThe Group currently classifies its stakeholders into the following categories: investors, shareholders and business partners, regulatory bodies and the administration, customers, people, suppliers, surrounding environment, opinion makers, business sector and professional associations and innovation agents.\n\n## 11.3 Information regarding environmental issues\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's commitment to the environment stems from management and is based on environmental policy, which includes the explicit commitment to the prevention of pollution and to precautionary principles. The involvement of all of the organisational units and the commitment of all of the Group's employees are essential to the implementation of this commitment.\n\nREE and REA have an Environmental Management System in place (ISO 14001 certified) to facilitate the ongoing improvement of their environmental performance. REE also meets the requirements established by the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).\n\nIn 2020 Group companies incurred ordinary expenses of Euros 23.7 million in protecting and improving the environment (Euros 26.1 million in 2019), essentially due to the implementation of environmental initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, fire prevention, landscape integration, climate change, and prevention of pollution.\n\nIn 2020 a total of Euros 5.4 million (Euros 3.2 million in 2019) was spent on environmental issues associated with investment projects (including environmental impact studies, environmental oversight of work, and the adoption of preventive, corrective and accompanying measures).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount allocated to environmental aspects associated with investment projects exceeded Euros 4.9 million, significantly more than in prior years (Euros 1.7 million in 2019), due to work carried out on future submarine links.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's main environmental impacts are those associated with the presence of the facilities in the area and, therefore, the Company is working to ensure they are compatible with the environment, considering their entire life cycle and paying special attention to the protection of biodiversity. In view of its role as a leading player in the transition towards a carbonfree energy model, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has taken on board a specific commitment in relation to the fight against climate change. The Group's environmental commitment is based on three pillars: environmental management and the integration of electricity facilities into the environment; the protection of biodiversity; and climate change.\n\n-\n\n## a) Environmental management and integration of electricity facilities into the environment\n\nThe main route to make facilities compatible with the environment is the selection of routes and sites so that the environmental impact is as low as possible. Additionally, the application of preventive and corrective measures and the monitoring of strict environmental criteria, make it possible for potential effects on the environment to be reduced significantly. The best tool to guarantee this process is an Environmental Impact Assessment. By law, most Red El\u00e9ctrica Group projects are subject to this procedure.\n\nThe measures implemented include those carried out during the construction of facilities to minimise land excavation and the impact on vegetation, fauna and the socio-economic environment (infrastructure, crops and archaeological heritage), and those related to the prevention of pollution. Actions aimed at mitigating the noise generated by certain electrical substations (plans for measuring and adjusting the operating parameters of certain power equipment to reduce noise levels) and reducing light pollution are also noteworthy. To address the latter issue, in recent years the Company has worked on implementing the necessary measures to enable facilities to be shut down at night, thereby limiting light pollution as much as possible while also achieving significant energy savings.\n\nIn addition, visual impact assessment methodologies and tools have been improved, areas affected by works have been restored and specific landscape integration projects have been undertaken so as to reduce the visual impact of the facilities.\n\nLastly, we should highlight the importance for the Group of working towards and making significant headway on the sustainable use of resources. The Group's sustainability ambitions with a view to 2030 is to become a leading player in the circular economy. The goals to be achieved and the actions to be carried out are enshrined in the Circular Economy Roadmap, which focuses on improvement in various dimensions:\n\n- > Materials: reduction in raw material consumption, promoting the use of materials that are or can be recycled. This notion includes action related to eco-design, which entails close cooperation with suppliers.\n- > Waste: a target of 0% landfill waste has been set for 2030.\n- > Land: steps aimed at minimising the risk of land or groundwater contamination due to hydrocarbon leaks or spills, as well as the cleaning up of land affected by accidents using sustainable techniques.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The specific commitment to biodiversity management was revised in 2020 and now includes the goal of having a positive impact on biodiversity wherever the Group is present.\n\nTo meet this ambitious goal, the Group has set out a series of strategic steps, which include the 'Development of the 2030 biodiversity roadmap'. The goal of this project is to develop a strategy and a number of action steps aimed at improving the relationship with natural capital, and to strengthen the commitment to protect, preserve and improve biodiversity.\n\nThe main effects on biodiversity are associated with the presence of facilities in the area. Most\n\nnotable is the risk of birds colliding with earth wires in power lines and the effect on vegetation of felling and pruning to open up firebreaks.\n\nBiodiversity management is carried out taking into account the impact mitigation hierarchy. Avoiding areas that are protected or highly biodiverse is a fundamental criterion when deciding on the location of facilities (in energy transmission infrastructure, only 15.5% of lines and 5.73% of substations are located in protected areas). The second step is to minimise possible affects and is achieved through the application of the corresponding preventive and corrective measures, including the restoration of habitats wherever possible. Lastly, different environmental improvement initiatives and projects are implemented, aimed at offsetting any impacts that may occur.\n\nThe multiannual Action Plan (2017-2021) currently in force contains the main activities to be executed in this period. The initiatives relating to the following areas are noteworthy:\n\n- > Protection of birdlife, the primary objective being to minimise the risk of birds colliding with earth wires, as mentioned above. A plan to use bird-saving devices in sections with the greatest potential impact for birds (more than 760 km of lines) has been devised and is due to be completed in 2023. Flagging of 66.5% of critical priority areas was completed in 2020.\n- > Prevention of forest fires, through appropriate design and maintenance of firebreaks and the joint efforts of the pertinent authorities in this field. There are currently 12 fire prevention agreements in place and two are being renewed. These agreements have an overall associated budget of more than Euros 960,000, which is allocated for a four-year period and channelled into cleaning up forest land, acquiring fire extinguishing and fire-fighting equipment, training and awareness.\n- > Implementation of conservation projects in cooperation with the government, NGOs and other bodies, notably including projects relating to birdlife conservation or those devised for the restoration of degraded areas. The latter include the 'Red El\u00e9ctrica Marine Forest' project to restore posidonia oceanica seagrass (planting of 2 hectares in the bay of Pollensa, Mallorca was completed in 2020), and the 'Red El\u00e9ctrica Forest', with an investment of over Euros 2 million, through which more than 860 hectares have been restored since 2009.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking on this role, in 2011, the Group decided to formalise a voluntary commitment in the fight against climate change, which materialised into a Climate Change Action Plan, the latest version of which was approved in 2015.\n\nThe plan includes the objectives for Horizon 2020 and Horizon 2030, as well as the main initiatives that will be undertaken to achieve them.\n\nAs a general objective, the Group is committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions per MWh transported by 40% in 2030 with respect to 2015. This objective was approved in 2018 by the Science Based Targets (SBTi) initiative and is equivalent to a net reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions of 30% by 2030.\n\nThe plan covers the following lines of action:\n\n- > Contribution to a low-emissions energy model, taking the necessary actions to achieve European objectives for 2020 and 2030:\n- \u2202 Ongoing investor involvement to develop a robust, intelligent and interconnected transmission network that enables the electrification and connection of new renewable energy capacity.\n- \u2202  Maximum integration of renewables by optimising the operation of the electricity system and progressing with storage systems.\n- \u2202 Furthering efficient network management by applying new measures for managing demand, incorporating new elements and services and encouraging technological innovation.\n- > Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the Group's activities. The main measures implemented apply to the following areas of action\n- \u2202 Reduction in SF6 gas emissions (mainly by renewing switchgear and improving the detection and control of leaks).\n- \u2202 Reduction in electricity consumption (energyefficiency measures for buildings, such as the renovation of the La Lomba building in 2020)\n\nand associated emissions (acquisition of 100% renewable energy).\n\n- \u2202 Sustainable mobility: reduction in emissions associated with the Group's vehicles, business trips and employee travel.\n- \u2202 Involvement of the supply chain in the Group's commitments. A programme has been started in this regard with the Group's main suppliers to include their data in the overall scope 3 emissions calculation and to set an ambitious target to reduce them.\n- \u2202 Progress in including efficiency criteria and reducing materials when designing facilities.\n- \u2202 Offsetting of emissions, primarily through the Red El\u00e9ctrica Forest project.\n- > Positioning and outreach: dissemination of knowledge of the electricity system and demand management measures, and promotion of other energy efficiency measures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2018 work began on the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which gave rise to a thorough review of the assessment, considering different scenarios and intensifying the economic quantification of risks and opportunities identified. Details of the TCFD recommendations are provided in note 4 on risk management in this consolidated directors' report.\n\nIn 2019 the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group joined the United Nations Business Ambition for 1.5\u00ba, through which it champions the commitment to review its targets and scale up its ambitions. Work to set new targets will continue through 2021, as will work on a new version of the Climate Change Action Plan to meet these new goals.\n\n## Environmental indicators\n\n| Indicators of a non-financial character                                                                 | 2020                  | 2019                  | %      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Direct greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1)  (tCO2 eq.)                                                   | 25,557                | 23,614                | 8.23   |\n| Indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope 2) (tCO2 eq.)

The reservoirs do not have mechanisms to record the stored water so it is not possible to calculate the percentage usage of rainwater.\n- (6) The 2020 data refers to the generation of waste by various Group companies (REE, Peru, Chile and HISPASAT), whereas the 2019 figure only refers to REE. To analyse and compare the waste generation data against the prior year, it must be borne in mind that REE generates over 95% of hazardous waste and over 70% of non-hazardous waste. The major decline in the generation of hazardous waste is due to the fall in maintenance, renovation and improvement activities in the wake of the pandemic. 63% of all the waste generated (hazardous and non-hazardous) has been recycled (this generic category includes reuse, recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion and regeneration).\n- (7) Relevant accidents are considered to be those categorised as significant, severe or major in the internal classification (level 3 accidents and above on a scale of 1 to 5).

The Group offers its personnel products such as medical insurance, training, life insurance, travel cards, luncheon vouchers and childcare vouchers, as well as REC stock option programmes.\n\nThe remuneration model for the management team includes a variable annual element which considers the contribution made to the achievement of individual objectives regarding efficiency, quality and other factors such as security and sustainability. As part of this model, members of senior management have a deferred variable element of remuneration, the purpose of which is to strengthen their motivation and commitment to achieving the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\nFurthermore, the Group continues to foster its leadership goals, which promote and link variable remuneration with the leadership model for the management team and with the Group's strategy. In 2020 the use of a results-based remuneration model for non-management personnel, based on a system of setting and monitoring challenges and deploying management team goals, was consolidated.\n\nThe Group, therefore, continues to make progress with the 'total remuneration' model, which consists of different elements (economic, financial, intangible and emotional), and which enables and supports new ways of working and the organisational and cultural transformation of the Group.\n\nThis approach includes recognition programmes linked to the development of innovative and efficient ideas, as well as revenue generation, in\n\norder to encourage the participation of all of the Group's professionals.\n\n## Details of the average remuneration of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's workforce\n\nWhen calculating the average remuneration, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group includes all elements of employee remuneration, as follows:\n\n- > Fixed remuneration\n- > Annual  variable  remuneration\n- > Remuneration in kind\n- > Personal supplements\n- > Job-related  supplements\n- > Benefits\n- > Compensation\n- > Contributions to long-term benefit schemes\n- > Long-term variable remuneration\n- > Overtime\n- > Allowances\n\n<!-- image -->",

The difference between the average salary for men and women is less than 1%.\n\n## Implementation of workplace disconnection policies\n\nArticle 88, the Right to Digital Disconnection from the Working Environment, of the Spanish Data Protection and Digital Rights Act (Organic Law 3/2018 of 5 December 2018), includes an obligation for companies to meet with employees' representatives and draft an internal policy for employees (including those in management positions) that defines how this right to disconnect can be exercised and the actions taken to train employees and raise awareness about the reasonable use of technology to prevent the risk of IT fatigue.\n\nFurthermore, according to this law, the right to digital disconnection must also be upheld in cases where employees are working from home part or all of the time, as well as in employees' homes with regard to the use of technology tools for work purposes.\n\nIn 2020 the Group endeavoured to meet the requirements enshrined in the aforementioned Law by introducing a Digital Disconnection Protocol that will go into effect in the first quarter of 2021. It defines how this right to disconnect can be exercised and the actions taken to train employees and raise awareness about the reasonable use of technology to prevent the risk of IT fatigue.\n\n## b) Organisation of working hours\n\nThe actual effective working day established for employees complies with legal standards of minimum required rights and with the conventional framework applicable at the corresponding Group company.\n\nA real and effective timetable of 1,690 hours per annum has been established for 81% of the Group's workforce. This is distributed according to circumstances at each work centre, with a basic 7-hour day schedule on every working day of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its healthy company management model, deployed through a multi-year plan, is aligned with the Group's Strategic Plan, the Human Resources Master Plan and the 2030 Sustainability Commitment of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group.\n\nWithin this framework, the healthy company model revolves around four main lines of action:\n\n- > Physical work environment: within the definition of the future energy model, identifying opportunities to generate value in the services offered.\n- > Participation in the community: through actions performed by the company that have an impact on improving the state of health and well-being of its employees' families and the communities in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- > Health resources: providing the workforce with tools to improve their physical and mental health, contributing to their well-being and quality of life.\n- > Psychosocial work environment: implementing management and work organisation tools and resources that favour the physical and psychosocial well-being of workers.\n\nThe model is deployed through annual programmes that aim to facilitate the continuity of the management model through continuous improvement and to consolidate the Group as a leader in best practices for safety, health and well-being, prevention, and promoting health.\n\nThe Group has a strategy and a specific action plan that promotes best practices in relation to occupational risk during activities and work carried out at its facilities. The objective is to go beyond mere legal compliance, by training, informing and raising awareness about the obligations and responsibilities that exist and to commit the whole Group to this goal.\n\nIn this context, higher risk tasks and activities are monitored on an ongoing basis by means of safety inspection programmes, which are essential to achieving the high levels of safety required. Accordingly, in 2020, 10,285 safety inspections were carried out on works and facilities, incidents having been detected in\n\n11.26% of cases. As a result of all the activities performed to control and monitor works, over 1,700 corrective actions were required, of which 85.34% were resolved while the rest are in the process of being resolved.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with construction and maintenance tasks at electricity facilities, the Group places special emphasis on training, awareness, consultation and participation (through the Health & Safety Committee, internal audits and working groups), improving safe conduct and the safety measures employed while work is being carried out by internal and external (contractors) personnel. In recent years, several initiatives aimed at reducing accidents during the works execution phases have been implemented.\n\nIn 2020 the Action Plan to improve health and safety was updated, establishing 2020-2023 as the new timeline in order to address the strategic challenge of being a Zero Accidents group. Two main lines of work have been established: Culture of Prevention and Innovation.\n\n- > Culture of Prevention: to instil a culture of prevention focused on the well-being of the people working at Red El\u00e9ctrica's facilities, promoting a safe working environment, strengthening the communication of all the aspects that contribute to increased safety when performing an activity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We manage innovation in health and safety, putting technology to work for people.\n\nThrough innovation management, we seek to make an impact on health and safety processes and promote the use of technology, with the help of Elewit, the Group's technology company. In 2020 pilot projects were undertaken with several startups specialising in different enabling technologies such as virtual and mixed reality, data analytics (big data), IoT (internet of things, which provides connected workers with sensors), and blockchain, applied to different use cases and proofs of concept.\n\nIn 2020, the key accident rates for Group employees were 2.87 (frequency rate) and 0.10 (severity index). In 2019, the rates were 4.13 (frequency rate) and 0.14 (severity index).\n\n## Workplace accidents and occupational illnesses\n\nRed El\u00e9ctrica conducts preventive monitoring of the health of its employees on an ongoing basis through its in-house medical service,\n\nwhich is responsible for checking employees' health through periodic medical examinations and consultations. As a result of the preventive measures applied, no incidents or risks of specific illnesses associated with the professional activities carried out or related to the workplace were identified.\n\n| Red El\u00e9ctrica Group                 | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                     | Male   | Female | Total  | Male   | Female | Total  |\n| Accidents with leave                | 9      | 1      | 10     | 10     | 3      | 13     |\n| Fatal accidents                     | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      |\n| Work days lost due to accidents (5) | 173    | 170    | 343    | 324    | 109    | 433    |\n| Accident frequency index            | 3.52   | 1.08   | 2.87   | 4.28   | 3.69   | 4.13   |\n| Accident severity index             | 0.07   | 0.18   | 0.10   | 0.14   | 0.13   | 0.14   |\n\nFrequency rate: number of work-related accidents resulting in leave per million hours worked.\n\nSeverity index: number of working days lost due to occupational accidents + incapacity scale, per thousand hours worked.\n\nMoreover, there were no occupational illnesses in either 2020 or 2019.\n\nRed El\u00e9ctrica implemented measures at the first news of the spread of COVID-19, which has allowed the contingency plans to be rolled out promptly and effectively.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic alert, reported cases have been monitored both in terms of illness and possible contact, and essential personnel, system operators and technical maintenance specialists have been identified and are subject to special monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This involves having workers' representatives at several Group companies as well as collective bargaining agreements, and holding talks and meetings on this topic.\n\n## Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement\n\n|                     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employees in Spain  | 91%    | 91%    |\n| Employees in Brazil | 98%    | 96%    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The negotiations concluded successfully and the 1st Collective Bargaining Agreement went into effect on 14 September 2020.\n\nConsequently, relations with employees' representatives were defined by the negotiation of a new agreement through the Negotiating Committee created for the purpose.\n\nDuring 2020, various meetings were held by Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a's Intercentre Committee and other committees in which employees' representatives are involved.\n\n## Summary of the collective bargaining agreements in the area of health and safety\n\nRed El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a has an occupational health and safety committee whose composition and functions are set out in Chapter 7 of the 11th Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nThis committee is a collegiate body with equal representation intended to provide regular and periodic consultation regarding the company's occupational health and safety actions. The committee consists of six representatives nominated by the company and six health and safety delegates chosen from among the employees' representatives, who represent 100% of the employees. Specialists from the company's health and safety service also attend the committee's meetings.\n\nThe committee meets every quarter (in accordance with Occupational Risk Prevention Law 31/1995) although it may also meet at the request of any of the parties. In 2020, the committee met four times in regular sessions in accordance with its objectives.\n\nThese meetings serve to monitor all health and safety activities, any new applicable legislation, the reviews of processes and internal regulations, as well as analysing and tracking the results and the occupational health & safety programmes and monitoring safety equipment and materials. The minutes of these meetings are available to\n\nall employees under a dedicated section of the miRED corporate intranet. This committee also receives the results of the internal and external audits that are carried out and any improvement actions that are implemented.\n\nAs a result of the health emergency triggered by the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), four special meetings were held during the year to report on the actions and measures taken by the company, particularly with regard to the work activities of essential personnel.\n\n## d) Training\n\nIn 2020, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's Campus was the main hub of Learning and Professional Development within the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group.\n\nThe Group's transformation continues to be promoted through the new leadership approach and the development of employees' capacities through specific programmes developed by the three institutions (business knowledge and technical training, strategy and leadership, and transformation and innovation).\n\nAs a result of the 'push yourself' (Imp\u00falsate) philosophy, a high component of selfdevelopment is encouraged in training, with the launch of programmes and learning spaces wherein the employees themselves decide how and when to participate based on their own\n\n<!-- image -->",

This new direction has translated into a new training catalogue composed of more than 200 online courses on different technical, management and skills-based subjects, as part of the 'Digital by Campus' programme aimed at the acquisition of skills and knowledge related to digital transformation and the 'Self-development Ecosystem' designed to improve the personal and professional skills of all employees.\n\nEmployees received 136,748 hours of training, equivalent to 67 hours per employee, at an investment of Euros 3,041.91 per person.\n\nAll employees are continuously assessed. The new appraisal model launched in 2019 continued to be used in 2020, effectively individualising the evaluation of an employee's contribution in order to increase objectivity and help align employees with the Group's strategy and encourage a culture of development and recognition.\n\nIn 2020 the Group consolidated the implementation of the challenge-based management model, which has contributed towards giving each professional clearer guidance about their work, with greater autonomy and flexibility, allowing employees to work when, where and how they require and with whoever needs them.\n\n## Training hours by professional category and gender:\n\n| Red El\u00e9ctrica Group      | Male    | Female   | 2020  Total   | Male    | Female   | 2019  Total     |\n|--------------------------|---------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|-----------------|\n| Management team          | 8,708   | 4,987    | 13,695        | 4,763   | 2,351    | 7,114           |\n| Technicians              | 94,164  | 23,178   | 117,342       | 108,452 | 24,046   | 132,498         |\n| Administrative personnel | 1,995   | 3,716    | 5,711         | 635     | 3,083    | 3,718           |\n| Total                    | 104,867 | 31,881   | 136,748       | 113,850 |          | 29,480  143,330 |\n\nThe voluntary and proactive internal mobility plan has become well established, together with the use of the LinkRED tool that can be accessed by all employees to share their experiences and interests in relation to development and mobility.\n\nIn addition, to help students on higher vocational training courses to obtain qualifications, the Group has been actively involved in creating a vocational training programme with theoretical and practical content, as part of the dual vocational training system leading to the qualification of Senior Power Plant Technician. In 2020, the second graduating class completed their training.\n\nThe aim of this initiative is to produce professionals who are qualified in this field and available to immediately take up maintenance specialist technician positions; to furnish the sector with trained professionals equipped with Red El\u00e9ctrica know-how; and to enhance the employability of young people, with a view to their becoming part of the domestic industrial fabric.\n\nDue to the preventive measures implemented by the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the programme for the second graduating class had to be redesigned, adapting it to a mixed format. This format combined a wide range of online technical and safety content using remote training via the TEAMS and FORMS corporate applications to teach the theory\n\n<!-- image -->",

This ensured that they attained the minimum required level of proficiency in protection while also acquiring agility and skill in the handling of equipment and tools and receiving the necessary safety training. The 20 students were thus able to complete their traineeships at their assigned work centres in the 8 transmission districts having gained sufficient knowledge of health and safety.\n\nLastly, every two years, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group runs a nine-month theoretical and practical programme led by the company's operators, that enables young engineering graduates to qualify as Electricity Control Centre Operators.\n\n## e) Integration and universal accessibility for people with disabilities\n\nDisabilities are one of the main areas of focus of the Comprehensive Diversity Plan approved at the start of 2019.\n\nThe General Law on the Rights of People with Disabilities (LGD) is applicable to three of the Group's companies, of which two comply with the law through direct employment: REINTEL (3.33%) and HISPASAT (2.05%). The company that does not comply through direct employment (REE) goes beyond legal compliance with exceptional alternative measures, achieving a rate of 2.47%. Of this percentage, 0.86% corresponds to\n\ndirect employment and the remainder to the application of exceptional alternative measures within the framework of the LGD, consisting of contracting goods and services from Special Employment Centres and making donations to entities whose mission is the social and labour integration of people with disabilities, and which support the Group in carrying out actions related to disabilities as part of the annual diversity programme and contribute to its social initiatives.\n\nThe number of Group employees with disabilities is as follows:\n\nPeople with disabilities\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n20\n\n19\n\nThe corporate website of Red El\u00e9ctrica was developed using website accessibility criteria with Level AA Conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).\n\nOne of the most valuable disability projects is the Family Plan, consisting of personalised\n\nassistance to improve social and labour integration of any Group employees' family members with disabilities.\n\nIn September 2020, Red El\u00e9ctrica took part in the Carrera de las Capacidades, a race event organised to raise disability awareness.\n\n## f) Equality and diversity\n\nThe Group's commitment to diversity, inclusion and non-discrimination has materialised in the form of its 2019-2022 Comprehensive Diversity Plan, which is aligned with the Group's Strategic Plan and the 2030 Sustainability Commitment. It seeks to inspire and become a benchmark for the Group itself and in the wider social, labour and human environment, through the Group's commitment to talent diversity, social inclusion, employment and non-discrimination, breaking down stereotypes and cultural barriers. The goals of the Comprehensive Diversity Plan are:\n\n- > Create a corporate culture that encourages diversity among employees and other stakeholders.\n- > Integrate diversity into all of the Group's processes, especially people management.\n- > Involve, raise awareness and promote the Group's mission and approach to diversity among collaborators and suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These aspects are monitored through indicators that enable the Group to measure the progress of the objectives defined.\n\nThe percentage of women in the Group's workforce in 2020 was 26.62% (25.88% in 2019). The number of women in management positions has once again increased, totalling 32.67% in 2020 (31.76% in 2019). These results are nearing the targets set for 2022.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group is committed to equality. The significant female presence on the Executive Committee is notable, with 55.56% women, as well as on the board of directors, where women have a 50% representation, the highest among the IBEX 35 companies.\n\nWe continue working on gender equality as shown by the indicators achieved in 2020 for equal opportunities in training: 0.97%, contracts: 1.1%, promotion: 1.38% and promotion to the management team: 1.57%.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group collaborated with entities and participated in various observatories and academic forums in relation to diversity, including:\n\n- > Collaboration in working roundtables and forums on diversity, equality and inclusion promoted by institutions such as IE Business School and the Spanish Association of Women Executives and Directors (EJE&CON), the Real Instituto Elcano and the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering (participation in the Women and Engineering project to foster the involvement of women in STEM careers).\n- > Woman Forward event.

This commitment is included in the rules of conduct and guidelines established in the Code of Ethics and the Sustainability Policy, and applies to the whole supply chain through the Code of Conduct for Group Suppliers. Lastly, as a member of the Spanish network of the United Nations Global Compact, Red El\u00e9ctrica has strengthened its commitment to human rights by signing up to\n\nthe ten principles of the Global Compact. In 2017 the company formalised a human rights management model, approved by the Sustainability Steering Committee, which applies to all of the Group's activities and is based on the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nThe Group takes an approach based on control and continuous improvement, implementing actions that help to prevent potential human rights violations, while seeking solutions to redress such violations in the event that they arise. In 2020 a total of 45 social audits were performed and 38 action plans were designed to redress major non-compliances, which apply to 18 suppliers. As regards human rights commitments, improvements aimed at fostering supplier development are agreed, and changes are measured so as to verify whether such improvements have been made, and otherwise to ban the supplier temporarily or permanently. In 2020 the Group did not identify any supplier contracts which have generated human rights incidents and there is no record of any such complaints being received.\n\nIn order to continue making progress in human rights management and to strengthen its commitment to upholding them, the company is working on improving the due diligence mechanisms to identify and evaluate actual or potential negative implications on human rights,\n\nspecifically those affecting local communities in the areas of activity.\n\nThe Group has set up a whistleblowing channel that is available to all stakeholders as a formal mechanism for addressing any human rightsrelated enquiries or complaints. The Group also has the D\u00cdGAME Service and ASA (the Procurement Support Service), through which stakeholders can express their concerns about any grievances in this area. In 2020, the D\u00cdGAME Service received five human rightsrelated complaints (two in 2019). 100% of these complaints have been resolved.\n\nThe whistleblowing channels available to stakeholders have not received any human rights-related complaints in respect of HISPASAT. None were received in 2019 either.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This means acting with the utmost integrity in discharging the Group's obligations and commitments, and in relations and cooperation with its stakeholders.\n\nThe Group has a series of corporate rules of conduct establishing the values, principles and standards of conduct that must be adhered to by all persons in the Group in the performance of their professional activities.\n\n## Code of Ethics and Conduct\n\nThe Group's Code of Ethics and Conduct applies to all Red El\u00e9ctrica Group personnel. It establishes and facilitates commitment to the ethical values, principles and standards of conduct that must govern our professional activity within the organisation.\n\nIn 2018 the company embarked upon a process of reviewing and updating the Code of Ethics in order to bring it into line with best practices for ethical management and compliance, as well as the structural changes in the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group. This process was completed on 26 May 2020 when the board of directors approved the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethics and Compliance Channel\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has set up an Ethics and Compliance Channel available to all the organisation's members and stakeholders, through which they can:\n\n- > Raise any queries regarding interpretation of the ethical values, principles and standards of conduct laid down in the Code, or propose improvements.\n- > Report any violations of the Code, legislation, internal regulations or commitments taken on by the organisation.\n- > Report any potential irregularities or violations related to financial, accounting or business malpractice.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's Ethics and Compliance Channel is managed by the Ethics Office in coordination with the Compliance area and its activity is governed by guidelines on the channel's management.\n\nOn 1 December 2020, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's Executive Committee approved the 'Guidelines for managing the Ethics and Compliance Channel', comprising the internal regulations for management of said channel. The new guidelines have been approved to bring the channel's activity into line with: the criteria of the Code of Ethics and Conduct; the Spanish Data\n\nProtection and Digital Rights Act (article 24 of which regulates whistleblowing systems); and Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law.\n\n## Enquiries and complaints processed in 2020\n\nA total of 10 enquiries were made to the Ethics Officer via the Ethics and Compliance Channel in 2020. Three complaints were received in relation to compliance with the Code of Ethics and Conduct in 2020, all of which were resolved by year-end (three complaints in 2019, one of which was unresolved at the 2019 year-end). None of the complaints were about non-compliance linked to the organisation's criminal risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The management and prevention of criminal risks that could affect the Group, based on its activities and business sectors, are thus incorporated into the Group's control processes.\n\nThe board of directors, as the ultimate body in charge of the Group's risk management, in accordance with applicable regulations, has designated the Criminal Compliance Committee as the specific body in control of the Group's Criminal Compliance System. The Criminal Compliance Committee is responsible for the supervision and monitoring of the Group's Criminal Compliance System and its objective is for the main criminal risks to be properly identified and managed, and to raise awareness of such risks within the organisation.\n\nIn 2020 the criminal and anti-bribery compliance system of the Parent of the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group (REC) and its subsidiary Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a (REE) was certified under UNE 19601 and ISO 37001. The certification process for this system was carried out by AENOR in December 2020.\n\nIn 2020, none of the Group's companies was investigated or found guilty of acts of non-\n\ncompliance linked to the organisation's criminal risks. Likewise, no complaints were filed in connection with potential cases of corruption and no Group company was investigated or found guilty by any court in connection with noncompliances linked to corruption cases.\n\n## Prevention of corruption and money laundering\n\nThe Code of Ethics and Conduct and the criminal and anti-bribery compliance system, which include aspects related to the fight against corruption and money laundering, constitute an effective mechanism for the detection and treatment of possible cases of corruption and fraud. The Group has a guide for the prevention of corruption, 'zero tolerance', which was approved by the board of directors in 2015 and sets out conduct guidelines and commitments, as well as the performance criteria and main controls in place at the company associated with corruption, including money laundering.\n\n## 11.7 Information regarding society Impact of the activity on employment and local development\n\nThe activities carried out by the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group undoubtedly have benefits for society, notably that they maintain the continuity and security of electricity supply in conditions of high quality.\n\nOnce again this year, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group's investment in the transmission network has benefitted society due to its dynamic effect on economic activity because by encouraging production it leads to an increase in wealth (as measured by GDP), in jobs and in tax revenue, which can be used to improve the general wellbeing of society. All this is the result not only of the Group's direct investments but also of the increase in activity driven by the circular flows of the economy.\n\nSince 2017, the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group has used a methodology based on multipliers computed using Input-Output Tables to estimate the level of general activity generated as a result of an initial investment. Calculations are performed taking into account three main effects:\n\n<!-- image -->",

All of this combined has generated tax revenue of US Dollars 2 million.\n\n## Impact of the activity on local communities and the local area\n\nThe Group focuses its socio-environmental commitment towards unlocking shared value with society by pursuing actions and investments that are aligned with its business goals and, while generating value for the Group, also have a positive impact on society, the local area and its inhabitants. It also contributes to the attainment of various challenges, such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals or those envisaged as part of the European 2020 energy strategy.\n\nShared value is created by the Group both in the way it develops and builds infrastructure and in the way it operates and delivers services to the effective systems it operates in and to its customers. This activity generates opportunities to unlock shared value throughout the infrastructure life cycle.\n\nIn addition, the Group supplements its projects in the area with collaboration schemes to nurture institutional and social relationships, transparently seeking collaboration agreements, disseminating information about the electricity network's performance and fostering involvement in projects and initiatives that boost socio-economic development, education, social well-being and the conservation, protection and enhancement of natural and cultural heritage in the countries and regions in which it operates.\n\nIn 2020, the Group contributed over Euros 9 million (amount calculated using the London Benchmarking Group methodology) to social initiatives (over Euros 8 million in 2019). Of particular note is the contribution of more than Euros 2.4 million to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the global pandemic triggered by COVID-19. Contributions to foundations and non-profit organisations, totalling Euros 1.4 million (Euros 1.7 million in 2019), accounted for 53 (62 in 2019) of all the social initiatives carried out by the Group in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the company signed 89 agreements with public and social entities, mainly to cooperate on socio-economic, environmental, educational and cultural development projects.\n\nAmong the 377 social initiatives undertaken, special attention has been paid to those focused on a rapid and effective response to needs arising as a result of COVID-19, the mitigation of population drift, and the conservation of biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group extends its responsibility over the supply chain and adheres to a responsible management model, based on the principles of non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality, equal treatment and transparency, as well as a framework of legislation and internal Group codes, policies and rules.\n\nIn 2020 the Red El\u00e9ctrica Group worked with 1,292 suppliers in transactions worth Euros 599.6 million. Of that amount, 85.4% relates to services and works, while the remaining 14.6% pertains to materials and equipment.\n\nBesides the aforementioned suppliers, an additional 718 subcontractors also did work on electricity network facilities, bringing the total number of companies that worked within the framework of the Group's contracts to 2,010.\n\nThe local purchases indicator (purchases from suppliers based in the same country) was 88.2% for Red El\u00e9ctrica Group companies in Spain, 97.5% for those in Chile and 97.0% for those in Peru; which means the Group acts as a driver of growth, favouring business, industrial and social development by creating employment throughout the supply chain.\n\nThe Group verifies that approved suppliers meet the minimum requirements, which vary depending on the supply contract: they must have accepted the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, show evidence of a stable financial position, fulfil certain minimum quality guarantee criteria, have adequate public liability insurance, and provide references and records of previous work.\n\nShould more specific environmental and social criteria be needed (in addition to those required for approval), these are conveyed by the Group's technical areas as part of the technical specifications that will form part of the tender process. Their evaluation would form part of the technical assessment of the tender bids received.\n\nThe monitoring process verifies the suppliers' performance in the context of the contracts with the company and the ongoing fulfilment of the requirements made upon approval. The main areas screened are: (1) business (monitoring of the financial solvency of all approved suppliers and application of mitigating measures, continuous oversight of legal matters such as being up-to-date with payments to the Spanish taxation authorities, Social Security, public liability insurance, etc.), (2) technical, and (3) social responsibility (verification of proper adherence to the Code of Conduct for Suppliers through social audits).\n\nSocial audits were conducted at 45 suppliers during 2020 (53 in 2019) to verify compliance with the Code of Conduct for Suppliers. As a result of the audits, 38 action plans have been agreed with 18 suppliers, so that supplier development can be monitored and improvements recorded. The results of these audits and their findings are shared internally, placing special emphasis on the detection of major non-compliances.\n\n## Consumers\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 the Group launched a project to analyse the way in which each Group company deals with stakeholder interactions. The aim is to draw conclusions to establish a procedure defining common grounds for managing such interactions from a Group perspective, allowing the company to consolidate existing information and function as a single corporate system that improves interactions with external stakeholders. Once defined, the Group will apply this master procedure to each company and iron out the specifics that could not be regulated in the general procedure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The service is manned by employees of Fundaci\u00f3n Juan XXIII Roncalli, a non-profit entity that facilitates the workplace integration of people with disabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interactions through the D\u00edgame service in 2020\n\nIn 2020 a total of 3,559 interactions were received and managed through the D\u00edgame service ( ), with stakeholders from the surrounding environment accounting for the highest number (1,560), followed by investors and shareholders (573), and then customers and business sectors and associations (572 each). To a lesser extent the Group has recorded interactions with regulatory bodies and governments, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Claims handled through the D\u00edgame service in 2020\n\nOf the 260 claims received, 219 fell under Red El\u00e9ctrica's remit and were admitted. Of these, 58 were upheld (accepted on correct and reasonable grounds, whether fully or partially).\n\n- (4) 'Interactions' comprise any communication between Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a and a stakeholder. Interactions are classified into: queries, case files, notifications, requests, grievances, claims, recognitions and suggestions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first type primarily consists of claims related to the incidents in Tenerife in September 2019 and August 2020, while the second type mainly comprises claims concerning tree felling and clearing of vegetation.\n\nWhile some claims remain open, 95% of the claims accepted have been closed.

All such claimants seek compensation for the impact of facilities.\n\nIn Peru, 53 of the interactions are in the process of being resolved, whereas all cases in Chile were closed during the year.\n\n## REINTEL\n\nREINTEL has its own 24/7 service and supervision centre, which controls and monitors the status of the network and handles incidents and scheduled work of customers, with the aim of offering a reliable service of the utmost quality. In 2020 a total of 533 network incidents affecting customers were handled. Of these, 63% stemmed from power failures, third party works and natural causes, while the remaining 37% were due to scheduled network work. These incidents were handled and resolved as part of normal business within the timeframes established in the customers' contracts.\n\n## HISPASAT\n\nHISPASAT also maintains an ongoing dialogue with its customers, providing them with various tools for direct communication: 24/7 customer service call centre offered in three languages (Spanish, Portuguese and English) with local phone numbers, a support centre and a web portal, allowing customers to open service incidents or request information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020 it received a total of 3,769 interactions, primarily queries (58.6%).\n\nCada dos a\u00f1os HISPASAT realiza una encuesta de satisfacci\u00f3n de clientes. En 2017, el \u00edndice neto de satisfacci\u00f3n global fue de un 83,6%, mientras que, en 2019, los resultados fueron del 82,1%.\n\nHISPASAT surveys customer satisfaction every two years.

In the case of the electricity transmission activity, it should be noted that due to the criteria applied in the design of the facilities, the levels of the electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) remain below those recommended by the Council of the European Union (Official Journal of the European Communities 1999/519/ EC: limitation of exposure of the general public in areas where they spend significant time - 5 kV/m for the electric field and 100 \u00b5t for the magnetic field). The main criteria applied are as follows:\n\n- > Construction of double circuits and phased translocation in lines.\n- > Raising the height of supports, thereby increasing the safety distances.\n- > Minimum distances from the lines to population centres and isolated homes.\n\nTo verify compliance with recommendations, the Group has a tool that uses certain line parameters to accurately gauge the maximum levels of EMFs that the facilities can generate.\n\n## Tax information\n\nThe Group is committed to compliance with tax laws and the fulfilment of its tax obligations, seeks a cooperative relationship with the taxation authorities and considers it important to\n\ncontribute to economic and social development by paying taxes in all the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe Red El\u00e9ctrica Group was recognised by the Commitment and Transparency Foundation for topping the rankings in the Tax Responsibility Transparency Report on the IBEX 35 in 2019. This analyses the voluntary transparency of content related to the tax obligations of IBEX 35 companies. The Red El\u00e9ctrica Group scored maximum points and led the transparent companies category.\n\nThe Group's tax strategy was approved by the board of directors on 30 June 2015 and is intended to define a consistent approach to tax matters in line with the Group's strategy. It embodies the Group's vision and objectives in tax matters and is based on three core values: transparency, good governance and responsibility.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, the board of directors approved the Group's Tax Risk Control and Management Policy and its inclusion in the Comprehensive Risk Management Policy. The tax risk control and management systems are described in the corporate governance report.\n\nThe Group's Tax Strategy and Comprehensive Risk Management Policy may be consulted on the corporate website.\n\n<!-- image -->",
