In essence, value creation is derived from a conscious and strategic effort at pursuing the realisation of the 5Ps as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('UNSDG').\n\nSunway's approach to <IR> remains firmly rooted from a sustainability perspective; that is to showcase how the Group continued to focus on a triple bottom-line of Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance ('EESG') perspectives that leads to the realisation of financial and non-financial values for stakeholders.\n\n## APPROACH TO REPORT CONTENT\n\nIn selecting relevant content for the Integrated Annual Report 2020 ('IAR2020'), Sunway has adopted the following materiality criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Information that is pertinent to the Group's resources (capitals)\n- \u00b7 Information that is pertinent to the business model\n- \u00b7 Information that is pertinent to outputs and outcomes created (financial and non-financial values)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CONTENT  ELEMENT                                                                                                                                                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ICON   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Corporate Profile  A comprehensive description of the Group, its business divisions, principal business activities,  network of operations and key facts and figures of the Group. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |\n| Our Value  Creation  Approach                                                                                                                                                      | financial and non-financial values.

SunCon is also well regarded in India as a highway builder and continues to establish its brand name within the country.\n\nAs a turnkey contractor, SunCon provides a full scope of construction services comprising building, civil and infrastructure engineering works, foundation and geotechnical engineering, mechanical, electrical and plumbing services (MEP), sustainable energy services, to the manufacture and sale of precast concrete products.\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nThe Healthcare division was established in 1999 through Sunway Medical Centre, which is the division's flagship hospital in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. Progressively, the division has set up more healthcare facilities across the country and in Singapore, with each becoming preferred healthcare provider among the local communities. These include Sunway Medical Centre Velocity in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Sunway Specialist Centre Damansara, Sunway TCM Centre, Sunway Home Healthcare, SunMed Clinic in Sunway Pyramid and Sunway Medical Centre Singapore.\n\nThe hospitals are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and technology and staffed by some of the most experienced and skilled healthcare professionals, including a wide range of specialists doctors.\n\nThe division will continue to grow its footprint with six more hospitals planned over the next 6 to 7 years within Sunway's integrated developments in Malaysia.\n\n## TRADING AND MANUFACTURING\n\nThe Trading and Manufacturing division commenced operations in 1983 and over the years, has grown into a leading, international trader as a licensed distributor for various brands.

        "page_content": "12\n\n## OUR VALUE CREATION APPROACH\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSunway's value creation narrative begins with  its  Build,  Own,  Operate  ('BOO') business model.\n\nThe BOO model entails the consumption of a wide range of resources or inputs for the development of infrastructure assets, residential and commercial properties as well as other types of built assets. While the Group can operate as a third party contractor  by  constructing  assets  for others, its primary focus is to own assets built to generate recurring income and enable the Group to expand its business presence across its chosen industries.\n\nAssets  that  are  owned  by  the  Group are  either  outright  sold  for  profits,  or are retained for recurring income or to drive diversification into other economic sectors such as hospitality, healthcare, leisure, retail and others. This enables the Group to develop multiple income streams  including  recurring  incomes while reducing dependence  on  its property development and construction operations.\n\nIn further unlocking value, assets owned by  the  Group  can  be  injected  into Sunway REIT. This enables the Group to retain ownership of the assets while realising its values.\n\nThis business model enables the Group to strengthen the overall value proposition of its townships and to harness business and operational synergy.\n\nLandbank acquisition \u00b7 Masterplanning and design \u00b7 Supply chain functions \u00b7 Raw materials \u00b7 Talent and expertise\n\n## BUSINESS & STRATEGIC SYNERGY\n\nSupport Functions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUILD TO SELL\n\nRevolving around the Property Development division, where landbank is developed into townships or standalone developments.\n\n## Challenges:\n\nLack of suitable landbank, sluggish economy, weaker consumer sentiment, increasing market competition, lack of financing to support buyers.\n\n## Opportunities:\n\nNew customer experiences via digitalisation, new lifestyle concepts and products such as co-living spaces for the growing population.\n\n## BUILD FOR OTHERS\n\nThe Construction division, SunCon functions as the builder for a wide range of large scale public and private sector infrastructure projects. SunCon provides technical skills, systems, processes, labour and equipment to develop the project to completion.\n\n## Challenges:\n\nLack of large scale infrastructure projects in Malaysia. Increasing competition, rising operating costs and labour shortages.\n\n## Opportunities:\n\nGreenfield opportunities in overseas markets, market leadership position through VDC and BIM capabilities, projects sourced from the Group.\n\n## BUILD AND MANAGE BUILD, OWN, OPERATE\n\nAssets that are completed and owned by the Group are retained and managed to ensure better development control.\n\n## Challenges:\n\nSluggish economic backdrop, weaker consumer sentiment, increasing market competition, pandemic impacts.\n\n## Opportunities:\n\nAbility to unlock asset value while retaining ownership with the capital generated used to acquire new assets.\n\nThe  BOO  approach  enables  a  wide  range  of  cross-functional collaborations between Sunway's various business divisions. This enables a more robust value creation model as well as other strategic benefits such as faster time to market, reduced business costs, more competitive value propositions and also retaining revenues within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe  Property  Development  division  is  able  to  leverage  on  the Construction division's strength as it is a proven quality builder for some of its projects. The Property Development division can also leverage on the Healthcare, Leisure and Hospitality divisions to strengthen its value proposition, especially in terms of developing integrated townships.\n\n## CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe Construction division is able to tender for infrastructure projects within the Group. As at 31 December 2020, RM2.39 billion of the former's order book comprised internal projects - secured, which cushioned the impact from the pandemic crisis. Some of the projects were: Sunway International School, Sunway Belfield serviced apartments, CP2 mixed commercial development, Sunway Velocity 2 Plot B serviced apartments and Sunway Medical Centre 4.\n\n## HEALTHCARE, LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY\n\nBeyond cross-sharing of data and customer insights, each division may tap the unique attractions of the others to develop more customerfocused value propositions. For example, Healthcare division may take in medical travellers and offer them accommodation at one of the Hospitality division's hotels. This can be further supplemented with complimentary tickets to the Leisure division's theme parks or other promotional campaigns.\n\n## QUARRY, TRADING AND MANUFACTURING AND BUILDING MATERIALS\n\nThe  three  divisions  supply  some  of  the  building  materials  for SunCon to undertake construction projects. This provides SunCon with greater assurance of the availability of raw materials to ensure infrastructure works can proceed and be completed as scheduled.\n\n13",

This is in line with the Guidance Notes and FAQs on the Conduct of General Meetings for Listed Issuers as issued by the Securities Commission Malaysia.\n\nIn June 2019, Sunway Berhad's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. had entered into a Share Sale Agreement with Dolomite Industries Company Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary of Dolomite Corporation Berhad, to acquire 100% of the total issued and paid-up share capital in Dolomite Granite Quarry Sdn. Bhd. together with 4 parcels of leasehold lands and plants and machinery for RM125 million. The acquisition was completed on 11 September 2020.\n\nIn response to charity homes hit hard by the MCO, contributions from the Sunway staff through its #SunwayforGood Fund, have channelled close to RM130,000 to foot electricity bills up to six months, for 16 charity homes nationwide.\n\nThe 16 selected homes which received the utility bill aid are located in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor. They are Rumah Pengurusan Al-Firdaus, Rumah Kasih Harmoni Paya Jaras, Pusat Jagaan Anbe Sivam, Pertubuhan Kebajikan Ehsan As-Shakur, Pertubuhan Anak Yatim & Miskin Pinang Klang, Johor Cheshire Home, Pertubuhan Kebajikan Puspanesam, Rumah Sinar Kebahagian, Shammah Children Home, Pusat Jagaan Sinar Ceria, Rumah Sejahtera Permatang Tinggi, Pertubuhan Rumah Sinar, House of Hope, Pusat Jagaan Rumah Juara Puchong, Pertubuhan Kebajikan Anak-anak Yatim dan OKU Mesra and Rumah Hope.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway embarked on its Food for Thought campaign to distribute packed meals to the urban poor in the Klang Valley needing nutritional support during the Conditional Movement Control Order ('CMCO') period.\n\nThe campaign was first undertaken upon the announcement of the reenforcement of CMCO in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Putrajaya from 14 to 27 October with a target distribution of 4,050 packs of food. Subsequently, Sunway doubled its commitment and delivered 8,100 packs in response to the extension of the CMCO until 9 November 2020.\n\nThe food packs were provided by Sunway's malls in the Klang Valley, namely Sunway Pyramid, Sunway Velocity Mall and Sunway Putra Mall. Sunway worked with NGOs Kechara Soup Kitchen and Adab Youth Garage to distribute the food packs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n31",

The identification of these business strengths is important as strengths form a key component of the strategic quartet that also includes the external operating environment, the business model and business strategies. At any given time, any of the identified factors from the strategic quartet may influence the other directly or indirectly.\n\nBusiness  strengths  may  influence  the  choice  of  implemented strategies by the Group or any particular business division as Sunway chooses to leverage on its inherent advantages to optimise value creation. Trends and developments in the external environment may necessitate changes to the business model or business strategies. Such developments may alter the Group's overall business strengths.\n\nAt the same time, business strategies may serve as the catalyst for enhancements to be made to the business model in response to the external environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUSINESS STRENGTHS DESCRIPTION\n\nDiversified & Integrated Business Group\n\nSunway's diversified business operations provide the Group with exposure to a large number of industries and economic sectors, while the business divisions are leading players in their respective industries.\n\nThe conglomerate approach reduces dependence on a single industry, which may be prone to cyclical downturns. This also enables the advantage of deriving multiple income streams, comprising recurring and nonrecurring revenues.\n\nDiversity and integration of businesses in the Group's portfolio allows for greater dynamics in products and services offered and allows for easier penetration into other emerging business opportunities.\n\nThe diversified portfolio enables the Group to explore opportunities across other continents, where selected businesses can be tailored to suit various business environments abroad.\n\n## STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE ON STRENGTH\n\nThe Group's business divisions continue to collaborate to enable cost and operational efficiencies and stronger project management.\n\nCollaboration also enables the cross-functional sharing of ideas, best practices and talents, and by leveraging on the capabilities of different business units, the ability to harness strategic synergy to develop more compelling value propositions and competitive advantage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to the Opportunities and Strategic Priorities on pages 44 to 47 for more information.\n\n## OUR BUSINESS STRENGTHS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| BUSINESS STRENGTHS                 | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE   ON STRENGTH                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| International Presence             | The Group has a diversified geographical  presence in multiple countries/markets.

In doing so, Sunway has emerged as an industry leader for sustainability, which is at the core of the Group's business model.\n\nBy placing sustainability at the heart of its business model, the Group creates enduring value that results in positive outcomes.\n\nAt the Group or business unit level, Sunway is helmed by proven industry captains with diverse capabilities and proven track records for excellent performance and results, led by the Group founder and Chairman, Tan Sri Dato' Seri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah.\n\n## STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE ON STRENGTH\n\n- In 2020, given the pandemic period, the Group's divisions have continued to reskill and upskill its employees, while also providing intra-division or inter division job rotation opportunities.\n\nThe large talent pool also enables a more effective leadership succession plan as there are more potential candidates for grooming to fill leadership roles going forward.\n\nIn 2020, good governance has been the basis for strengthening a wide range of policies, processes and business practices.\n\nNew and strengthened policies include the Anti-Bribery and Corruption ('ABC') Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to the Corporate Governance Overview Statement on pages 131 to 147 for more information.\n\nThe Construction division continues to develop its sustainable energy business segment, with several successful solar photovoltaic ('PV') installations in FY 2020.\n\nVarious business divisions have also looked to improve their environmental performance, by recycling waste, reducing energy and resource consumption and improving health and safety aspects of their operations (in light of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a commitment to ensure a safe workplace and environment for staff and stakeholders.)\n\nSunway's well-functioning leadership team formulates business strategies to ensure the Group's continual growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nSunway continues to review its external or macro-operating environment as emerging trends and developments could significantly impact the Group's business model and its ability to create value.\n\nThe Group assess how political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental ('PESTLE') factors may lead to present or future impacts. The impact may be positive or negative or at times, akin to a double-edged sword, offer both negative and positive impacts.

Sunway Ventures has been established to seek out these new business models, which are often driven by digitalisation and new technologies.\n\n## STRATEGIC THRUSTS\n\nOverseas Expansion\n\n- Business and Operational Synergy\n\nTalent Management\n\nDigitalisation\n\nSustainable and Smart Cities\n\nGovernance\n\nStrategic Priorities for individual business divisions are provided in their respective Strategic Profiles in Our Industry Strategic Profiles section of the IAR2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OVERSEAS EXPANSION\n\nSunway remains focused on expanding its business footprint in its chosen overseas markets where exciting growth opportunities remain. While the Group is committed to Malaysia as its primary operating base, Sunway intends to tap potentials in both developed and developing markets for many of the Group's business divisions.\n\nOn the back of the highway contract wins in India, SunCon is well placed to further entrench its position in the subcontinent, where demand for highways, bridges and large-scale infrastructure projects remains strong.\n\nThe Property Development and Hospitality divisions also have a successful presence in multiple geographical markets. This can be leveraged upon to grow its overseas project portfolio.\n\nThe Healthcare division has successfully expanded into Singapore in 2019 and having gained a niche foothold in this competitive but affluent marketspace, is well poised to explore new prospects. Ultimately, through synergy, the presence on one division in a foreign country can be leveraged to enable the expansion of other divisions into that particular market.\n\n## BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL SYNERGY\n\nWhile synergy has been harnessed by the Group's business divisions in various capacities and models, there remains far more synergistic potential at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.\n\nBeyond  cross-sharing  of  information,  talent  and  best  practices, synergy can be harnessed to bring to market, new value propositions or  enhanced  business  models.  This  includes  new  products  or services, or new technologies that leads to market disruption and first mover advantage.\n\nSynergy also supports revenue performance. In addition to pursuing external  contracts  from  both  local  and  overseas,  construction projects  from  within  the  Group  also  helps  to  provide  bedrock projects for SunCon to replenish its order book. In return, Sunway's other business divisions' benefit from SunCon's stable track record of quality assurance and project expertise.\n\nThe Healthcare, Leisure and Hospitality divisions continue to explore the development of synergistic packages and services that would cater  to  local  tourists,  healthcare  travellers  and  those  seeking entertainment.\n\nThe opportunities for synergy are abundant and one of the 2021 priorities is to continue to uncover, and create even more such opportunities going forward.\n\n## TALENT MANAGEMENT\n\nTalent has, and will continue to remain a priority for Sunway. Talent is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the Group's business model. It is the principal driver and catalyst for the Group's business model.\n\nSkilled, experienced, motivated employees are the backbone of the Group and hence, there is continued emphasis on recruiting, training, retaining and rewarding staff and developing a conducive organisational culture that leads to job satisfaction and a desire to stay and grow their careers within Sunway.\n\nVarious strategic efforts to attract and retain talents continued to be undertaken, spearheaded by Group HR with Senior Management and the Board of Directors having oversight on the talent management agenda. The Group continues to invest in knowledge management towards optimising its employees' intellectual capital.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pandemic has shown the importance of digitalisation in removing redundancies and inefficiencies within the value chains of all business divisions.\n\nSocial distancing has led to physical barriers and other difficulties. Digitalisation along with  the  aforementioned  talent  management  remain  pivotal  to  ensuring  a  flexible organisation that can respond swiftly and appropriately to the changing norms of customer engagement and business operations.\n\nWith costs increasingly becoming a key factor in the value proposition, digitalisation will enable reduced costs in the medium and long-term. It will enable us to continue reaching  out  to  customers,  both  locally  and  abroad.  However,  in  the  short-term substantial investments are required in technological acquisition, training of staff and the deployment of systems. There may also be a learning curve before optimum productivity can be achieved.\n\nOur tripartite collaboration with Celcom and Huawei to develop Smart Township Solutions with 5G connectivity as an enabler for Sunway Group, is an example of how Sunway is tapping digitalisation to drive business strength and deliver enhanced value creation.\n\nWhile Sunway has made tremendous technological progress over the last 20 years, the Group intends to accelerate its digitalisation adoption towards enhancing its BOO business  model  and  in  further  realising  the  aspirations  of  sustainable,  smart  city development that leads to the achievement of the UNSDG.\n\nSunway has been consolidating data from all business divisions to contribute to the realisation of the Malaysia Smart City Framework. Several stages have already been implemented across Sunway  City  Kuala  Lumpur  township.  These include  smart  parking,  magic  mirror,  urban farming,  intelligent  urban  transportation  and more.\n\n## REINVENTING URBAN TRANSPORTATION\n\nAmong  the  Group's  key  focus  areas  is  the implementation  of  the  sustainable  intelligent transport eco-system ('SITE'), which enables reduction  in  carbon  emissions  and  more efficient energy consumption for urban mobility.\n\nIn essence, the system is designed to provide comfortable, convenient and smarter daily travel within Sunway's cities. It will encompass traffic management, a focus on public transportation and other modes of transports such as walking and cycling instead of private cars and more.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n## URBAN FARMING\n\nUrban farming is also another focus area via Sunway FutureX Farm, an initiative helmed by Sunway iLabs to promote urban farming towards making communities food sufficient.\n\nThe approach is based on a farm to fork approach, where the community is able to generate its fresh food and produce to meet its immediate needs. It strengthens local food supply chains and contributes to food security. Other benefits include:\n\n- \u00b7  Optimisation of underutilised spaces such as rooftops to generate sustainable food.\n- \u00b7  Increase food production to reduce the national food import bill.\n- \u00b7  Decentralises farming and reduces logistical issues associated with transportation of produce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our initiatives towards a sustainable and smart city in our Sustainability Report 2020.\n\nThe continued emphasis on practicing good corporate governance is necessary towards mitigating against financial and non-financial risks and to ensure a well-managed conglomerate that is truly driven by value creation aspirations.\n\nThrough oversight and the implementation of appropriate control mechanisms and processes, Sunway and its business divisions have a shared sense of accountability, responsibility and conduct its business in a responsible and equitable manner that leads to mutually beneficial shareholder value creation.\n\nWhile  strategy,  people,  business  processes  and  external  trends and  development  are  all  vital  to  value  creation,  a  robust  and comprehensive governance structure that provides the necessary oversight is essential.\n\nSunway's Board of Directors and Senior Management will look to continue strengthening corporate governance within the organisation and cascading the same to all business divisions. Good governance is to be a way of life within Sunway's organisational culture and mindset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n47",

These portfolio of investment properties are primarily located within the integrated townships and developments of Sunway, allowing the Group to manage its own properties. Matured retail and commercial assets such as malls and office buildings owned by the Group are subsequently injected into a REIT vehicle. This enables Sunway to unlock the value of its property assets, recycle its capital and still retain control of the same. The Group is able to actively manage and develop its property value chain and enables REIT unit holders to participate in the wealth creation potential of Sunway's properties.\n\nRevenue and earnings are derived from rental income, which are distributed to unit holders. The model completes the BOO loop and provides the stability of recurring income from a stable asset portfolio.\n\n| YEAR           | ASSET UNDER MANAGEMENT ('AUM')   |   TOTAL NET LETTABLE AREA ('NLA') (SQ FT) |\n|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| RM8.8 billion  | 9.3 million                      |                                      2016 |\n| RM9.4 billion  | 10.0 million                     |                                      2017 |\n| RM9.9 billion  | 10.2 million                     |                                      2018 |\n| RM10.7 billion | 11.3 million                     |                                      2019 |\n| RM10.9 BILLION | 11.6 MILLION                     |                                      2020 |\n\n## BUSINESS STRENGTHS\n\n<!-- image -->",

Even with the rollout of accommodative fiscal and monetary policies as well as stimulus packages introduced by central banks and governments worldwide, the global gross domestic product ('GDP') and that of Malaysia's contracted by 4.4% and 5.6% respectively in 2020.\n\nMost  industries  were  adversely  affected,  particularly  tourism, hospitality, leisure, aviation and retail, followed by sectors such as property development and construction as a result of tightened spending  and  general  uncertainty  that  dampened  consumer demand.  Sectoral  performance  in  Malaysia  varied  following  the implementation of various phases of MCO throughout 2020. The nation had appeared to progress towards recovery in the second half of the year, until a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in the last quarter of 2020 that led to the re-imposition of CMCO.\n\nEcoWalk at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUNWAY RISES TO THE CHALLENGE\n\nConsidering  the  extraordinary  circumstances  of  the  operating environment in 2020, I am pleased to say that Sunway has performed commendably during the year. Leveraging our legacy, our inherent capabilities and the sound fundamentals of our sustainability-driven strategies, we have demonstrated our resilience through our ability to respond, reinvent and recover from this adversity.\n\nAs  with  most  businesses,  the  pandemic  caused  significant disruptions in our operations.  Sunway was able to respond swiftly as a result of our business continuity plans we had in place to mitigate the impact and repercussions of crises, which we enhanced to adapt to the current situation. This includes the extensive and industryleading digital transformation we embarked on in 2000. Sunway had already been moving steadily towards digitalisation even before the pandemic struck and we constantly invest in resources and infrastructure to ensure that our employees have the right tools to work efficiently and productively anytime and anywhere. This has allowed us to experience seamless migration of our operations from a physical to a virtual space when the work-from-home orders were implemented during the MCO. We have since accelerated our digital transformation efforts across the Group to ensure that we remain agile in a dynamically changing landscape. It is clear that the future will  become  more  data-driven  and  digitally  connected,  so  it  is imperative for us to continue our investment in technology enablers, digital platforms and infrastructures, as well as digital businesses as a fundamental part of Sunway's business ecosystem.\n\nOur preparedness served us well as Sunway entered the year of the pandemic on a strong footing to face the multi-fold challenges of the pandemic in terms of our balance sheet, talent strength, corporate infrastructure and business stability. At the start of the pandemic,\n\nwe were quick to implement cost containment and productivity improvement measures in anticipation of the fallout, which helped the Group weather the COVID-19 crises and supported the recovery across our business divisions. We then took this opportunity to strengthen our capital base and embarked on strategic investments, which allow us to capitalise on growth when the economy eventually recovers.\n\nWe formed a comprehensive internal crisis management response and recovery task force comprising doctors, security personnel, communications experts, facility managers, cybersecurity representatives and more, to guide us as we navigate through the challenges of the COVID-19 landscape. Within days of MCO 1.0, the #SunwayforGood Fund was swiftly set up with full consent and support of our senior management and in collaboration with Jeffrey Cheah Foundation, to collect donations from all Sunway employees. The funds were channelled to aid frontline healthcare workers who had been working tirelessly since the COVID-19 outbreak and those in the essential and critical services across Sunway businesses, as well as the B40 communities in the vicinity of Sunway townships nationwide who needed the most help during these trying times.\n\nAll in all, Sunway Group had committed more than RM34 million in  total  that  helped  more  than  40,000  Malaysian  beneficiaries amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But even more commendable is the unwavering dedication, commitment and contribution of our employees,  some  who  had  to  work  doubly  hard  during  critical periods of the pandemic, as well as those who had to serve on the frontlines. The true spirit of Sunway shone through in all their efforts, sacrifices and generosity during the pandemic. I am deeply humbled and immensely proud of all our 'Sunway Heroes'.\n\n69",

        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\n## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\n## DELIVERING SHARED SUSTAINABLE VALUE\n\nThis pandemic has tested our unity and strength, and has further reinforced our belief in the Sunway vision and mission, in the immense potential of this organisation that we have built together, and in the ability of our future leaders of the company to continue creating shared value for all of our stakeholders. We are all in this together, and only together will we prevail.\n\nAs a testament to our commitment to support our stakeholders in good times and bad, our our malls under the Property Investment division established a rental support programme to waive rental payments for affected tenants of Sunway's malls during the first 14 days of MCO 1.0, the first owner and mall operator in the country to make such a call. From the medium to longer term perspective, the decision was made on the principles of shared responsibility central to building trust among our stakeholders and nurturing sustainable relationships. In every business decision we make, we are guided by our core values of Integrity, Humility and Excellence - values that have stood us in good stead over the years, particularly in times of crises, and will continue to guide our way as we expand and grow the Sunway brand.\n\nThe Group recorded a decline in revenue of 19.9% from RM4.8 billion in FY 2019 to RM3.8 billion in FY 2020. Though most of our business segments recorded lower revenue in FY 2020, particularly the Hospitality and Leisure businesses under the Property Investment segment being the hardest hit, the Group's diverse businesses helped cushion the fallout. Profit after tax and minority interest ('PATMI') also suffered a temporary setback of 48.8% declining from RM709.2 million in FY 2019 to RM362.8 million in the current year caused by the pandemic and the resulting operations disruptions.\n\nThe adverse financial impact was cushioned by the recognition of the balance of the development profits from the Group's Rivercove Residences project in Singapore and Sunway Gardens project in Tianjin, China which were completed and successfully delivered in the last quarter of 2020 amounting to RM182.5 million.\n\nTo strengthen our capital base, we have embarked on a corporate exercise of a renounceable rights issue of Irredeemable Convertible Preference Shares ('ICPS') to issue up to 1,112,777,962 ICPS at an issue price of RM1.00 per ICPS on the basis of one ICPS for every five existing shares in Sunway Berhad. On 8 December 2020, we completed the corporate exercise successfully with the  listing  and  quotation  of  977,779,351  ICPS  and  39,555,548  additional Warrants on the Main Market of Bursa Securities. The gross proceeds raised from the Rights Issue of ICPS was approximately RM977.8 million. We believe the additional funds raised will provide the company with greater financial flexibility to seize any mergers and acquisitions ('M&A') opportunity arising from the pandemic.\n\nSubsequently, Sunway's warrants issued in FY 2017 as part of the Group's bonus issue corporate exercise were also adjusted accordingly. The warrants are subject to fixed annual step-down exercise price adjustments on each anniversary date. In FY 2020, the exercise price of the warrants after the fixed annual step-down exercise price adjustments and issuance of the ICPS was further reduced from RM1.72 to RM1.56.\n\nIn light of the challenging operating scenario for the Group in FY 2020, the Board declared a cash dividend of 1.50 sen per ordinary shares for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.  In addition, the Group has also declared a preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum (based on the issue price of RM1.00) per ICPS for the period from 3 December 2020 up to and including 31 December 2020. Rest assured, Sunway remains committed to delivering sustained returns for our shareholders and rewarding them for their continued support through these trying times. The Board believes it is prudent to ensure that we remain well-positioned financially to proactively respond to the emerging trends and challenges in the wake of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AT THE FOREFRONT OF DIGITALISATION\n\nOver the years, Sunway has invested significantly in digitalisation as a driver of growth in the Group, including efforts towards improving our  internal  business  and  operational  processes,  enhancing customer-facing initiatives, and implementing private cloud for the Group's shared services and big data analytics into our systems. Being at the forefront of digitalisation has helped Sunway stay ahead of the competition and market trends. This has enabled us to swiftly identify new opportunities within the sector such as the utilisation of robotic process automation.\n\nIn 2020, Sunway accelerated the pace of digital adoption in various business divisions, especially in engaging our customers, ensuring business  continuity,  and  exploring  new  channels  and  platforms that offer promising potential. In July 2020, Sunway entered into a tripartite collaboration with Celcom and Huawei towards advancing smart township solutions encompassing Internet of Things ('IoT') and Artificial Intelligence ('AI') using 5G technology in areas such as  public  safety  and  security,  telehealth,  e-learning,  hospitality, leisure and retail experience.\n\nWe also partnered with Ecole 42, a revolutionary French computer programming  school  that  offers  peer-to-peer  learning  with  zero tuition fees, to introduce Ecole 42 KL - a sister campus housed in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, that is set to produce a stream of digital talents with the skills and aptitude to meet the requirements of the 21 st century and thrive in the age of the New Normal.\n\nThese developments will further strengthen our lead at the forefront of the nation's urbanisation and digitalisation thrust, support our mission of nation building as well as advancing the sustainable development agenda in the Asian region.\n\n## SHAPING SMART SUSTAINABLE CITIES OF THE FUTURE\n\nBeyond financial performance and profits, Sunway embraces the principles of sustainability in all our decision-making processes and business practices. We pride ourselves as responsible stewards of the planet and custodians of today, promoting sustainable socioeconomic goals to ensure that future generations inherit a better tomorrow.\n\nThis vision is realised in part through Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, which has evolved over the years from a barren land of disused and  abandoned  tin  mining  pools,  into  one  of  Malaysia's  most iconic integrated township and a model smart sustainable city. It was  developed  with  all  the  fundamental  building  blocks  within the ecosystem, ensuring the township's ability to flourish into a sustainable integrated city with smart capabilities.\n\nSunway City Kuala Lumpur is set to be the launchpad for the smart township solutions and 5G technology collaboration. It is also a 'living laboratory' that serves to generate real-world, sustainable solutions for future urban spaces, led by our innovation arm, Sunway iLabs. Sunway iLabs has brought together researchers, experts and members of academia to generate and incubate ideas to address the challenges facing humanity that will be tested within the living ecosystem of Sunway City Kuala Lumpur towards the betterment of the environment and humankind.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUSINESS ACHIEVEMENTS AMIDST CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nSunway  achieved  encouraging  key  milestones despite the highly challenging landscape. Despite the subdued residential property market sentiment, total  new  property  launches  for  the  year  stood at  RM1.9  billion  and  the  Property  Development division logged new property sales of RM1.3 billion against a RM1.1 billion target.\n\nOur  Construction  division  secured  RM2.3  billion new  construction  orders,  outstripping  its  2020 target of RM2.0 billion. During the year, SunCon was  awarded  two  highway  construction  projects in  India  for  approximately  RM508.0  million  and RM315.0  million  respectively,  under  the  Hybrid Annuity Model ('HAM') approach. These projects marked SunCon's 8 th and 9 th highway projects in India to date since its maiden venture into India in 2001. Suncon's hallmark use of Virtual Design and Construction ('VDC') and Building Information Modelling  ('BIM')  had  also  led  to  one  of  its construction project, The Petronas New Leadership Centre, being first project in Malaysia and South East Asia certified by British Standards Institution ('BSI') with ISO 19650.\n\nI am pleased to inform that the Quarry division completed the acquisition of both Blacktop Industries Sdn Bhd and Dolomite Granite Quarry Sdn Bhd during the year. With the enlarged portfolio of quarries and asphalt plants, Sunway will be able to expand our market share in the quarry business.\n\nNotably, our Property Investment division successfully raised an additional RM450.0 million via the disposal of The Pinnacle Sunway to our associate, Sunway REIT.\n\nWe  continued  to  make  headway  in  our  robust expansion plan for our Healthcare division, which has been identified as one of the fastest growing divisions of the Group moving forward. In July 2020, Sunway acquired a leasehold land measuring 9.41 acres for RM28.7 million in Kota Bharu earmarked for  a  200-bed  hospital.  This  is  in  line  with  the division's overall strategy to expand its network of tertiary hospitals, in particular to locations where private healthcare is underserved. The expansion into Kota Bharu will be the Healthcare division's maiden expansion into the East Coast Region and will further add to its brand visibility as a provider of high quality healthcare services.\n\nIn  September  2020,  the  Group  has  appointed Maybank  Investment  Bank  Berhad  to  explore strategic  investment  options  for  its  healthcare portfolio,  in  line  with  the  Group's  objective  to enhance shareholders' value as the Group continues to explore and evaluate various options for all its businesses.\n\nThe Healthcare division has six new hospitals in the pipeline that will increase its capacity to more than 2,000 beds in the next six to seven years, reinforcing its position as the leading private healthcare provider in Malaysia.\n\nLaunch of FutureX Farm, our first step towards food security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong the initiatives launched in FY 2020 is the innovative Sunway FutureX Farm, which will be Malaysia's first-ever skills building hub for urban farming innovations and our inaugural venture into the agrifood-tech sector. It marks our first step in contributing to Malaysia's food security by establishing decentralised farms and production centres that are closer to where people live. This is an especially timely development given the need to address issues in global food supply chains amid the pandemic, which will help reduce the carbon footprint generated from the logistics of conventional food supply models.\n\nWe aim to replicate these smart sustainable initiatives across all our other townships, namely Sunway City Ipoh and Sunway City Iskandar Puteri in Johor, and lead the urban transformation agenda in this part of the world.\n\n## PRACTICING SUSTAINABILITY IN GOVERNANCE\n\nOur  commitment  to  sustainability  naturally  extends  to  how  we govern our organisation as well, leading by example through sound policies  espousing  anti-corruption,  health  and  safety,  workplace diversity, talent development, climate change mitigation and others. This is evidenced by our continued commitment to the adoption and advancement of the 17 UNSDG - a commitment that we have renewed in 2020 for another 5 years to 2025 through the extension of partnership between Jeffrey Cheah Foundation and United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network ('UNSDSN'). As part of our strategy for the Group's long-term success and economic value, we have aligned our material ESG issues with the UNSDGs, and have become among the first corporation in Malaysia to support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD').\n\nI am proud that Sunway City Kuala Lumpur has been selected as one of three overarching UNSDSN centres alongside New York and Paris, which will oversee continent-wide sustainability initiatives for Asia, the Americas, and Europe/Africa respectively. The UNSDSN centre for Asia housed at Sunway University will also host the head office of the SDG Academy, the education arm of the UNSDSN.\n\n71",

The COVID-19 vaccine rollouts across the world and the expected widespread vaccination by the end of 2021 offers hope that global travel restrictions will be eased, reducing the pandemic's impact on the economy. Policy makers remain committed to limiting the spill overs and will likely maintain the accommodative fiscal and monetary policies in 2021.\n\nAlthough uncertainties remain, Sunway is on a strong strategic footing  to  continue  weathering  the  storms  of  early  2021  while positioning ourselves to respond in the recovery landscape of latter 2021. The changes implemented in FY 2020 have strengthened the business models of our various divisions to be leaner, nimbler and cost efficient to tap the potentials of the new operating normal.\n\nOn a strategic level, we will continue to accelerate digitalisation as one of our key priorities, leveraging it to break physical divides and connect us with our target customers and markets. We see tremendous  potential  for  our  Property  Development  division  to continue  incorporating  smart  city  elements  to  leapfrog  Sunway City's status as a world class connected smart and sustainable city, strengthening our market position as a regional development leader. Technology will also be an enabler to help us harness and integrate the synergies of our business divisions, with investments channelled to  build  on  our  digital  infrastructure  and  provide  employees training to familiarise them with new systems while we pursue new opportunities in both the digital and analogue spheres.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving environment, Sunway will continue reinventing our existing businesses as we respond to shifts in global megatrends reshaping the economy and market demand. We are keen to explore new business ventures in emerging areas of the industries where we operate, such as co-living and rent-to-own schemes for our Property Development division and Industrialised Building Systems for our Construction division, as well as forays into new sectors such as fintech.\n\nWe remain  highly committed to continuously strengthen synergies of  our  diversified  businesses,  supporting  each  other  through information,  talent  and  knowledge  sharing  as  well  as  strategic collaborations that have served us well through the recent challenges, and we look forward to continue uncovering such opportunities in the future.\n\nFor over four decades, Sunway has proven that our fundamentals are strong and we as a Group live by the values and tenets we espouse. We are well prepared, well placed and well managed to capitalise on emerging growth opportunities as the world begins its recovery from this pandemic. We are definitely expecting exciting times ahead of us and I am pleased to have you with us in realising these goals.\n\nIn closing, I would like to express my appreciation to my fellow Board members, the management teams and our employees, for their tremendous efforts and contribution during this difficult time. As a Group, we are also grateful to our customers, shareholders, investors, financiers, business partners, suppliers and government authorities, for their continued support.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mr. Wong Chin Mun, for his invaluable contribution as a member of this Board. He has retired as our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director after 9 years of cumulative service. In his place, we have welcomed Datuk Tong Poh Keow as the new Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, who brings a wealth of industry experience to advise the Group through our next course of growth. We are also pleased to welcome Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim, who has joined the Board of Sunway as Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 3 March 2021. He has more than 40 years of experience especially in the field of information technology and telecommunications which is crucial to propel Sunway towards the new digital space.\n\nWith a solid foundation, robust strategy and dynamic team as the driving force of Sunway, we are poised to respond, reinvent and lead the region towards an era of recovery and sustainability, together with you!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTAN SRI DATO' SERI DR JEFFREY CHEAH FOOK LING AO EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\n\n## RECOGNITION FOR OUR CONTRIBUTION TO PROGRESS\n\nI am pleased to see our flagship Property Development division bring home the Best Overall Champion and Exceptional Community Builder recognitions in the StarProperty All-Stars Award category, as well as seven other excellence and honour awards for its property projects at The Star Property Awards 2020.\n\nSunway's Property Development division was also one of the winners in the Top Property Developers Awards and Best in Qualitative Attributes sub-award at The Edge Malaysia Property Excellence Awards  2020.  Our  leadership  in  the  property  sector  is  further cemented by Sunway Property Managing Director Sarena Cheah's recognition as the 2020 Malaysia Real Estate Personality of the Year, the first woman to receive the honour.\n\nRepresenting Sunway's Healthcare division, Sunway Medical Centre has emerged as the exclusive titleholder for Medical Tourism Hospital of the Year in Asia Pacific at the Global Health and Travel Asia Pacific Healthcare & Medical Tourism Award 2020. The division continues to be recognised in various fields of specialisation having received numerous accolades at the same award event for Fertility Hospital of the Year, Oncology (Surgical) Service Provider of the Year and Paediatric Ophthalmology Service Provider of the Year. Our Sunway Specialist Centre Damansara, which only opened in 2019, received Ambulatory Medical Centre of the Year award, demonstrating our expertise in providing quality healthcare.\n\nOur incessant efforts towards helping our community have culminated in Sunway clinching the CSR Malaysia Awards 2020, in the Company of the Year (Industrial Product and Services) category. The award aims to honour outstanding corporations that have excelled in their role as change agents towards the socio-economic transformation of the country. This award is endorsed by the national sustainability body Pertubuhan Amal Tanggungjawab Kemapanan and Korporat Malaysia (The  Welfare  Society  for  Corporate  Responsibility  and Sustainability Malaysia).\n\nSunway Berhad has also remained as a constituent of FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index for demonstrating good environmental, social and governance practices since the launch of the index in 2014. In addition, Sunway Berhad is ranked first for the Best Investor Relations category, third in the Most Committed to Social Causes category, and third in the Best Managed Company category in FinanceAsia's 2020 Asia's Best Companies Survey.\n\nOn a personal level, I am deeply humbled to be conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Social Enterprise by University of Cambodia, and becoming the first non-Muslim recipient of the Hunayn Ibn Ishaq Unity Award at the Islamic Excellence Awards 1441H/2020AD. I dedicate  these  accomplishments  to  all  Sunwayians,  whose dedication and commitment to realise our vision and mission have made this possible.",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSunway Berhad is one of the leading conglomerates in Malaysia with  a  portfolio  of  synergistic  businesses,  including  Property Development,  Property  Investment,  REIT,  Leisure,  Hospitality, Construction, Healthcare, Trading and Manufacturing, Quarry and Building Materials.\n\nFY 2020 has been a challenging year for the Group. The COVID-19 pandemic, its resulting MCO, CMCO and RMCO enforced by the Government to contain the spread of COVID-19 since 18 March 2020 have caused significant disruptions and financial impact to the Group's operations, particularly on the Leisure and Hospitality divisions which were either not allowed to operate during these periods  or  could  only  operate  under  stringent  social  distancing environment.\n\nAll our business operations were suspended during MCO except for the healthcare and the mall operations which provided limited activities to cater to retail tenants offering essential products and services. Although most of the other businesses of the Group have resumed operations during the CMCO and RMCO from 4 May 2020, the recovery rates of our business segments were varied due to the different adaptations and compliance requirements imposed by the authorities for the different economic sectors. The performance of the various businesses of the Group is discussed below.\n\n## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## Group Financial Performance\n\nThe Group recorded revenue of RM3,829.1 million and profit before tax of RM512.5 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM4,780.3 million and profit before tax of RM865.3 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 19.9% and profit before tax of 40.8%. Revenue in the current year was lower due to lower contributions from most business segments except Healthcare division.\n\nProfit before tax was lower due to lower profit contributions from most business segments except Property Development and Others divisions. It should be noted that the balance of the development profits  on  one  of  the  Group's  Singapore  and  China  property development projects, which were earlier deferred due to adoption of MFRS 15, were recognised in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring the current financial year, following the reassessment of the Group's involvement in its investments in wholesale funds, the Group determined that its placement in wholesale funds are in substance, structured entities under its control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Accordingly,  the  Group  has consolidated these wholesale funds in the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 and the Group has restated its comparatives via prior year adjustments retrospectively.\n\nAs a result of the abovementioned reassessment, the Group is in a net current liabilities position of RM883.7 million as at 31 December 2020. However, the Group has significant positive cash flows from its overall business operations and has adequate undrawn credit facilities available to meet its operational and funding requirements. As the net current liabilities position is mainly due to the short term bank borrowings, the Group plans to reduce its quantum and refinance it with longer term bank loans and longer dated corporate bonds in the near term.\n\n## Segmental Financial Performance\n\n## Property Development\n\nThe Property Development division reported revenue of RM494.6 million and profit before tax of RM296.9 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM545.9 million and profit before tax of RM228.5 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 9.4% and increase in profit before tax of 29.9%.\n\nThe lower revenue for the current year was mainly due to lower sales and progress billings from local development projects, which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, profit before tax for the current year was higher due to the full recognition of the balance of the development profits on one of the Group's Singapore and China property development projects which amounted to RM182.5 million and a gain on land disposal of RM7.7 million in the fourth quarter of FY 2020.\n\n## Property Investment\n\nThe Property Investment division reported revenue of RM330.1 million and loss before tax of RM27.4 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM803.5 million and profit before tax of RM323.1 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 58.9% and higher loss before tax of 108.5%.\n\nThe MCO which commenced from 18 March 2020 has adversely impacted the Group's hospitality and leisure businesses, as well as our associate, Sunway REIT's rental income from its retail segment. The resulting adverse financial impact from the disruptions of the business  operations  were  compounded  by  higher  share  of  fair value loss from the revaluation of Sunway REIT properties and our investment properties. The fair value loss from the revaluation exercise  was  however,  largely  offset  by  a  remeasurement  gain of leases as per MFRS 16 and disposal gain from the sale of The Pinnacle Sunway building. Further, it should be noted that the profit before tax of the previous financial year recorded a disposal gain of Sunway University assets of RM37.7 million.\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Construction division reported revenue of RM990.2 million and profit before tax of RM105.1 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM1,273.3 million and profit before tax of RM162.3 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 22.2% and profit before tax of 35.3%. The financial performance in the current year was lower due to lower progress billings caused by stop work orders by the authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNotwithstanding, the division closed the year with an order book replenishment of RM2.3 billion and an outstanding order book of RM5.1 billion.\n\n## Healthcare\n\nThe Healthcare division reported revenue of RM620.3 million and profit before tax of RM17.4 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM584.8 million and profit before tax of RM61.5 million in FY 2019, representing an increase in revenue of 6.1% and decrease in profit before tax of 71.7%. Revenue in the current year was higher due to higher contribution from Sunway Medical Centre Velocity which commenced operations in September 2019. Profit before tax in the current year was lower mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a sharp drop in the number of admissions and outpatient treatments at Sunway Medical Centre during the first half of FY 2020. However, it should be noted that the performance of both Sunway Medical Centre and Sunway Medical Centre Velocity recovered steadily in the second half when more patients resumed their visits to seek medical treatments from the hospitals.\n\n|                                                                                    | REVENUE (RM'000)   | REVENUE (RM'000)   | PROFIT/(LOSS) BEFORE TAX  (RM'000)   | PROFIT/(LOSS) BEFORE TAX  (RM'000)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                    | 2020               | 2019               | 2020                                 | 2019                                 |\n|                                                                                    |                    | (Restated)         |                                      | (Restated)                           |\n| Property Development                                                               | 494,623            | 545,852            | 296,943                              | 228,526                              |\n| Property Investment (comprises Property Investment, REIT, Leisure and Hospitality) | 330,147            | 803,468            | (27,432)                             | 323,118                              |\n| Construction                                                                       | 990,225            | 1,273,269          | 105,076                              | 162,331                              |\n| Healthcare                                                                         | 620,302            | 584,833            | 17,405                               | 61,491                               |\n| Trading and Manufacturing                                                          | 812,079            | 959,762            | 24,481                               | 30,022                               |\n| Quarry                                                                             | 321,389            | 348,114            | 14,777                               | 16,134                               |\n| Building Materials                                                                 | 135,717            | 166,657            | 7,338                                | (27,419)                             |\n| Others                                                                             | 124,579            | 98,324             | 73,957                               | 71,120                               |\n| Total                                                                              | 3,829,061          | 4,780,279          | 512,545                              | 865,323                              |\n\n## Trading and Manufacturing\n\nThe  Trading  and  Manufacturing  division  reported  revenue  of RM812.1 million and profit before tax of RM24.5 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM959.8 million and profit before tax of RM30.0 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 15.4% and profit before tax of 18.5%. The financial performance was lower in the current year mainly due to lower sales amidst the challenging market conditions and the suspended operation during the earlier MCO period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Quarry\n\nThe Quarry division reported revenue of RM321.4 million and profit before tax of RM14.8 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM348.1 million and profit before tax of RM16.1 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 7.7% and profit before tax of 8.4%. The financial performance of this division was lower mainly due to the disruptions caused by the MCO. Further, the profit before tax was impacted by a fair value loss on revaluation of a piece of quarry land of RM2.2 million in the fourth quarter of FY 2020.\n\n## Building Materials\n\nThe Building Materials division reported revenue of RM135.7 million and profit before tax of RM7.3 million in FY 2020 compared to revenue of RM166.7 million and loss before tax of RM27.4 million in FY 2019, representing a decrease in revenue of 18.6% and increase in profit before tax of 126.8%. The revenue of the division was lower mainly due to disruptions caused by the MCO which resulted in lower sales volume for its products. It should be noted that the profit before tax in the previous year recorded a provision for impairment of assets of RM36.4 million for its spun pile operation under MFRS 136: Impairment of Assets.\n\n## STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\nThe Group's total borrowings decreased from RM8.3 billion in FY 2019 to RM7.5 billion in FY 2020. Cash and bank balances also experienced a decline from RM2.6 billion in FY 2019 to RM2.2 billion in FY 2020. As a result, net borrowings in FY 2020 was RM5.3 billion, which is lower than the net borrowings in FY 2019 of RM5.7 billion.\n\nTotal assets decreased slightly from RM21.5 billion in FY 2019 to RM21.1 billion in FY 2020. This was mainly attributable to the decrease in cash and bank balances and receivables.\n\nShare capital increased to RM6.4 billion in FY 2020 compared to the previous financial year of RM5.4 billion. The increase was due to the issuance of 977,779,351 Irredeemable Convertible Preference Shares ('ICPS') pursuant to the completion of ICPS exercise during\n\nthe year. The gross proceeds raised from the rights issue of ICPS was approximately RM977.8 million of which RM597.0 million was utilised for the repayment of borrowings.\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities was RM777.2 million in FY 2020 compared to RM689.0 million generated in FY 2019. The amount generated from operating activities in FY 2020 was higher mainly due to decrease in cash utilised for working capital purposes for the year.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nThe Group utilised RM826.4 million for investing activities in FY 2020 compared to RM1,359.9 million in FY 2019. The amount utilised in the current year was lower mainly due to higher proceeds from disposal of investment properties and other investments, lower acquisition of investment properties and investment properties under construction and lower advances to associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash from financing activities decreased from an inflow of RM499.0 million in FY 2019 to an outflow of RM134.3 million in FY 2020. This was mainly due to lower overall net borrowings and funding from financial institutions and the local bond market, offset by the gross proceeds raised from the rights issue of ICPS and issuance of perpetual sukuk of RM200.0 million in FY 2020.\n\nHence, as at 31 December 2020, cash and cash equivalents of Sunway stood at RM2.2 billion, a decrease from the preceding year's balance of RM2.4 billion.\n\n## DIVIDENDS DECLARED\n\nThe Group declared a first interim cash dividend for FY 2020 of 1.5 sen per share to be distributed in April 2021. In addition, a preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum based on the issue price of RM1.00 per ICPS, for the period from 3 December 2020 (being the issue date) up to and including 31 December 2020 was also declared.\n\nThe lower dividend paid in FY 2020 is to provide a greater margin of safety to ensure the sustainability of Sunway's cash flow in line with reduced profits for the year and the continued uncertainty of the global economic outlook caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Group remains committed to providing reliable returns to its shareholders, who are the bedrock of Sunway's sustained success.\n\n75",

The diversified funding mix and a well-balanced borrowing profile in terms of maturity serves to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks. This is overseen by Sunway's centralised treasury operation that actively monitors and manages these risks and the Group's hedging strategies.\n\nThis includes entering into cross currency swap contracts when the financing terms are favourable to manage the Group's exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings, while taking advantage of lower effective interest rates compared to local Ringgit borrowing rates. The Group's interest rate exposures are reviewed periodically to ensure an optimal mix of fixed and floating rate borrowing is achieved.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Group remains cognisant of its risk factors and continues to closely  monitor  its  various  financial,  business,  operational  and strategic risks. The Group has developed effective mitigation action plans for each of these identified risks as part of its comprehensive approach towards risk management.\n\nThe Group's risk management framework is benchmarked against the ISO31000:2018 Risk Management - Guidelines and is designed to embed Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') into key activities, initiatives and processes of the Group. This enables the Group to identify, evaluate, mitigate and monitor risks that may prevent the Group from achieving its objectives. In doing so, the stakeholders are assured that their interest is protected.\n\nFor further information on the Group's risk management structure and processes, kindly refer to the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control on pages 154 to 158 of this IAR2020. For strategic information on identified risks, mitigation plans and the linkage between strategies and risks, please refer to Our Strategy section on pages 36 to 66 of this IAR2020.\n\nMalaysian  Rating  Corporation  Berhad  ('MARC')  performed  an annual  review  on  the  credit  rating  of  the  Group's  private  debt securities  programmes  during  the  year.  In  recognition  of  the Group's financial strength, the credit rating assigned by MARC was maintained at MARC-1/AA-, with a stable ratings outlook in view of the current challenging economic conditions.\n\n| RM MILLION                  | FY 2020   | FY 2019 (Restated)   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Gross borrowings            | 7,511.8   | 8,298.6              |\n| Cash and bank balances      | 2,238.4   | 2,554.7              |\n| Net borrowings              | 5,273.4   | 5,743.8              |\n| Gross gearing ratio (times) | 0.73      | 0.88                 |\n| Net gearing ratio (times) * | 0.51      | 0.61                 |\n| Shareholders' fund          | 9,540.7   | 8,389.3              |\n| Net assets per share (sen)  | 193.37    | 170.03               |\n\n- * Net gearing ratio calculations exclude cross currency swap.\n\nFIXED VS FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS\n\nSOURCES OF BORROWINGS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATIONS REVIEW\n\nThe key indicators for each division, tracked over the last five years, are illustrated in the table below:\n\n|                                          | 2020          | 2019          | 2018          | 2017          | 2016         |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Property Development                     |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Launches                                 | RM1.9 bil     | RM1.2 bil     | RM2.1 bil     | RM1.1 bil     | RM650 mil    |\n| Sales                                    | RM1.3 bil     | RM1.6 bil     | RM1.9 bil     | RM1.2 bil     | RM1.2 bil    |\n| Unbilled Sales                           | RM2.4 bil     | RM2.7 bil     | RM2.1 bil     | RM1.0 bil     | RM1.5 bil    |\n| Landbank                                 | 3,328 acres   | 3,347 acres   | 3,283 acres   | 3,305 acres   | 3,292 acres  |\n| Property Investment and REIT             |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Assets Under Management                  | RM10.9 bil    | RM10.7 bil    | RM9.9 bil     | RM9.4 bil     | RM8.8 bil    |\n| Total Net Lettable Area                  | 11.6 mil sqft | 11.3 mil sqft | 10.2 mil sqft | 10.0 mil sqft | 9.3 mil sqft |\n| Leisure                                  |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Total Park Size                          | 128 acres     | 128 acres     | 128 acres     | 128 acres     | 128 acres    |\n| Visitorship                              | 0.6 mil       | 2.5 mil       | 2.4 mil       | 2.3 mil       | 2.2 mil      |\n| Hospitality                              |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Number of Hotels and Resorts Managed     | 11            | 11            | 11            | 11            | 10           |\n| Number of Guestrooms                     | 3,424         | 3,386         | 3,386         | 3,386         | 3,017        |\n| Construction                             |               |               |               |               |              |\n| New Contracts Secured                    | RM2.3 bil     | RM1.8 bil     | RM1.6 bil     | RM4.0 bil     | RM2.7 bil    |\n| Outstanding Order Book                   | RM5.1 bil     | RM5.2 bil     | RM5.2 bil     | RM6.1 bil     | RM4.8 bil    |\n| Healthcare                               |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Number of Specialist Consultation Suites | 237           | 226           | 180           | 180           | 130          |\n| Number of Operating Theatres             | 19            | 17            | 12            | 12            | 12           |\n| Number of Beds                           | 740           | 741           | 636           | 533           | 373          |\n| Trading and Manufacturing                |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Regional Presence                        | 7 countries   | 7 countries   | 6 countries   | 6 countries   | 6 countries  |\n| Agency Lines                             | 191           | 181           | 168           | 150           | 154          |\n| Quarry                                   |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Number of Quarries                       | 9             | 8             | 6             | 6             | 8            |\n| Number of Asphalt Plants                 | 24            | 24            | 13            | 13            | 12           |\n| Building Materials                       |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Number of Manufacturing Facilities       | 9             | 9             | 8             | 7             | 7            |\n\n77",

This has prompted potential purchasers to be critically selective over the properties available or some may even defer high-value expenditures such as property purchase due to the economic uncertainty.\n\nThis is compounded by existing challenges in the property market, such  as  the  high  property  overhang  in  Malaysia,  change  in government policies on foreigner thresholds, difficulty in securing mortgage  loans  albeit  the  lower  interest  rates,  and  increasing preference among younger population to rent over purchasing a property.\n\nTo incentivise property sales among locals, the government has extended  the  Home  Ownership  Campaign  ('HOC')  to  31  May 2021 as part of the nation's Short-Term Economic Recovery Plan ('PENJANA') to stimulate the nation's economy. Benefits include full stamp duty exemption up to RM1 million and partial exemption up to RM2.5 million, and further stamp duty exemption on the Instrument of Securing Loan. Buyers also enjoy a minimum 10% reduction on the listed property price for eligible properties under this scheme.\n\nIn terms of trends in the industry, there is a growing preference for  Malaysians  to  live  in  transit-oriented  developments  ('TOD') and  integrated  developments  to  reduce  carbon  footprint.  This has increased the competition for landbanks within established neighbourhoods and/or near public transportation amenities like MRT/LRT.\n\nThe younger population of buyers are also more comfortable with technological changes, which sees the corresponding increased adoption of virtual sales galleries and show units among developers. The emergence of online platforms to help property owners lease and manage their properties goes hand in hand with the changing preferences of this demographic.\n\nSunway House Waterfront Residence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nThe division responded to the challenges of 2020 with perseverance and innovation, leveraging on the strengths of its synergistic property value chain and sustainability-driven brand positioning.\n\nAlthough sales were impacted as a result of the economic downturn and soft market sentiment, and the closure of sales galleries during the  MCO,  the  division  responded  by  leveraging  its  established digital infrastructure to interact with potential customers virtually and deploying innovative digital marketing and home ownership campaigns  to  secure  sales.  Customers  were  able  to  view  and examine the properties in virtual 360\u00b0 tours of the show units hosted on the division's websites, while Facebook Live and chatbots on its websites helped the team address customers' queries virtually.\n\nSunway's Property Development division also launched the 'Always With You' digital campaign towards the end of April 2020 until June 2020 in response to feedback from people who were keen to own a home but were hesitant and cautious due to the uncertain economic conditions. Perks of the campaign included:\n\nVoluntary exit plan (option to exit the purchase contract in the event of loss of employment, disability or critical illness)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see pages 54 to 55 for more information on the Property Development division's strategic profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe campaign was successful in securing RM200 million online bookings during the lockdown period which is a testament to the reputation and trust built by Sunway Property Development division over the years. With the success of the 'Always With You' campaign and extension of the Home Ownership Campaign ('HOC') by the Government, Sunway Property Development division extended its irresistible deals with 'Always With You 2.0' campaign until 31 August 2020 which garnered additional RM213 million bookings.\n\nOperationally, the division's construction progress was affected due to the lockdowns and implementation of social distancing measures at construction sites, leading to some delays for launches and revenue recognition of ongoing projects in Malaysia. Property launches were also scaled and staggered to reflect the change in market appetite due to the downturn. Launches delayed in 2020 have been carried forward to early 2021, with new launches in 2021 focusing mainly on TODs within close proximity to amenities like retail, education and healthcare.\n\nWhile the lockdown was in effect, the division focused its efforts on planning to ensure that progress can be expedited once MCO is lifted, allowing the division to catch up on construction progress. With the inevitable slowdown in construction affecting operational cost and sales for the year, the division has reduced its non-essential expenses  and  placed  greater  emphasis  on  cost  containment measures in 2020.\n\nUnbilled sales stood at RM2.4 billion as at 31 December 2020 which provides earnings visibility for the division, while the division has 3,328 acres of landbank remaining for future development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nIn 2020, the division has successfully completed and handed over 1,783 units for vacant possession, bringing the cumulative number of delivered units to over 31,000 to-date. Included in the units completed and handed over for vacant possession are  the  Rivercove  Residences  executive  condominium  in Singapore  and  Sunway  Gardens  condominiums  Phase  2 in China, which has helped to boost the performance of the Property Development division for the year.\n\nKey launches in 2020 include Sunway Velocity TWO Tower C in Malaysia, Parc Canberra and Ki Residences in Singapore, with a total GDV of RM1.9 billion. All three projects are expected to be completed in 2023. Take-up rates of these new properties have  been  varied.  For  Parc  Canberra  in  Singapore  which was launched in February 2020, the executive condominium received an impressive 90% take up as at end of 2020. For Sunway Velocity TWO Tower C Kuala Lumpur and Ki Residence Singapore which was only launched towards the end of the year, their take up rates were encouraging at 40% and 28% respectively. The launches for the year reflect the division's business diversification strategy to expand its portfolio and geographic range as a means to diversify revenue streams. Total sales secured for the year amounted to RM1.3 billion.\n\nThe division also unveiled its first Rent-to-Buy scheme via a co-living product to tap on the trend of renters and create a pipeline of potential Sunway's property purchasers. Located in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, Co-living @ Sunway House Waterfront Residence offers the best of both worlds with its Rent-to-Buy proposition, where 25% of the residents' rental are accumulated as Rent-to-Buy credits which can be used as down payment to purchase a Sunway's property of their choice in the future.\n\nOn  the  awards  front,  2020  was  another  successful  year for the Group's Property Development division, securing 9 recognitions  in  the  StarProperty  Awards  2020  and  various accolades for its properties as well as corporate, sustainability and  leadership  achievements.  Significantly,  the  division continued to rank amongst the Top 3 developers in Malaysia at The Edge Malaysia's Top Property Developer Awards 2020 and garnering recognition for being the Best in Qualitative attributes developer, which takes into account the division's product quality, innovation, value creation, image and expertise.",

        "page_content": "80\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nBarring a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and further lockdowns, the management is of the opinion that 2021 will be a better year for the division than 2020. The expected rebound of the economy, coupled with the Government's re-initiation of the HOC scheme and the timely PENJANA initiatives, will likely drive the return of property sales volume closer to pre-pandemic level. The demand will be further supported by the low interest rate regime. However, affordability factor continues to be a top priority in homebuyers' mind.\n\nIn line with this outlook, the division has planned 6 exciting property launches for 2021 across Malaysia, Singapore and China with a total GDV of RM2.8 billion.\n\nIn Malaysia, the property launches comprise a mix of developments in prime locations such as Sunway Belfield in Kuala Lumpur, TransitOriented Development like Sunway ARTESSA in Wangsa Maju, leafy suburb like Sunway D'Hill in Kota Damansara, and affordable homes like Jernih Residence @ Kajang, that will cater to every segment of Malaysian property buyers. The launches will be supported with more digital initiatives such as a unified Sunway Property application, virtual show units and the use of social media channels such as Facebook Live to drive sales.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  recent  launch  of  Parc  Central  Residences,  an executive  condominium  in  January  2021  has  garnered  strong interests which saw close to 60% of the units sold at launch, given the relatively resilient property market in Singapore.\n\nThe division also plans to launch its Phase 3 of Sunway Gardens residential property project in Tianjin, China in 2021 after successfully winning the tender to acquire the leasehold land in September 2019. The project which consists of seven blocks of condominiums has a GDV of more than RM780 million.\n\nGoing forward, Sunway's Property Development division is exploring further diversification of its product offerings, such as new coliving  products  and  rent-to-buy  schemes  to  cater  to  changing customer needs and trends in the property market, and exploring new sectors like industrial, which is seeing an increase in demand riding on the booming e-commerce. Landbank-wise, the division plans to rebalance its landbank profile by divesting non-core land and acquiring new fast turnaround landbank to complement its existing township landbank. The division will continue to improve its speed to market through product standardisation, and leveraging on better customer data analytics and understanding of customer expectations to tailor its product offering such as supporting chic and modern lifestyles, being close to amenities like cafes and retail; and promoting healthy and active lifestyle while being located near green lungs.\n\n## PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND REIT\n\nSunway Velocity Kuala Lumpur\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe Property Investment and REIT division experienced a challenging year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail segment was adversely affected by the implementation of MCO and CMCO. According to figures by Retail Group Malaysia, 2020 had been the worst period for retailers in Malaysia since 1987. The industry suffered a decline of 16.3% in 2020, being the worst performance in the last two decades.  Encouraging  recovery  was  evident  during  the  RMCO stage, however it was short lived due to reinstatement of CMCO in October 2020. Despite the difficult operating landscape, retail malls within the Property Investment and REIT division demonstrated high resilience in maintaining healthy average occupancy rates.\n\nThe commercial segment on the other hand, though challenging, was largely stable. Economic headwinds led to the deferment of tenants' expansion plans as well as consolidation in business operations. The average occupancy rate within the office portfolio of the Group was well supported by the vibrancy and synergistic benefits of the townships which are located in strategic TOD locations.\n\nThe division continued to operate under stringent standard operating procedures to ensure the safety of all stakeholders. Against the backdrop of reduced rental income for the year, the division was also faced with higher operating costs due to implementation of preventive measures and high level of sanitisation on premises. The higher cost was partially mitigated by lower utility cost during the year due to lower utilisation of the premises during MCO and CMCO.\n\nTechnological  adaptation  has  leapfrogged  due  to  consumer behavioural change since the implementation of MCO in March 2020. In the absence of physical presence, technological disruption platforms such as online retailing and video conferencing platforms have gained prominence. In the commercial segment, workingfrom-home experience has led to organisations rethinking of the future of office space requirements which may potentially lead to higher  demand  for  collaborative  office  space.  These  consumer behavioural change presents opportunities to Sunway's malls and offices to evolve along with these emerging trends.\n\nArtist's impression of Sunway ARTESSA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, the division contends with cumulative supply of retail and office spaces in the Klang Valley as at 2H 2020 1 at approximately 62.44 milion square feet and 109.5 million square feet respectively. In order to avoid being homogenous in the products and services offerings, malls owners need to create differentiation in the tenancy mix to appeal to consumers and establish its niche to capture the relevant market share. In the office segment, the oversupply situation is exacerbated by lack of FDI in Malaysia. Despite that, the  commercial  segment  presents  pockets  of  opportunities  in strategically located integrated townships and TODs.\n\nGovernment fiscal initiatives provided under the Economic Stimulus Package, various PRIHATIN packages, as well as the Economic Recovery Plan, have provided a degree of relief for the industry, subsidising wages for affected tenants and making available more disposable income to stimulate the retail market. These measures, coupled with the transition towards a relaxation of restrictions in the RMCO, have contributed to a gradual recovery for retail malls in the second half of 2020, which reversed upon the resurgence of COVID-19 in the final quarter.\n\nOVER 82 MEASURES FOR PANDEMIC PREVENTION INTRODUCED UNDER SUNWAY'S MALLS' 'YOUR SAFE SPACE, OUR SAFE SPACE' CAMPAIGN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n81",

This includes frequent sanitisation, increased disinfection of frequently touched surfaces, installation of hand sanitisation dispensers, installation of temperature thermal scanners and increased fresh air intake. Stringent social distancing measures, holistic education and training for all employees and tenants, and enhanced screening and safety checks were also carried out.\n\nIn total, over 82 measures have been put in place under Sunway's malls' 'Your Safe Space, Our Safe Space' campaign to inculcate confidence amongst tenants, employees and shoppers to stay, work and shop at Sunway's malls. The measures are necessary not just to protect lives, but to minimise the risk of transmission on premises and  strengthen  confidence  in  Sunway's  facilities  management capabilities.\n\nSunway's Property Investment and REIT division focused its efforts on  various  cost  containment  measures  to  counter  the  negative impact on its bottom line by revisiting agreements with the vendors and  optimising  energy  consumption  for  common  area  lightings and air-conditioning during low periods of building occupancy. The division also took this opportunity to reassess and deferred noncritical asset enhancement initiatives, repairs and maintenance to preserve cash flow to face an unprecedented economic situation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother key thrust of the division for the year is to manage tenants' attrition, thereby ensuring a strong relationship with tenants and sustainable business continuity as it continues to grow its asset portfolio  over  the  longer  run.  Sunway's  malls  have  committed to  support  its  tenants  during  the  difficult  period  through  the establishment of a rental and marketing assistance programme. Besides offering a 14-day rent-free during the first MCO period for all Sunway's malls, additional support for retail tenants were considered and granted on a case-to-case and needs-basis.\n\nIn an environment of subdued retail businesses, marketing and promotional activities were also ramped up to drive footfall and sales for retailers, with the introduction of additional shoppers' programme and incentives to stimulate consumer spending and safeguard the businesses of Sunway's retail partners.\n\nFor  the  commercial  spaces,  the  facilities  management  team proactively engaged its tenants and also seek to diversify its office tenant's profile across different business sectors to cushion against sectoral economic impact and reduce tenant's concentration risk.\n\nSunway  REIT  continued  to  pursue  its  diversification  strategy  to capitalise on emerging sectors opportunities while reducing the risk of its asset portfolio and lessening the focus on assets in COVID-19 affected sectors. To that end, Sunway REIT has accelerated into segments that generate steady recurring income stream. It aims to diversify up to 25% of the trust's total asset value into sunrise assets such as logistics warehouses and industrial properties, which has remained resilient despite the cyclical nature of the industry, as well as education, healthcare, e-commerce and data centres.\n\nPlease see pages 56 to 57 for more information on Property Investment and REIT division's strategic profiles.\n\nThe Pinnacle Sunway\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n## RETAIL SEGMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway's malls came together for the year 2020 to manage the pandemic together. It's the first mall operator in Malaysia to offer up to RM20 million 14-day rent-free to retailers providing non-essential products and services for the first MCO period in March 2020, providing relief for tenants operating in Sunway Pyramid Mall, Sunway Velocity Mall, Sunway Carnival Mall, Sunway Putra Mall, Sunway Big Box Retail Park, Sunway Giza Mall and Sunway Citrine Hub.\n\nThe division's malls also announced a flexible operating hours option for its retail tenants, allowing for better optimisation of human resource management to enable its retailers to contain operating costs amidst low footfall in the malls.\n\nTo  assist  its  retail  tenants  in  marketing  and  promotional activities, an online mall platform was established to facilitate its retailers to continue to operate during MCO especially for the smaller retailers, while providing a safer, more secure avenue for its customers. An 'Order and Collect' station was also set up outside the malls, where customers can call their favourite participating vendors to place their orders and collect it at the designated drive-through pickup point without having to enter the mall, keeping contact at the bare minimum.\n\nOrder and Collect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe marketing and promotional campaigns continued throughout 2020 to generate activities and publicity for the malls. This includes social media marketing and online sales events  organised  to  stimulate  consumer  spending.  Sunway Pyramid held its first 72-hours flash sales in May 2020 while Sunway Velocity Mall held its first-ever interactive Facebook live event on New Year's Eve, where shoppers can redeem up to RM32,000 instant cash rebates, as well as prizes, gifts and vouchers worth up to RM20,000 during the live sessions.\n\nOn  top  of  that, Sunway's  malls  also  introduced  the #kitasupportkita campaign where a total of RM500,000 worth of retail vouchers were distributed to Sunway's malls' 12,000 retail frontliners, to be redeemed at the retailers' respective stores as a gesture of appreciation for their continued hard work in serving customers during these challenging times.\n\nAs  a  leading  retail  player  in  Malaysia,  Sunway's  malls championed industry thought leader initiatives to discuss and strive to address key issues confronting the retail industry.\n\nIn May 2020, a Facebook Live virtual roundtable discussion was initiated with its business partners to discuss industry best practices in managing safety and hygiene measures to ensure safety of the public and regain shoppers' confidence to embrace new retail experience under the new normal. The video was well received, garnering over 21.4k views in a week. Another video of the re-opening of Sunway's malls under 'Your Safe Space, Our Safe Space' campaign, garnered over 2 million views collectively on Facebook.\n\nSynergistic efforts to drive commercial sales with Sunway's other business divisions, such as the 'Ke Sana Ke Sini Ke Sunway' staycation campaign, which was held at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur in collaboration with Sunway Pyramid Hotel, Sunway Clio Hotel and Sunway Lagoon, as well as the 'Stay, Screen, Shop' promotion at Sunway Velocity offering a staycation, health screening and retail therapy package at Sunway Velocity's hotel, medical centre and mall respectively, were well received.\n\nThe proactive and innovative measures to assist retailers' sales during the highly challenging pandemic year helped Sunway's malls achieved an average occupancy rate of 93%. During the year, Sunway's malls located in 7 locations across Klang Valley, Penang and Johor attracted 200 new outlets opening across its malls, driven by demand from acceleration of growing Asian retail brands presence in Malaysia.\n\nThe successful roll out of the License Plate Recognition system in tandem with Group-wide digitalisation initiatives has turned Sunway  Pyramid's  car  park  into  a  ticketless  and  cashless experience, placing Sunway's malls at the forefront of the retail evolution.\n\n## COMMERCIAL SEGMENT\n\nSunway's commercial portfolio continues to appeal to its tenants. Menara Sunway has achieved a 99% occupancy rate, while The Pinnacle Sunway secured 100% occupancy. Sunway Visio Tower which was launched in 2019 achieved 66% occupancy rate, with 34% of the occupancies secured in FY 2020. Leasing activities for V Office Tower is still ongoing at a commendable pace given the current economic environment.\n\nIn  the  last  quarter  of  2020,  Sunway  Monash-U  Residence 2,  a  20-storey  and  an  8-storey  blocks  of  student  hostels were completed in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur with a NLA of approximately 482,000 square feet.\n\nDigitalisation of the segment's operations continued with the introduction of its Property Management Application with an e-Service Requests portal that has garnered over 8,000 office users, introduction of the Ticketless Parking System combining the  License  Plate  Recognition  and  Parking  application,  as well as the establishment of a virtual tour for leasing activities. The division is committed to continue to bring in the latest technological advances to enhance overall tenants' experience.\n\nIn line with the Group's strategy to unlock value of its assets through  injection  into  Sunway  REIT,  during  the  year,  The Pinnacle Sunway was disposed of to Sunway REIT for RM450 million. The disposal was completed in November 2020.",

Although the financial and employment outlook remain steady for FY 2021, consumption may continue to be cautious as the public remain prudent in their expenditure, especially for large ticket items.\n\nHence, the path to recovery for the retail segment is expected to be gradual in the first half of FY 2021. The financial performance for the retail segment will be hampered by subdued footfall during the MCO period in the first quarter of 2021. Nevertheless, the positive development and rollout of nationwide vaccinations beginning in February 2021 may improve consumer sentiments to be in public spaces and bodes well for retail malls' footfall. As vaccinations progress in the coming months, coupled with gradual relaxation of the restriction measures, the segment is expected to return to a sense of normalcy towards the second half of the year.\n\nThe supply of retail space is expected to increase by an additional 1.93 million square feet by 1H 2021 1 , with seven retail malls and supporting components coming on-stream, increasing competition for occupancy. Leading retail malls that have demonstrated high level of resilience in managing attrition rates will see a measure of stability in occupancy, being more attractive with new domestic and international retailers entering the market.\n\nThe  retail  industry  will  likely  see  the  continued  acceleration  of digital adaptation strategies with the convergence to omni channels retailing to continue engaging with consumers in both physical premises and virtual platform. Innovative retail concepts will be a key differentiating factor for offline retail to remain competitive, and Sunway will continue to offer unique value proposition of creating experiential and destination based tenancy mix to drive footfall in its physical malls.\n\nRefreshment of tenancy mix is pivotal to appeal to the evolving consumers'  lifestyle  trends.  Sunway's  malls  have  seen  good traction from the F&B segment, beauty brands and certain fashion categories.  Challenges  remain  for  cinema  operators  and  travelrelated goods retailers, who are contending with lack of content and capacity restrictions, and border closure respectively. Retailers that are proceeding with new store openings this year are doing so because they will be in a better position to capture the market when the economy recovers and the retail landscape resets.\n\nEncouraged  by  the  experience  of  Sunway  Pyramid's  online marketplace which was piloted in 2020, the division is slated to launch 'e-Sunway Malls' in the second quarter of 2021, catering to the continuous growth of online shopping and food delivery to drive Sunway tenants' sales on digital platform. The group will continue its ongoing brand building efforts to attract more emerging brands to excite the retail and F&B offering at Sunway's malls.\n\nAt the same time, efforts to build customer confidence in the safety, health and hygiene practices at the malls will also continue to be a priority to strengthen consumers' confidence level to be in the malls.\n\nIn Seberang Jaya Penang, Sunway Carnival Mall is scheduled to open its 350,000 square feet new wing extension in the latter part of 2021.\n\n## COMMERCIAL SEGMENT\n\nMoving forward, the future office space dynamics continues to shift to adapt to the growing acceptance of work-from-home arrangements coupled with potential further consolidation of business, particularly the SMEs industries. Despite expectation of shrinkage in demand for office space, physical distancing practices may also lead to larger space requirements.\n\nIn response to this shift, the division plans to allocate collaborative space in the workplaces to accommodate companies that exploring flexible office space. Vacant units in the buildings under management could potentially be converted for other usage, such as Co-Living and Co-Working spaces.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## LEISURE\n\nMalayana Rainfortress at Sunway Lost World of Tambun\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nLeisure activities for the year has been severely dampened by the restrictions imposed in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in FY 2020 and the general fear faced by the public of transmission at public places.\n\nThe knock-on effect of the weaker economy and cut-backs by businesses  in  troubled  sectors  further  dampened  the  public's appetite for leisure expenditure, leading to declining numbers of visitorship to theme parks in Malaysia. The decline in visitorship was further exacerbated by international travel restrictions since MCO.\n\nContinued national border closures as well as interstate and interdistrict travel bans at various points throughout the year effectively limited the available customer pool for leisure destinations even when the division was allowed to operate, leaving park operators in a vulnerable position with substantially lesser visitors and drastically reduced income.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nGiven the restrictions imposed, the theme parks under the Group, namely Sunway Lagoon in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, and Sunway Lost World of Tambun in Sunway City Ipoh, effectively operated for only six months out of the whole year.\n\nLeveraging on the financial support of Sunway Group, the Leisure division focused its operations on preparing itself for the eventual recovery of the segment post-pandemic, as well as putting enhanced safety measures in place to welcome visitors in the interim that are a step-up from expectations and well above MOH recommendations. To  provide  the  safest  environment  for  visitors,  Sunway's  theme parks have introduced an improved automatic chlorination system, disinfection of high-touchpoint surfaces every two hours, and made a deliberate decision to operate at a 30% maximum capacity instead\n\nof  the  government's  50%  requirement  to  ensure  that  physical distancing can be practiced in a safer manner at both the Sunway Lagoon and Sunway Lost World of Tambun theme parks. The division introduced a unified SOP Campaign themed 'State of Play' for both Sunway Lagoon and Sunway Lost World of Tambun to highlight the heightened SOP practices at the theme parks and instil customers' confidence to visit the parks when it reopens.\n\nWhile the theme parks were restricted from operating for much of the year, the downtime during the MCO provided the opportunity to  upgrade  employees'  capability  through  training  to  improve productivity and work performance. During these periods, the theme\n\n'Aqua Blaster' Sanitising Chamber\n\n<!-- image -->",

All the rides in the facilities were repainted and props from previous campaigns and festivities have been refurbished and improved, giving both parks a refreshing face lift in anticipation of the reopening. Despite the downtime, the team continued to test its rides on a daily, weekly and monthly basis as part of its maintenance, keeping them operating in optimal conditions.\n\nA plan to introduce a night-time theme park was also set in motion, leveraging an 80-acre land area it owns to create an evening outdoor attraction to entice more visitors once Sunway Lagoon reopens. The division's team set about reimagining the idea of play in the vast outdoor space, as well as new rides and experiences for the existing parks.  Various  talents  were  redeployed  into  constructing  new attractions and beautifying both the Sunway Lagoon and Sunway Lost World of Tambun theme parks. The latter will see an improved glamping experience amid the growing popularity of its staycation packages.\n\nBoth theme parks' teams have also strived to be more innovative in finding new ways to serve customers in the new normal and have adapted its promotional strategies and packages to mirror market sentiments. Towards this end, an automatic extension of all tickets and annual pass expiry dates were granted in view of the unexpected pandemic, priming visitors for a return when the outbreak ends. The  marketing  teams  have  also  taken  advantage  of  the  closed borders to capture the pent-up demand in the domestic market, promoting vacations and staycations in the country, on its own, and in collaboration with Sunway Pyramid Hotel, Sunway Clio Hotel and Sunway Pyramid Mall in the 'Ke Sana Ke Sini Ke Sunway' campaign. Tactical promotional tie-ups with third parties also continued during FY 2020 to enhance the attractiveness of its campaigns.\n\nThese efforts support the division's aim to ride the eventual recovery of the leisure segment towards becoming the leading theme park player in the region. In the meantime, the Leisure division has placed a strong emphasis on cost reductions in response to the extreme challenges faced, restructuring the unit to be leaner and more efficient. Staff strength was downsized as necessary, with remaining employees trained to multi-task to achieve higher productivity and efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 58 for more information on the Leisure division's strategic profile.\n\nUpcycled Floating Island\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring  Chinese  New  Year  in  January  2020,  Sunway Lagoon carried out a 'A Mouse's Tale' Chinese New Year Campaign sponsored by Huawei, featuring the theme park's Captain Quack & Friends in ushering the new year with the introduction of the new and enhanced Zambezi River ride. This was followed by its Valentine's Day Promotion offering free add-on value of experiences such as free bungy jump, scuba  diver,  go-kart  and  photography  for  couples  who purchase the promotional package, provided by Digiphoto, Bungy Malaysia, G-ForceX and Titan Scuba.\n\nSunway  Lagoon  reopened  in  July  with  the  new  SOPs enforced. In August, Sunway Lagoon's Passport Roadshow held at Sunway Pyramid achieved RM1.08 million worth of sign-ups over 4 days, reflecting the public's eagerness to continue enjoying its theme park attractions.\n\nSunway Lagoon has also inked a collaboration with Sunway University in August for their research project on sun bears in Malaysia. Sunway Lagoon's sun bear population in its wildlife park will be studied by the researchers from Sunway University while both teams collaborate to create conservation educational programmes for sun bears as part of their shared commitment towards the realisation of UNSDG.\n\nSunway Lagoon's reimagined attractions during the unexpected off-season was launched in September, with a new premium event area named Monkey Island, overseeing its surf beach, which offers personalised services catered for high end groups looking for a private space for their enjoyment.\n\nAs a testament to the division's commitment towards cost reduction and support for the SDG Goal 15 to 'protect, restore and  promote  sustainable  use  of  terrestrial  ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss', the theme park launched its Floating Island - a new man-made floating island crafted from some 1.5 tonnes of upcycled waste material, now housing Pinky the gibbon. This ecofriendly floating island will serve to educate visitors on the importance of reducing, reusing and recycling waste.\n\nTowards the year's end, a crossover Halloween Christmas festive  celebration  campaign  was  conceptualised,  titled Season's Screaming featuring Day.Light.Fright, where visitors can Swim, Scream and Slide at the various haunted houses, haunted theatre, Halloween-themed Instagram worthy spots and over 90 attractions across 6 parks.\n\nDespite its short months of operations during the pandemic, Sunway Lagoon continue to be a preferred leisure destination, being  named  in  the  latest  2019  Themed  Entertainment Association's  report  as  one  of  the  Top  20  Water  Parks Worldwide in terms of attendance growth from 2018 to 2019. Sunway Lagoon at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur also won the 2020 Traveller's Choice Award, cementing its place as one of the top themed attractions in the region and the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n## SUNWAY LOST WORLD OF TAMBUN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway Lost World of Tambun ringed in 2020 with its Barbie & Hot Wheels Lucky New Year campaign in January, with lion dance performances and its capybara, the world's largest rodent, serving as attractions to welcome the Lunar Year of the Rat. A massive Hotwheels-themed dirt track and Barbie-themed doll house was set up in the theme park, and a real-life Barbie performing at a daily Barbie Rock Star mini concert.\n\nDuring the CMCO period in May, Sunway Lost World of Tambun rolled out the 'Play with Confidence' and 'Stay with Confidence' video campaign, projecting the new SOPs introduced at its theme park in collaboration with Sunway Lost World Hotel to instil visitors' confidence in its pandemic precaution measures.\n\nIn June last year, the team rolled out its Zootastic Escape where visitors can enjoy a day of edutainment with the theme park's animals. The theme park launched its Malayana Rainfortress in July, a brand-new double level water park water slides and tiered pools.\n\nTo continuously provide exceptional entertainment for its guests, Sunway Lost World of Tambun unveiled the first cinematic tube ride in Southeast Asia and a one-of-a-kind experience where myth meets the latest technology in exploring the adventure river, Dragon's Lair Adventure 4D cinematic water tunnel. With a new original story and theme song, the latest state-of-the-art concept will take guests on a journey inside the tunnel of the unpredictable world of Dragon's Lair Adventure, drifting away in a giant rubber tube along a 660-metre adventure river and beach garden surrounded by 20-foot twin waterfalls, ancient limestone hills, and greenery for a fully immersive experience.\n\nSunway Lost World of Tambun joined Sunway Lagoon theme park to introduce its unified 'State of Play' SOP Campaign to bring the public's attention and revive confidence to the stringent COVID-19 pandemic precautionary measures introduced at both theme parks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the division's rides and attractions are provided in the respective theme parks' website at https://sunwaylagoon.com/ and https://sunwaylostworldoftambun.com/ respectively.\n\nDragon's Lair Adventure 4D Cinematic Water Tunnel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic projected to ease gradually towards the second half of 2021 with the ongoing vaccines rollout since February  2021,  the  Leisure  division  is  expected  to  remain subdued during the first half of 2021 amid the ongoing travel restrictions. The theme park sector will likely be among one of the last economic sectors to recover from this crisis as its visitor base is largely pegged against the larger tourism economy. With the pandemic still ongoing and borders remained closed, domestic tourism is providing the much needed boost to help sustain local  destinations  and  tourism  businesses  including  Sunway Lagoon and Sunway Lost World of Tambun theme parks. This will continue to be a key driver of recovery for the division in the short to medium term as evidenced by the uptick in domestic tourism activities in the middle of 2020 due to displacement from international travel restrictions.\n\nTo counter the near-term effects, the division will continue to focus on cash conservation and optimising operational efficiency. The team is also expanding the brand by introducing a brand lifestyle retail product such as Sunway Lagoon's First Draw Soy Sauce and Sunway Lost World of Tambun's Ipoh White Coffee. These products will be marketed via online web store, in-park and supermarkets, leveraging commodity sale to supplement the division's income, with the line of products set to expand in 2021.\n\nThe division has since shifted its focus towards the domestic market  to  increase  the  number  of  visitors,  expanding  of  its marketing  tools  to  target  domestic  segmentation  based  on sound understanding of market sentiment and the deployment of  roadshows  events  nationwide  to  this  target  market  while borders remain closed. Meanwhile, the division will continue its brand building efforts regionally and internationally to keep the Sunway brand at the top of mind, encouraging plans for a mustvisit destination once the pandemic ends. During this period, the division will also continue revamping and innovating its rides and attractions to bring the 'Best Day Ever' experience and 'Awesome Moments' to Sunway Group's theme parks.\n\n87",

The first case of COVID-19 in the country was detected on 25 January 2020 and continued its gradual onslaught on Malaysia, leading to the implementation of the first MCO on 18 March 2020 and various phases of restrictions from then on.\n\nOperating  amid  a  raging  pandemic  in  FY  2020,  the  hospitality industry was severely affected by COVID-19's impact on the tourism and  aviation  industries,  with  hotels  temporarily  shuttered  amid suspension  of  international  travels  and  the  cancellation  of  Visit Malaysia 2020 campaign. To stay afloat, industry players have put in place extensive cost management measures with an adaptive strategy for a lean and agile operations while maximising the use of governmental incentives and stimulus to cushion the blow.\n\nDuring the resumption of interstate travels in June 2020, local hospitality businesses saw a surge in local holidaymakers after a period of lockdowns coupled with attractive tactical promotional packages being launched in the market. The luxury resort segment has enjoyed strong demand and benefitted from the international travel restriction as domestic travellers are homebound. To boost domestic tourism activities, the government announced a personal income  tax  relief  of  RM1,000  on  domestic  tourism  and  hotel accommodation expenditure that was later made claimable until 31 December 2021. A service tax exemption on accommodation and related services was also announced under the National Economic Recovery Plan by the Government of Malaysia, allowing hotel rates to be quoted nett in Ringgit Malaysia inclusive of 0% service tax. A separate exemption of tourism tax for foreigners was also introduced to entice international visitors, in force until 30 June 2021. Efforts to establish green lanes to facilitate cross-border travel were derailed by the disparate timing of outbreaks and mismatch of SOPs with partner countries.\n\nThe  Meetings,  Incentives,  Conferences  and  Exhibition  ('MICE') segment was also crippled as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Suspension of international travel globally wiped out demand for convention  and  exhibition  spaces  while  prolonged  intermittent restrictions on large gatherings also affected bookings for meetings and banquets.\n\nThough the appeal of traditional physical events remains, virtual events  offer  exhibitors  and  speakers  a  more  cost-effective  and time-saving means to reach a wider audience without the need for participants to travel. This may likely result in a broader range of events offering a remote attendance option in the future, particularly as  the  global  population  becomes  more  familiar  with  online communications software, live-streaming technologies and the costsaving aspects of remote meetings.\n\nArtist's impression of Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nIn light of the immediate challenges impacting occupancy rates, Sunway's Hospitality division continues to diversify its product offering and source for alternative business opportunities in order to continue to generate revenue for the division. Innovative stay packages were also conceptualised to create new demand amid the pandemic. Leveraging on the synergy of Sunway's integrated townships and developments, the division launched several promotional packages which is unique to Sunway such as 'Ke Sana Ke Sini Ke Sunway' and 'STAY-Kawtim, MAKAN Unlimited!' packages. The 'Ke Sana Ke Sini Ke Sunway' campaign was a collaborative effort with Sunway Lagoon and Sunway Pyramid Mall, offering an exhilarating stay, play and retail experience in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. The campaign received overwhelming take-up of over 18,000 room nights sold between 6 to 20 July 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrict hygiene and safety protocols were implemented in all aspects of the hotels' operations to ensure the safety of employees and hotel guests. Over 30 safety and hygiene protocols were put in place under the Sunway Safe Stay programme, with heightened cleaning and sanitisation practices for greater assurance, comfort and wellbeing standards, providing each guest with a peace of mind when they stay with Sunway hotels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails on the Sunway Safe Stay protocol at https://www.sunwayhotels.com/sunway-safe-stay\n\nForeseeing the pandemic's impact on the occupancy, revenue and profit, the division operated in austerity mode with cost containment initiatives implemented across the hotels by tightening expenditure and reviewing existing business processes to be more agile and lean. To rein in operational cost, staff at all hotels were put on rotational schedule as the manning requirements of the hotels decreased. Employees  were  also  upskilled  to  facilitate  multitasking,  with deployment and secondment to other Sunway Business Units to strengthen employees' capabilities in operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway Safe Stay programme with over 30 safety and hygiene protocols\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the unexpected forced closure during MCO and low occupancy environment for the rest of the year, the division took the opportunity to undertake  asset  enhancement  initiatives  and  preventive maintenance to refresh its hotel assets to ride on the post-pandemic rebound. Sunway Resort (formerly known as Sunway Resort Hotel & Spa) is earmarked for a tantalising transformation, with approximately RM248.3 million (USD60 million) invested for the flagship hotel in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. Aside from aesthetic remodelling, the refurbishment will unveil cutting-edge technology and sustainable features to further establish the hotel as a premier tourist destination and Asia's leading integrated resort complex and tourism hub. The hotel is scheduled to re-open in phases from the third quarter of 2021, in time to celebrate its 25 th year of operations.\n\nSunway Putra Hotel upgraded its rooms with additional amenities such as smoke detectors, USB and international power sockets and new pantry flooring to enhance guests' experience in the hotel. Further upgrades are planned in 2021 to prepare the hotel for the post-pandemic demands.  Upgrading and restoration works were also carried out at the other Sunway hotels during these lull periods.\n\nThe  Hospitality  division  also  launched  its  new  hotel  website, www.sunwayhotels.com on 14 May 2020 with a refreshed user journey and functionalities. The new website will allow guests to book their rooms directly with the hotels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 59 for more information on the Hospitality division's strategic profile.\n\n89",

In the second half of the year, Sunway Resort was fully closed for refurbishment while adjacent Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Clio Hotel continued operating when permitted.\n\nAside from competitively priced room rates, special pandemic bundles such as work from hotel package, special rates for frontliners  and  MICE  packages  with  social  distancing  setups, were also offered by the hotels. The 'Pusing Selangor Dulu!' campaign was also rolled out, taking advantage of the heightened health awareness amid the pandemic to offer health screenings at Sunway Medical Centre bundled with hotel rooms for healthful staycations.\n\nThe hotels also participated in various virtual and physical travel shows, wedding exhibitions and consumer shows organised by Tourism Malaysia and other business partners targeting the local, Middle East and East Europe markets which helps to provide a ready audience for subsequent promotional efforts.\n\nAlthough  occupancy  rates  for  the  year  is  markedly  lower compared to previous years, all three hotels ranked highly as 'Loved by Guests' in 2020 by Hotels.com. TripAdvisor also named Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Clio Hotel for their Travellers' Choice Hotel Awards 2020. The trio of hotels also received  the  Muslim  Friendly  Accommodation  Recognition ('MFAR') Certification during the year.\n\nTo diversify the division's revenue, the hotels expanded on its F&B offerings, implementing new menus to reach out to the market with take-aways and delivery options for The Resort Caf\u00e9 in addition to the stricter safety and hygiene-prioritised in-house dining experience. Promotions were ramped up especially for festive periods such as Ramadan and the year end celebration, proving popular with commendable demand.\n\n## SUNWAY PUTRA HOTEL, KUALA LUMPUR\n\nSunway Putra Hotel has traditionally been a popular choice for the MICE segment. However, the corporate meetings segment was essentially negligible in 2020, with most companies opting for virtual summits. During the CMCO and RMCO periods when meetings  were  permitted,  Sunway  Putra  Hotel  saw  higher traction of events, meetings and residential meetings from the government sectors than the private sectors, but overall demand remained low.\n\nWith the unfavourable prevailing conditions, Sunway Putra Hotel managed to stimulate the sluggish market with various domestic room promotional packages such as the highly successful STAYKawtim, MAKAN Unlimited! Package. Its first ever all-inclusive staycation package at an incredible 50% discount off its actual value features a 2D1N stay in a Superior Room for a family of\n\n4, inclusive of breakfast, a 9-hour eat-all-you-can dining spree, and RM100 in cash vouchers and additional discounts from participating tenants at the adjacent Sunway Putra Mall. More than 2,000 packages were sold during the promotional period from August to September 2020.\n\nThe proactive response by Sunway Putra Hotel translated into overwhelming guests' satisfaction from their experiences at the hotel, scoring 91.4% on its Guest Review Index. Positive reviews were further affirmed by the various web booking portals such as Hotels.com, TripAdvisor, Traveloka and Agoda. More awards and accolades for the hospitality division is disclosed in page 34.\n\nSunway  Putra  Hotel  was  also  a  recipient  of  the  MFAR Certification, and was selected as the 'Hotel Mesra Keluarga Pilihan' (Family-Friendly Hotel Choice) of 2020 by Majalah Pa & Ma.\n\n## SUNWAY  HOTEL  GEORGETOWN  AND  SUNWAY  HOTEL SEBERANG JAYA, PENANG.\n\nIn  the  year  under  review,  Sunway  Hotel  Georgetown  and Sunway Hotel Seberang Jaya recorded Guest Review Index of 86.1% and 87.6% respectively. This was achieved on the back of strong efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, with an emphasis on product diversification and differentiation based on market demand for stringent health and safety protocols, as well as their austerity measures.\n\nBoth  hotels  obtained  'Clean  &  Safe  Malaysia'  certification from Bureau Veritas in a campaign supported by the Malaysian Association of Hotels, as well as the recognition from Penang state Exco for Tourism Development, Arts, Culture and Heritage office ('PETACH') under 'Penang Lawan COVID-19' campaign. These, combined with the #SunwaySafeStay campaign, helped to create a unique selling point during the pandemic period, positioning  these  hotels  as  the  ideal  choice  for  customers' peace of mind.\n\nAs part of the hotel's pandemic mitigation action plan, Sunway Hotel Seberang Jaya shifted to a room-only model to provide a no-frills accommodation for its guests at affordable prices. Meanwhile, Sunway Hotel Georgetown partnered with a nearby theme park to diversify its product offering by creating a 'Stay, Swim and Splash' package for its guests and create shared demand.\n\n## OTHERS HOTELS\n\nThe Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat achieved a rating of 94.6% in Guest Review Index for 2020 and brought home the TripAdvisor Travellers'  Choice  Hotel  Awards  2020.  Other  hotels  in  the group such as Sunway Velocity Hotel, Sunway Hanoi Hotel and Sunway Phnom Penh continued operating amid the challenging operating environment.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n## GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY\n\nDespite the challenges, Sunway's Hospitality division rallied to offer support to the community during the pandemic, donating over 4,000 repurposed bars of soap in its Soapful project to underprivileged families, aid organisations, juvenile centres, prisons and many others. This campaign serves to ensure that everyone, regardless of their social status, can practice personal hygiene to protect themselves from the pandemic while preventing the soap from ending up in landfills unnecessarily.\n\nThe division also channelled the spirit of Ramadan to cook and  distribute  4,500  packets  of  bubur  lambuk  in  Klang Valley and 2,000 packets in Penang to frontline workers, essential services staff, police officers and members of the B40 community back in May 2020. In October 2020, Sunway Putra Hotel also donated 5,000 eggs to the Kechara Soup Kitchen to support their food aid out-reach in line with the Group's commitment towards UNSDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger.\n\nSunway Putra Hotel's eggs donation to underserved communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nForecasts for Malaysia's tourism market remains lacklustre as travel bans and border restrictions remain in force amid vaccine rollout in the first quarter of 2021, with the return of travellers' confidence expected to be slow. Hence, the Hospitality division will still be focusing on domestic travellers in the near term while remaining agile to adapt its strategies as and when the market changes.\n\nSunway Resort will unveil an immaculate refurbished hotel to drum up interest as it sets a new benchmark for business and leisure experience in the region. The revamped hotel will be introducing exhilarating product differentiation for different target segments, new and refreshed components of meeting, dinner and wedding packages, new destination-based packages with components from the cluster of hotels in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, as well as the Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill, the world-renowned multi-Michelin starred chef's first restaurant in Malaysia. With its range of digital and technology upgrades, the hotel aims to capture millennials and other tech-savvy guests, while realigning its business model to be more mindful of the resources it consumes with increased sustainability awareness.\n\nGoing into 2021, the division's hotels will continue to adjust their business offering and SOPs for the new normal, continuing on the path of austerity in containing cost while maintaining lean operations. Strategic investment in maintenance and enhancement initiatives, including adoption of new technological solutions, will continue to be implemented as planned to prepare the division for the travel segment's  eventual  rebound.  More  educational  programmes and training will be provided to staff to help them adapt to the requirements of the new normal and the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0.\n\nOther  strategic  priorities  for  the  division  include  driving  room bookings  directly  under  the  Group's  website,  strengthening  the hotels' processes and teams, and continued investment in new implements to enrich consumer travel experience, such as the installation of self check-in kiosks in Sunway Hotel Seberang Jaya and Sunway Hotel Georgetown by first half of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  Group  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  the Government and travel and hospitality associations to establish safe travel bubbles and heightened SOPs to drive demand amid an air of continued COVID-19 caution. The Hospitality division will continue to explore and build upon synergistic strength of Sunway Group to offer packages in collaboration with Sunway's various divisions, and leverage the size and scale of the Group to negotiate for the best savings with efficient sourcing and procurement practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Construction activities across the country was brought to a standstill due to the virus containment measures. Although construction sites in the country were allowed to resume operations in May 2020, many construction sites faced challenges to restart.\n\nFor Sunway Construction Group Berhad ('SunCon'), operations were impacted by project site shutdowns and reduced productivity on the sites when operational due to the strict pandemic SOPs in place. Among the main challenges faced during this period were disruptions in supply chain, lack of labour availability, and adhering to stringent safety protocols for its workers to prevent infection.\n\nAmid the pandemic, the delay in roll out and shelving of mega infrastructure projects due to government's financial constraints have  also  impacted  the  construction  industry  performance  in 2020. Scarcity of projects in this softer market has created an overcompetitive environment for the local construction sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 60 to 61 for more information on SunCon's strategic profile.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nTo  mitigate  the  immediate  fallout  from  COVID-19  containment measures, SunCon responded effectively by establishing a Business Continuity Plan to steer the division through the crisis and to protect the long-term value of its business. Prioritising safety and the wellbeing of the division's employees, the team implemented a Post-MCO Safe Working procedures in line with the authorities' safety protocols. SunCon required all its construction workers to undergo COVID-19 screening and must be tested negative prior to their return to work, while continuing to monitor developments and mitigate risks related to the pandemic and the impact on its projects, operations, supply chain, and most importantly the health and safety of its employees.\n\nOn  the  back  end,  digitalisation  initiatives  were  accelerated  for implementation to facilitate the division's business transformation and various cost management initiatives were established to optimise business  performance.  The  focus  remains  on  ensuring  smooth project execution and delivery, while expanding its core businesses in line with its growth strategy. Regional expansion through securing more overseas projects and potential joint venture partnerships with countries in South East Asia and India were on the agenda, while also exploring opportunities in the sustainable energy sector such as solar panels.\n\nDespite the challenging environment, SunCon was successful in tendering for more in-house projects from the Sunway Group's development  projects.  The  steady  flow  of  jobs  have  helped  to cushion the impact and translated to a more resilient performance for FY 2020. As at 31 December 2020, SunCon exceeded its order book replenishment target with RM2.3 billion in new orders with RM51 million from new precast contracts.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nHIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nORDERBOOK HIGHLIGHTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunCon continued to make good progress on project execution and remains on track to deliver its projects on time and within budget. The team have completed the MRT V201 project, also known as the Putrajaya Line, which is set to be operational by 2H 2021. The Nippon Express Warehouse project in Shah Alam constructed on a joint venture with Taisei Corporation of Japan has also been completed in the year under review.\n\nOther key projects in its portfolio, including the construction of TNB HQ Campus Phase 2 project in Bangsar, the Petronas New Leadership Centre project in Bangi, and the LRT GS07&08 project in the Klang Valley are progressing steadily. The contract sum for the LRT GS07&08 project however, has been revised to RM1.295 billion with remodelled scope of works following the project's cost rationalisation exercise.\n\nSunCon was also successful in its efforts to secure more construction projects  regionally  with  the  award  of  two  highway  construction projects in India for approximately RM508.0 million and RM315.0 million  respectively,  under  the  Hybrid  Annuity  Model  ('HAM') approach. The first project is the construction of four-laning Thorapalli Agraharam to Jittandahalli section of National Highway (NH-844) from  Km.  23.350  to  Km.  60.100  under  Bharatmala  Pariyojana Phase-I (National Corridor) in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The second project involves construction of a two-lane road with paved shoulder of the Meensurutti (Km. 98.433) to Chidambaram (Km. 129.965) section of NH-227 of the Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I in Tamil Nadu, India. These projects were awarded to its joint venture consortium with RNS Infrastructure Ltd, established since SunCon's maiden venture into India in 2001, marking SunCon's 8 th and 9 th highway projects in India to date.\n\nProjects  secured  from  Sunway  Group  during  the  year  totalled RM1.37 billion in value, which include the Sunway International School, Sunway Belfield service apartments, CP2 mixed commercial development project at Sunway South Quay, Sunway Velocity TWO Plot B serviced apartments and retail, and Sunway Medical Centre Phase 4, with work commencing at all 5 projects.\n\nPetronas New Leadership Centre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION PREFABRICATION HUB\n\nConstruction of SunCon's fully-automated Integrated Construction Prefabrication  Hub  ('ICPH')  facility  in  Singapore  was  delayed due to the 3-month circuit breaker halt in Singapore that led to a standstill in most construction activities as a result of manpower disruption and movement restrictions in foreign worker dormitories. Construction has been resumed and is expected to be completed in 2022, while the plant is set to be fully operational in the same year to begin meeting the rising demand for precast components in Singapore with its 75,000m 3 of production capacity.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE ENERGY VENTURES\n\nOn  9  June  2020,  SunCon  entered  into  a  memorandum  of understanding ('MoU') with ENGIE South East Asia Pte Ltd, a member of European energy solutions leader ENGIE Group, to set up a joint venture company in exploration of district cooling systems for greenfield and brownfield urban development projects. With this collaboration, SunCon will be able to leverage on the expertise and experience from ENGIE South East Asia as well as explore opportunities to expand the district cooling technology in Malaysia to build a sustainable future together.\n\nFurthermore, the division made significant inroads on its sustainable energy play with the award of 3 external solar photovoltaic ('PV') system projects from F&N Group of companies for its factories in Shah Alam and Klang in Selangor, and Karak, Pahang, with a  combined  contract  value  of  RM18.1  million.  On  top  of  that, Universiti Sains Malaysia ('USM') had also awarded SunCon the rooftop Power Purchase Agreement ('PPA') solar project at USM's Engineering Campus in Nibong Tebal, Penang. These projects will be carried out in 2021 and are expected to be completed in the same year.\n\n## UPHOLDING QUALITY STANDARDS\n\nSunCon continued to leverage its hallmark use of Virtual Design and  Construction  ('VDC')  systems  and  Building  Information Modelling ('BIM') to enhance the quality of its design and build. The construction of TNB HQ Campus project and Petronas New Leadership Centre ('PNLC') project were implemented with VDC and BIM to Level of Detail 500, which represents accurate and field verified elements after construction. The PNLC project was the first project in Malaysia and South East Asia to be certified by British Standards Institution ('BSI') to ISO 19650. Implementation of VDC and BIM are ongoing at Sunway's in-house building projects as well.\n\nAll of SunCon's project sites are also certified to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System, with a commitment to continue adopting  a  systematic  approach  to  minimise  its  environmental footprint.\n\nPNLC PROJECT BECAME THE 1 ST PROJECT IN SOUTH EAST ASIA TO BE CERTIFIED BY BSI TO ISO 19650\n\n93",

        "page_content": "94\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nThe construction sector in Malaysia is expected to rebound in the latter  half  of  2021  with  the  gradual  normalisation  in  economic activities  and  labour  market  conditions  upon  vaccines  rollout. However, the landscape remains challenging on the back of the soft economic landscape that is still reeling from pandemic shocks and the ongoing political uncertainty.\n\nAs part of the Malaysian Government's economic recovery plans, RM15 billion in funds has been allocated for mega-infrastructure projects such as the MRT3, Penang Transport Master Plan and JB-Singapore Rapid Transit System to spur the rebound of the construction sector. As a leading player in the industry, SunCon will be looking to capture the opportunities arising from these development plans while pursuing other local commercial development projects through  competitive  bidding.  Apart  from  that,  SunCon  will  also be supporting Sunway Group's expansion plans with its planned construction  of  healthcare  facilities,  providing  a  steady  stream of opportunities for SunCon to grow its orderbook and cement its position in the construction landscape.\n\nSunCon's robust, diversified order book value of RM5.1 billion is going to tide the division over for two to three years while the economy rebounds and the industry looks forward to more infrastructure pump priming efforts from the Government.\n\nIn the meantime, SunCon will keep pushing its regional expansion overseas, to India, Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore in particular, as a measure to mitigate any slowdown of the local construction sector. Leveraging on the success the division has made in the recent India highway projects, SunCon is poised to capitalise on opportunities arising from India's national growth plans.\n\nThe sustainable energy sector remains strong on SunCon's agenda, offering bright prospects with SunCon's successful solar PV track record and Malaysia's anticipated increase in sustainable energy generation to 20% of its mix by 2025. Likewise, district cooling systems present an attractive avenue to grow SunCon's business and will continue to feature in the division's plans, as will its efforts to automate and digitalise processes through VDC to improve all aspects of project life cycles.\n\nWith clear strategic priorities and efficient management, SunCon is cautiously optimistic of its ability to continue posting positive performance in the year ahead while steering through the challenging and uncertain construction landscape of 2021.\n\nSunway Big Box Hotel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway Medical Centre solar PV project\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\n\nAs a leading construction group, SunCon is always looking to enhance its capabilities with progressive technologies and adoption of digitalisation and automation as key enablers of its business transformation. Following the successful delivery of the first and the largest BIM-Facility Management ('FM') project in Malaysia at the Parcel F, Putrajaya project in 2019, SunCon continued to accelerate its advancement in this area with the introduction of BIM-FM solutions in Sunway City as part of the Group's commitment to UNSDG, with over RM40 million invested in the integration of BIM in its daily operations.\n\nAnother key step in its digital transformation was realised in FY  2020  with  the  deployment  of  its  open-source  Chatbot technology  to  streamline  construction  site  processes  and support  project  operations  and  implementation  of  safety measures - achieving another first in the local construction industry.\n\nSunCon is set to continue leveraging on Industrial Revolution 4.0 technologies to provide further value-added services to its clients and achieve business excellence.\n\n## 1 ST CONTRACTOR IN MALAYSIA\n\nTO DEPLOY CHATBOT TECHNOLOGY TO STREAMLINE CONSTRUCTION SITE PROCESSES\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nSunway Medical Centre, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe emergence of COVID-19 infections in Malaysia has forced a disruptive shift across most industries and sectors, including the healthcare sector. To curb the spread of the virus, the Government implemented various stages of MCO across the whole nation since March  2020.  Fortunately,  during  the  MCO  period,  healthcare operations were able to continue as it falls within the purview of essential services.\n\nAs a result of the MCOs which closed the international borders and imposition of interstate travel restrictions, the medical tourism segment was further affected with the deferment of the 'Malaysia Year  of  Healthcare  Travel  2020'  campaign  by  the  Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council.\n\nThe calamitous turn of events affected the financial performance of private healthcare sector as patients and doctors deferred their elective medical procedures. This has resulted in a sharp drop in the number of admissions and outpatient treatments, stemming from the international  border closures which caused a decline in medical tourists' visits and interstate travel restrictions making it difficult for patients to travel from out of state. Further, due to the general fear of contracting the virus, private healthcare as a whole saw a decline in patients opting to postpone appointments or delay their treatments.\n\nThe  implementation  of  stringent  infection  control  protocols  and the scarcity of pandemic related protection kits have led to higher operating costs for healthcare institutions. Manpower deployment and allocation of more resources to the frontlines has also caused a strain to the whole healthcare sector.\n\nWith restrictions on patients' mobility, the medical industry is seeing the trend transitioning from conventional face-to-face consultations to a more digitally-driven service model.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\n## MOBILISING COVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nTo manage the outbreak and ensure the highest standards of safety and quality of care for all its patients, visitors, doctors, and healthcare employees,  the  hospitals  have  taken  stringent  precautionary measures to ensure that the hospital environment is safe.\n\nAt Sunway Medical Centre Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, the number of entrances to the hospital was limited and a special triage was set up to screen all visitors entering the hospital, as well as providing a dedicated waiting area for all suspected cases. It also established COVID-19  testing  booths,  negative  pressure  mobile  cabins  and isopods as part of its COVID-19 response. The healthcare division had invested in UV Hyperlight Robotic System for effective sanitisation of the hospital environment.\n\nThe Healthcare division activated its Business Continuity Plan as a precautionary measure during the health crisis to manage its costs and resources. Administrative staff were reassigned and deployed to frontline roles such as the triage at entrances. Procurement of personal  protective  equipment  ('PPE')  was  undertaken  at  the Group level to gain economies of scale and efficient cost saving advantages.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, when PPEs such as masks, gloves and sanitisers were in shortage, the division resorted to making its own PPE and hand sanitisers to ensure effective infection prevention to keep patients, staff and doctors safe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see pages 62 to 63 for more information on the Healthcare division's strategic profile.\n\n95",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## SUPPORTING PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM\n\nSunway's  Healthcare  division  stepped  up  to  help  alleviate  the pandemic  burden  on  the  public  healthcare  infrastructure  by developing  a  Public-Private  Partnership  ('PPP')  with  Ministry of Health and Selangor State Health Department to accept nonCOVID-19  cases  from  public  hospitals  dedicated  to  the  fight the virus, while freeing up public hospitals' capacity that can be allocated for COVID-19 treatment. Under the arrangement, Sunway secured a contract from Hospital Kuala Lumpur to receive referrals for patients needing MRI scans.\n\nA Government Referral Programme was also established to tap into the increasing interest of consultants from public hospitals to refer their patients to Sunway's healthcare centres for elective surgeries, which  also  saw  Sunway  receiving  referrals  from  other  private hospitals.\n\n## STIMULATING REVENUE GROWTH\n\nThe division capitalised on the needs of pandemic mitigation, such as  COVID-19  screening  services  and  molecular  lab  services  to generate new revenue streams. Sunway Medical Centre is certified by the Ministry of Health ('MOH') to provide a range of COVID-19 screening services including Antibody Test, RTK-Antigen Test and RT-PCR Test, with drive-through services available. The popularity of the drive-through services spurred the creation of a separate 'Paeds Stop' paediatric vaccination promotion at Sunway Medical Centre Velocity, operating on the Jab-and-Go concept to ensure the continuity of young patients' vaccination programmes.\n\nWith the drop in demand for non-critical healthcare services during the pandemic and restrictions limiting visits, a first step towards maintaining  patients'  access  to  the  Healthcare  division's  range of healthcare services was with the setting up of teleconsultation services, mobile healthcare services and delivery of prescription medicine to patients to make healthcare more accessible.\n\nEfforts  were  also  made  to  highlight  the  stringent  precautionary measures at its facilities to position Sunway's Healthcare division as innovative, safe and COVID-19-free to encourage patients to resume clinical visits and treatments. This included fast-tracking the adoption of innovative digital solutions to minimise physical contact at its facilities, such as the implementation of online pre-registration for outpatients.\n\nCOVID-19 testing booth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nAmid the pandemic, Sunway's Healthcare division continues to record achievements for its healthcare services. One of the most notable awards was being the sole winner for 2020 Asia Pacific Healthcare and Medical Tourism Award for Medical Tourism Hospital of the Year by Global Health and Travel. The Healthcare division's proficiency in specialised areas of fertility, oncology, paediatric ophthalmology and ambulatory care also racked up a host of awards.\n\n## SUNWAY MEDICAL CENTRE VELOCITY\n\nSunway  Medical  Centre Velocity which commenced operations  in  September  2019  has  achieved  notable milestones within its first year of operations. The hospital passed stringent application process to be listed as a panel hospital with all major insurance and third party administrator, as well as successfully achieved positive EBITDA in the last quarter of FY 2020.\n\nDuring the year, the hospital has expanded the range and scope of its healthcare services with the launch of a Neuro Centre, Heart & Lung Centre and a Weight Management Centre within its hospital.\n\n## SUNWAY SPECIALIST CENTRE DAMANSARA\n\nThe healthcare division's ambulatory care centre, Sunway Specialist Centre Damansara ('SSCD') continued to build on  its  strengths  and  introduce  two  new  specialities  as part of its healthcare offerings, namely digestive and liver health. More than 10 highly skilled and experienced visiting consultants  specialising  in  the  fields  of  obstetrics  and gynaecology, paediatrics, digestive and liver health, maternal fetal medicine, and ear, nose and throat health were also recruited throughout 2020.\n\n## RESEARCH AND EDUCATION\n\nSunway  Medical  Centre  Sunway  City  continued  to  lead collaboration efforts with world class educational institutions, such as the Royal College of Physicians and University of Cambridge through Continuous Medical Education Taster Webinar series during the pandemic in place of the usual physical meetings.\n\nIn May 2020, Sunway Medical Centre and Sunway Traditional and Complementary Medicine ('TCM') joined forces with medical experts visiting from China to discuss treatments, management and preventive measures for COVID-19. The healthcare division has also partnered with Sungai Buloh hospital, Ministry of Health Malaysia and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Alumni Malaysia to work on a research initiative on treatment options for COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nThe  first  half  of  2021  remains  challenging  with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the country. The  implementation  of  stricter  MCO  restrictions since 18 January 2021 have successfully brought down COVID-19 infection numbers from a high of over 5,000 new infections daily towards the end of January 2021 to under 2,000 new infections in March 2021.\n\nThe outlook of the private healthcare sector hinges on the pace of COVID-19 vaccination rollout which started  in  February  2021  and  is  expected  to reach the needed 80% of population threshold for herd immunity within a year. The effectiveness of continued control measures to keep infections at a manageable level to eventually reopen international borders and resume regular healthcare activities in the latter half of the year will also boost the demand for more healthcare services.\n\n## RESOURCES FOR COVID-19 TREATMENT\n\nAs part of the emergency effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, both public hospitals and participating private hospitals will operate in a 'hybrid cluster' under  the  Malaysian  government's  COVID-19 Integrated Control Centre to treat both COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients.\n\nThe Healthcare division has dedicated a separate section  of  its  Sunway  Medical  Centre  hospital complex to ward COVID-19 patients. Investments have been made to restructure the hospital, setting aside  dedicated  teams  and  outfitting  facilities  to enable  the  hospital  to  safely  handle  COVID-19 cases that may come in, without compromising the safety of its non-COVID-19 patients. This includes a  dedicated  and  well-trained  team  of  medical professionals and housekeeping staff, as well as special sealed-off wards with separate entrances and lifts for separate access. These wards are also equipped with separate Air Handling Units ('AHUs') and  negative  pressure  facilities  surrounding  the rooms  and  wards  to  prevent  infectious  particles from escaping.\n\n## DIGITAL HEALTH INVESTMENT\n\nThe  division's  proactive  digitisation  of  healthcare services led it to become the first private hospital in the country to establish telemedicine services. Beginning with teleconsultation in March 2020, the effort has now progressed to become a Telemedicine Command  Centre  at  Sunway  Medical  Centre, operating 24/7 via calls, emails, and social media platforms to provide first level healthcare advisory services to patients.\n\nSince 1 January 2021, Sunway Medical Centre's Telemedicine Command Centre has begun operating 24/7, manned by certified medical officers and nurses, including medical specialists, clinical psychologists, speech therapists and audiologists, allowing  for  patient-doctor  consultations  through virtual clinics without worrying about infection risks.\n\nLeverage on the Hub & Spoke Model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXPANSION ON TRACK\n\nThe Healthcare division is actively pursuing its expansion strategy by building 6 new hospitals and medical facilities across Sunway's developments and townships in Malaysia such as Penang, Johor and the East Coast over the next 6 to 7 years. The construction of two new hospitals in Seberang Jaya, Penang, and Kota Damansara in the Klang Valley are currently in progress and expected to be completed by 1H 2022 and 2H 2023 respectively. The current operating hospitals at Sunway City and Sunway Velocity are also expanding their facilities at the hospitals to cater for more specialised medical care.\n\nIn September 2020, the Group has appointed Maybank Investment Bank Berhad to explore strategic investment options for its healthcare portfolio, in line with the Group's objective to enhance shareholders' value.\n\nIn preparation for an increasingly ageing nation, the division is also embarking on a maiden project of a purpose-built assisted-living and independent-living tower with senior-friendly features located next to its flagship hospital, Sunway Medical Centre in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe division remains optimistic of the long-term growth potential of the healthcare industry. To maintain its lead as one of the foremost private healthcare providers in the country, the division will continue to diversify and deepen its range of services for a more comprehensive healthcare offering that is at the cutting edge of the medical field.\n\nRadixact-X9 Tomotherapy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n97",

There was also slowdown in demands in some of the international markets such as during Singapore's circuit breaker pandemic control measure and Indonesia's partial lockdown implementation. As China was able to suppress the COVID-19 pandemic early, the division's China operations managed to capitalise on the fiscal stimulus implemented and thus were able to achieve even better results than pre-COVID periods.\n\nFluctuation in commodity prices, such as lower coal and oil prices, have also lowered demand for the division's heavy equipment and heavy equipment parts sales in Indonesia and East Malaysia.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nThe diversity of the Trading and Manufacturing division's customer profiles and geographic spread helped to cushion and stagger the impact to the business performance as the pandemic unfolded.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, the division activated its business continuity plans, with staff arranged to work in alternate teams and efforts underway to enhance the division's IT infrastructure to facilitate working from home. Stringent COVID-19 SOPs were put to in place at the workplace to prevent transmission within the division, while cost savings measures were implemented to rein in expenditures.\n\nDue  to  the  COVID-19  restrictions  implemented  worldwide,  the division has seen a growing acceptance of online sales for Sunway Winstar's retail business - a trend prevalent in the current digital age, with more brands and businesses setting up online platforms, bridging geographic gaps and increasing competition for traditional brick and mortar setups.\n\nCASE Skid Steer Loader\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  division's  Industrial  Hardware  company,  Sunway Winstar, took the opportunity to set up digital sales channels for its retail subsidiary, Jaya DIY. By setting up virtual shops on shopping platforms like Shopee and Lazada, Jaya DIY began online trading for some of its hardware and safety products, particularly healthcare products such as 3-ply disposable face masks and hand sanitisers, which was in high demand during the pandemic and gradually expanded its online product list.\n\nA new product line was added to the division's portfolio with the acquisition of a distributor of material handling equipment in Subang Jaya, now known as Sunway Material Handling Sdn. Bhd. ('SMH'). SMH is a sole distributor of well-known brands such as Tailift forklifts (wholly owned by Toyota Industries Corporation, Japan), Antwell attachments, Kumakai  forklift  tyres  and  the  division's  own  in-house brand, Metta for warehouse trucks. Besides providing sales and after-sales services, SMH is a solutions provider and one-stop centre for both warehousing and material handling equipment needs in the market. SMH also cater to shortand long-term customer needs by providing forklift trucks rental service.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  division  continues  to  strengthen  its operational performance throughout the pandemic, which sees its Australian subsidiary, Total Rubber Limited acquiring ISO 45001, ISO 14001, and ISO 9001 certifications in 2020. Additional agencies were also acquired during the year, an increase from a total of 181 in 2019 to 191 in 2020, further fortifying the division's reputation as a one-stop centre for the region's growing trading and manufacturing needs.\n\nAmong the optimisation initiatives implemented was the adoption of the Warehouse Management System ('WMS') at its Rawang outpost, which has increased the efficiency and quality of our warehouse operations.\n\nTailift forklift\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunflex hydraulic hoses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nWith enforced public health emergency restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic was initially showing incremental signs of improvement in Malaysia and an overall downward trend in the region amid vaccine rollout  in  February  2021.  However,  uncertainty  persists  as  the recent spike of infections has placed the country into another round of movement restriction orders. Its impact is currently difficult to predict, though the world is cautiously optimistic of a post pandemic future likely in the latter half of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the external environment of the division's operating climate  remains  challenging  with  weak  economic  sentiments, putting a dampener on FDI and weakening the Ringgit. However, the division remains optimistic on its China market growth which is set to perform favourably in 2021 with the Far East nation's expected economic boom.\n\nOther factors likely to impact performance in 2021 and beyond includes  the  continued  competition  from  manufacturers  and e-commerce platforms for a share of the trade volume, an industrywide shortage of freight containers raising logistic costs and staff retention in the challenging economic environment.\n\nIn an effort to manage these risks, the division has established limits for its working capital levels, while putting in place plans to further achieve  economies  of  scale  and  increase  operational  efficiency among its operating units.\n\nIn 2021, the Trading and Manufacturing division has earmarked capital  expenditure  to  increase  its  production  capacity  of  the factories in Wuhu, China in anticipation of a growth in demand upon the sector's eventual recovery. Further, the division will continue to source for new geographical expansion via strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, as well as procure new products and agency lines towards becoming the leading Trading and Manufacturing player in ASEAN, China and Australia.\n\nThe division will continue to strengthen its IT systems for greater efficiency and reliability to support its wide network of operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 64 for more information on the Trading and Manufacturing division's strategic profile.",

The quarry industry was also impacted during this period. All quarries and asphalt plants were shut down for a duration of 7 weeks during the MCO, with continued challenges plaguing the sector throughout the year such as restrictions on the operating capacity, labour issues, as well as transportation and supply chain challenges. Inhibition of overall economic activities and reduction of construction projects affected demand for the division's quarry products, resulting in lower sales volume for both aggregates and premix products, on top of the loss incurred from the MCO halts.\n\nExisting challenges of the industry such as licensing renewal and environmental impact remain an ongoing concern, though with less prominence in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 65 for more information on the Quarry division's strategic profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nThe Quarry division took this opportunity to implement several cost optimisation measures by reviewing its business processes and streamlining its manpower, contracts and capital expenditures to mitigate the reduction in sales during MCO while still continuing to incur fixed costs.\n\nThe slower economy also allowed the division to continue with its strategic  plan  to  explore  expansion  opportunities  via  greenfield developments or acquisition of existing sites in order to grow the market coverage in Malaysia.\n\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, the division has activated its Business Continuity Plan to minimise the consequential business impacts and this has accelerated the use of technology to improve its business efficiency and effectiveness. The Business Information Management Dashboard was implemented in June 2020 to allow for real time business information to be accessible via its cloud-based dashboard.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe division's strategic plan to continue to explore expansion opportunities is strengthened with the completion of its acquisition of Dolomite Granite Quarry Sdn. Bhd. together with 4 parcels of leasehold lands and plants and machinery in  September  2020.  The  completion  of  the  acquisition bolstered the division's asset strength to a total of 9 quarries. Located in Hulu Langat, the Dolomite quarry site is one of the largest quarry in Klang Valley with approximately 784 acres in land areas and huge rock reserves which will contribute positively to the division's financial performance. Its close proximity to the bulk of infrastructure development and construction projects in vibrant Klang Valley will help to lower transportation costs and provide better earning margins for the division.\n\nIn line with the Group's sustainability ambition, the division continued  to  ensure  that  its  operation  processes  are carried out responsibly to minimise potential impacts on the environment. Among the environmentally sustainable practices completed during the year was the replacement of the burning source from Light Fuel Oil ('LFO') with Natural Gas at the Sungai Bakap asphalt manufacturing plant in July 2020. This will help the division in achieving cost-savings while significantly reducing harmful carbon emissions as substituting LFO with Natural Gas will help to reduce 45% less CO 2 emission per ton.\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nThe outlook for the quarry industry remains fluid and uncertain, with prospects of economic activity recovery pegged to the effectiveness of pandemic control and vaccines rollout. Barring any unforeseen circumstances,  the  division  anticipates  the  quarry  business  to experience a strong rebound alongside the recovery of the domestic economy.\n\nVenturing into 2021, the division's strategic priorities for the year remains on track to maintain its market leader position as the top asphalt manufacturing and aggregates operator in the country. The division will continue to explore opportunities to expand its market reach in Malaysia through new quarry sites or strategically located asphalt manufacturing plants.\n\nMaintaining its steadfast commitment to sustainability, the Quarry division has put in place plans to explore hydro seeding at one of its quarry sites to protect the rockface slope and greenery surrounding the quarry. Efforts are also underway to explore the use of renewable energy in its operations by replacing the existing electrical floodlights with solar floodlights for a lower carbon footprint and higher cost savings in the long run.\n\nAside from these growth drivers, the division also aims to kickstart its Integrated Management System ('IMS') for ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 process during the year. The IMS will help the division meet all the standards' requirements with an integrated set of policies and procedures for better efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nQuarry operation in Semenyih\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n101",

This  have  reduced  the demands for building materials in 2020, further compounded by the developers' low stock keeping practice to maintain liquidity.\n\nThe Building Materials division has seen an increase in competition in this tougher environment, with competitors aggressively retaining and expanding their customer base.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nThe Building Materials division activated its Business Continuity Plan ('BCP') to ensure minimal disruption to its business. With the BCP activated, the division took this opportunity to review and restructure its business processes.  Workflows were reviewed and enhanced for better efficiency, with teams reorganised to allow for multitasking. During the MCO lockdown, essential functions continue to operate while the sales team continue to engage customers and potential customers remotely.\n\nFinancially, the division operated in austerity mode in FY 2020 to manage cash flows and working capitals, by deferring large capital expenditure in view of the weak market demands. The Building Materials division was also more discerning in the types of projects it targeted, putting in stronger effort to engage more comprehensive supply  and  lay  projects  as  opposed  to  supply-only  jobs  (for interlocking concrete pavers projects). This is to ensure that the quality of completed jobs is done in accordance to high standards and deliver better value to the customers.\n\nThe division has intensified efforts into research and development ('R&D')  to  enhance  product  integrity  and  deliver  high-value products in keeping a step ahead of competitors. This includes the expansion of product portfolio for its pavers, offering new designs and specifications to better meet the needs of the market. Furthermore, the sales team continued its engagement efforts with stakeholders, introducing its products to potential customers through product knowledge sharing to communicate the higher quality and better value of the division's building materials.\n\nOne of the core strategic priorities of the division is to tap on digitalisation to derive greater value chain efficiencies. With the use of digital technologies, the division were able to enhance its business model, create new revenue streams and in the process, collect data to establish trends for better business decisions. The division is also actively looking to improvise its processes for further cost reduction through Artificial Intelligence ('AI') and Internet of Things ('IoT').\n\nThe division will continue its efforts to grow its market share for Spun Pile products with strong product integrity, high engagement with its current and potential customers and synergy effect on Sunway Group's strength and branding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 66 for more information on the Building Materials division's strategic profile.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe  division's  strategies  proved  fruitful  with  favourable results for its Interlocking Concrete Pavers ('ICP') and Vitrified Clay Pipes ('VCP') businesses. Sales volume for ICP especially, has been encouraging, recovering to preMCO levels in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. Well-managed cash flows, working capitals and lower overheads helped the division to recover its profitability in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the Building Materials division's ICP segment and  VCP  segment  continued  to  lead  the  market  with its  product  accreditations.  The  division's  ICP  products complied  to  the  recently  published  'Specification  and Guidelines  for  Interlocking  Concrete  Paving  Blocks' by JKR in January 2021, while the division was the first Malaysian manufacturer to achieve International Standard Specification EN295:2013 for its vitrified clay pipes, which further acknowledged its product integrity and enhanced its competitiveness, opening the ICP and VCP segment to new export markets and opportunities.\n\nAs  part  of  its  support  towards  realising  UNSDG  goals, the division has embarked on incorporating sustainable energy in its business. After the successful installation of rooftop Photovoltaic ('PV') solar panels at its VCP plant in  2019  which  contributed  positively  with  reduction  in energy  consumption  and  cost,  the  division  embarked on the installation of the PV solar panels at its spun piles Batang Kali plant in the fourth quarter of 2020. The project is  progressing  well  and  is  expected  to  be  completed in the first half of 2021. This will see the reduction of at least 178,933kg of CO 2 footprint and a 19.51% in annual electricity consumption savings benefitting the division.\n\nBatang Kali plant rooftop PV solar panels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nThe outlook for the building materials industry hinges on the efficient deployment and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in driving the recovery of the construction sector, and political stability and the current government policies to restore confidence in the country amid the challenging times for businesses to thrive again. The potential lift on travel restriction would allow the division to aggressively extend its reach to overseas markets.\n\nBarring  further  industry  shocks,  the  Building  Materials  division expects a gradual recovery in the business post MCO as construction resumes without the threat of interruption and more projects are put back in motion amid improved market sentiment.\n\nWith increased digitalisation as part of the new normal, this has opened up opportunities for the division to tap into new markets, especially regionally to expand sales, with the help of digital enablers. The fast pace of change forced by the pandemic has also reinforced the importance of faster adoption of emerging technologies. To ensure the division remains at the forefront of the building materials evolution,  the  team  will  continue  to  invest  time  and  effort  into R&D on products and manufacturing processes to enhance its competitiveness and provide new and exciting products of higher quality at greater manufacturing cost efficiency. These combined with a commitment to continue pursuing new untapped market of product conversion through engagement with potential and existing customers, will be the key strategic thrusts of the division going into 2021 and onwards.\n\nFlexipave Plus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n103",

The Group's founder and chairman, Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah, made sustainability an integral component of Sunway's business and decision-making processes, culminating in the Group's embrace of the 17 UNSDG in 2015.\n\nSunway defines sustainability as more than just 'going green'. In line with the path charted by the 17 UNSDG, the Group adopts a holistic and comprehensive approach to ensure sustainable longterm growth by leveraging innovation and technology to future proof the Group by strengthening both tangible and intangible values to withstand any challenges.

We stay committed towards building a sustainable future for all as we strive to embed sustainability in our business practices, processes and daily operations in our value creation journey.\n\nGuided  by  the  UNSDG  and  TCFD,  the  Group  reviewed  its sustainability approach this year by strengthening its sustainability governance and establishing a new set of future value goals and targets to build a sustainable future.\n\n## SUNWAY BERHAD BOARD SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE\n\nTan Sri Dato' (Dr.) Chew Chee Kin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSarena Cheah Yean Tih\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDatuk Tong Poh Keow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilip Yeo Liat Kok\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway Berhad's sustainability governance is led by the Group's Board  Sustainability  Committee  ('BSC'),  which  comprises  four Directors  from  the  Group's  Board  of  Directors.  The  BSC  was established in 2020 to review, supervise and recommend Sunway's sustainability  strategy  and  issues,  key  environment,  social  and governance  ('ESG')  targets  and  performance,  progress  and scorecard to advance the Group's sustainability leadership. The BSC plans to meet at least twice a year to review Sunway's sustainability plans.\n\nTo  further  strengthen  our  sustainability  strategy,  the  BSC  is supported by the Sunway Group Sustainability Department ('SSS') and the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development ('JSC'), which acts as the Advisory Panel to the BSC. The JSC also supports the SSS with findings from their academic research.\n\nActing as the 'executive arm' of the BSC, the SSS helps the BSC to make informed decisions to integrate the Group's sustainability strategies into business operations and implement initiatives towards achieving the Group's sustainability goals. The SSS also oversees and monitors sustainability trends, governance and reporting besides overseeing key sustainability risks and opportunities, stakeholder engagement as well as materiality assessment. The SSS chairs the Sustainability Committee ('SC'), and communicates the Group's sustainability direction to the SC.\n\nThe SC comprises the business divisons Heads of Department and their line managers, who are accountable for their ESG performances that are linked to their remuneration and appraisal.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nBoard Sustainability\n\nCommittee ('BSC')\n\nSunway Group\n\nSustainability\n\nDepartment ('SSS')\n\nSustainability Committee ('SC') across all Business Units and Group Functions\n\nAdvisory Panel\n\nThe Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development ('JSC')\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AT SUNWAY\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## GROUP OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis policy sets out Sunway's commitment to achieving excellence  in  providing  a  safe  and  healthy  working environment for its employees and external stakeholders.\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\n\nThis  policy  sets  out  the  scope,  commitment  and implementation  of  human  rights  practices  within Sunway. The oversight of the policy is led by the Board of  Directors,  Board  Sustainability  Committee,  Group Internal Audit and Group Human Resources.\n\nAdditional information on Sunway Group's policies can be found on the company's website at www.sunway.com.my.\n\nSunway's commitment to sustainability and core values are key to Sunway's growth and expansion over the years. The very founding of  the  Sunway  Group  is  based  on  the  concept  of  sustainable development,  beginning  with  the  transformation  of  its  flagship Sunway City Kuala Lumpur from a wasteland into a wonderland.\n\nDespite  the  unprecedented  challenges  that  caused  significant disruptions  to  the  businesses,  Sunway's  commitment  to  its sustainability  journey  remained  firm.  The  challenges,  in  fact, strengthened  its  commitment  and  accelerated  its  sustainable development  agenda,  building  resiliency  and  drive  the  Group towards meeting its goals.\n\nWithin the environmental pillar, tree planting, energy efficiency, renewable energy and waste management led to a reduction in CO 2 e emissions by 11,611 tonnes. This was mainly contributed by some of the Group's robust environmental initiatives, one of which was the installation of solar energy panels. In 2020, the solar energy contribution has increased from 1% to 3%, generated 7,408 MWh equivalent of energy.\n\nDuring the year, Sunway has recorded a 28% reduction in water consumption compared to 2019 and recorded 538,706 m\u00b3 of water sourced from water treatment plants. The lower water consumption was primarily due to lower business activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Group has diverted 4% of waste from landfills through on-going food composting and recycling of e-waste initiatives.\n\nOn the social impact front, Sunway maintained a track record of zero reported incidents of human rights violations and discrimination, including forced labour and child labour. In 2020, Sunway Lagoon Theme Park was ISO 45001:2018 certified. It is the target for all business divisions, where relevant, to be certified by 2030. These certifications promote higher emphasis towards staff safety, reduce workplace risks and ensure better and safer working conditions.\n\nIn  addition,  Sunway  empowers  the  local  communities  through its  #SunwayforGood  programme  which  is  designed  to  cultivate entrepreneurial skills among the underprivileged to enable them to be financially independent.\n\nIn responding to the impact of COVID-19, Sunway contributed to communities in need and those whose incomes were affected by the pandemic, together with the frontliners who worked tirelessly to fight the spread of the virus. To ensure continuous access to healthcare services,  Sunway  Medical  Centre  offered  selected  consultation services through phone calls, virtual clinics, a medication delivery service and COVID-19 on-site testing.\n\nSunway  advocates  strong  corporate  governance  by  upholding the core value of integrity, ensuring honesty and trustworthiness amongst  employees  in  pursuit  of  excellence  for  an  exemplary organisation in Asia. Sunway employees held true to the value of Integrity and recorded zero incidents of bribery and corruption in 2020, an achievement which the Group targets to maintain.\n\nSunway will continue to leverage the strengths of the ecosystem and uphold its core values, as part of the endeavour to achieve the goals and targets by 2030 to build a sustainable future for all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to the Sustainability Report 2020 for the full contents.\n\nDeveloping a Safe, Equal and Dignified Workforce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GROUP SUSTAINABILITY POLICY\n\nThis  policy  guides  the  execution  of  sustainability across the Group and sets out the scope, commitment and principles of Sunway with regard to sustainable development.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT POLICY\n\nThe Sustainable Procurement Policy was established in 2020 to ensure a best practice approach to sustainable procurement.

Tan Sri Jamaludin Bin Ibrahim was appointed as a member of the AC on 3 March 2021. All of them were Independent Non-Executive Directors. The AC Chairman is a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.\n\nThe Company has a policy of requiring a former key audit partner to observe a cooling-off period of at least 3 years before being appointed as a member of the AC.\n\nThe AC has explicit authority to investigate any matter within its TOR. Management provides their fullest co-operation in providing information and resources, and in implementing or carrying out all requests made by the AC. The AC has direct access to the Internal and External Auditors and full discretion to invite any executive officer to attend its meetings. Similarly, both the Internal and External Auditors have unrestricted access to the AC.\n\nIn the financial year 2020, the AC met the External Auditors separately twice on 25 February 2020 and 7 April 2020 without the presence of the Management. It also had a private session with the Internal Auditors without the presence of the Management on 27 May 2020. The AC had discussed with the Auditors on the reasonableness of the financial reporting process, the system of internal controls and Management's level of co-operation in the audit process. The AC also took note of comments and recommendations made by both the Internal and External Auditors.\n\nIn assessing the suitability of the External Auditors, the AC is guided by the Policy on Selection of External Auditors.

The Board through the RMC, has received assurances from the President and Group Chief Financial Officer that the risk management framework and internal control systems of the Group are operating adequately and effectively.\n\nRegular assessments on the adequacy and integrity of the internal controls and monitoring of compliance with policies and procedures are also carried out through internal audit exercises.

During  the  financial  year  2020,  prior  to  the  travel restriction imposed in March 2020 by the Government to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company had participated in a physical road show in Singapore. Since then, the Company had participated in  various  virtual  investor  conferences  organised  by  investment banks.\n\n## II.  CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS\n\nThe  Board  encourages  shareholders'  participation  in  general meetings. The AGM of the Company provides a principal forum for shareholders to share their views. It also provides open dialogue opportunity and interaction between the Board and the shareholders. The participation of shareholders, both individuals and institutions at  general  meetings  on  clarifications  of  pertinent  and  relevant information is encouraged.\n\nIn  providing  a  more  efficient  and  wide-spread  shareholders' participation, the Company has introduced online polling. Due to the pandemic in 2020, the Company had conducted its 10 th AGM and Extraordinary General Meeting (' EGM ') on a fully virtual basis through live streaming and online remote voting using the Remote Participation  and  Voting  (' RPV ')  facility.  The  virtual  meetings had enabled shareholders to participate remotely and safely from wherever they were. A shareholder who was not able to participate in the AGM/EGM was given the option of appointing a proxy to participate remotely and vote online on his/her behalf.\n\nIn 2020, the Company served notice of its 10 th AGM more than 28 days before the meeting, well in advance of the 21-day requirement under the Companies Act 2016 and the Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities. The additional time given to the shareholders had allowed them to have sufficient time to scrutinise the Annual Report 2019 and to make necessary registration to participate in the virtual meeting. It had also given a 21-day notice for its EGM in 2020. The Company also distributed together with the notice of 10 th AGM and EGM, an Administrative Guide, which furnished useful information regarding the conduct of the 10 th AGM/EGM such as details of the virtual meeting, shareholders' entitlement to participate and vote in the virtual meeting, their right to appoint proxy, steps and procedures to access and vote in the virtual AGM/EGM. Shareholders who are not able to participate in the meeting are allowed to appoint any person(s) as their proxies to participate, speak and vote in his or her stead at all the general meetings.\n\nAt the commencement of the 10 th AGM, the President presented a visual overview of the performance of the Group and its core businesses for the financial year 2019 as well as the prospect of the Group. As for the EGM, a representative from RHB Investment Bank Berhad, the Principal Adviser, presented the details of the corporate proposals tabled at the EGM for the shareholders' understanding.\n\nThe  Chairman  provided  ample  time  and  opportunities  for  the Questions and Answers sessions during the AGM and EGM. All the Directors together with the President, GCFO, management team and External Auditors were present to respond to all queries raised. In addition, the Principal Adviser and solicitor were also present at the EGM to answer any questions asked. Shareholders were also encouraged to send in their questions prior to the AGM/EGM via email or through the online platform provided by the Company's Share  Registrar.  All  suggestions  and  comments  given  by  the shareholders were also noted by Management for consideration.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT\n\n## II.  CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS\n\nIn addition, written queries raised by the Minority Shareholder Watch Group were presented to the shareholders at the general meetings together with the Group's response.\n\nAll resolutions set out in the notice of the 10 th AGM and EGM were voted remotely by poll. Messrs BDO Consulting Sdn Bhd, an independent scrutineer validated the votes for each resolution. The Company's Share Registrar, Sunway Management Sdn Bhd was the Polling Administrator for the conduct of the online polling.\n\nThe minutes of the 10 th AGM and EGM are made available on the Company's website at www.sunway.com.my for the information of the public.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES IN 2020\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY & CORRUPTION\n\nThe Board has established an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Task Force (' ABC Taskforce ') in 2019 to implement Group wide awareness and compliance programme as well as to strengthen the internal processes and practices. During the financial year 2020, trainings and communications of the ABC policy had been carried out involving all directors, employees, associates and business partners.\n\nAn Anti-Bribery and Corruption Compliance Officer had been appointed to take charge of monitoring compliance going forward.\n\n## BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN\n\nDuring the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had severely disrupted the economy and business operations of the Group. In order to ensure business continuity, the Group had to take drastic and expeditious actions to contain costs, revise its strategies, and to assess its operational risks as well as review its supply chain impact.\n\nA Business Continuity Plan (' BCP ') was formulated and presented to the Board on 7 April 2020 by the Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe main objectives of the BCP were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Protect the organisation against adverse effects of the pandemic;\n- \u00b7 Prepare the Group for inevitable threats;\n- \u00b7  Respond immediately to warning signals of crisis i.e. detect early signs, identify problem areas; and\n- \u00b7  Manage and ensure appropriate actions are carried out based on current impact of event, as well as potential risks including mitigation strategies.\n\nA Crisis Management Team (' CMT ') was quickly formed comprising top management to carry out the BCP action plan. The members of the CMT communicated actively using online technology platforms during the movement control order (' MCO '), Conditional MCO and Recovery MCO period.\n\nConsequent to the proactive and relentless efforts of the Management and all members of the Group, the Group was able to mitigate and continue its operations notwithstanding the effects of the pandemic.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Overview Statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDato' Sri Idris Jala\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Co-Chairman\n\n147",

GIAD helps the Group to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach  to  evaluate  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  risk management, internal controls and governance processes. GIAD reports functionally to the AC and administratively to the Executive Chairman.\n\nGIAD is headed by Mr Yee Meng Haw who is a member of the Malaysian  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountant  (MICPA),  a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) and a Chartered Member of the Institute of Internal Auditors Malaysia (CMIIA).\n\nGIAD has 21 auditors and all of the auditors have either tertiary or  professional  qualifications.  Some  are  members  of  Certified Information  System  Auditors  (CISA),  Certified  Fraud  Examiners (CFE) and Certified Internal Auditor (CIA). The Head of GIAD and the auditors have confirmed that they are free from any relationships\n\nor  conflicts  of  interest  which  could  impair  their  objectivity  and independence in their audit assignments.\n\nGIAD is a member of the Malaysian Chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors ( 'IIA' ) and adopts the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing ( 'IIA Standards' ) laid down in the International Professional Practices Framework issued by the IIA. GIAD successfully completed its external Quality Assessment Review in 2015 and continues to meet or exceed the IIA Standards in all key aspects. GIAD was originally scheduled to undertake another external Quality Assessment Review in 2020 but this has been postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. GIAD carried out its activities based on a risk-based annual audit plan approved by the AC. The AC reviews annually the adequacy of the scope, function and resources of the IA, to ensure that the responsibilities of GIAD are fully discharged.\n\nThe internal audit reports arising from the audit assignments carried out in 2020 were issued to the respective business unit management for their responses and Management were made responsible to ensure that the agreed corrective actions to be taken to address the reported risks and weaknesses were taken promptly within the required timeframes. Follow-up audit engagements were carried out by GIAD to ensure that the key corrective actions were implemented appropriately.

The Board embeds risk management into activities, initiatives and processes of Sunway and its subsidiaries ('the Group'). The framework has been set in place by the Board to identify, evaluate, mitigate and monitor key risks faced by the Group.\n\nThe framework is designed to mitigate risks or events with significant adverse impact on the achievement of the Group's objectives and strategies. As such, it provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material financial misstatement and management information and records, or against financial losses or fraud. This statement does not cover associate companies and joint ventures where risk management and internal controls are managed by the respective management teams.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee ('RMC'), comprising of independent directors in majority and as its Chairman oversees the Group's risk management and internal control. Accountable to the Board of Directors, the RMC meets quarterly to:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify, assess and monitor key business risks and review risk mitigation strategies;\n- \u00b7 Review and recommend risk management strategies, policies and levels of risk tolerance; and\n- \u00b7 Ensure infrastructure, resources and systems are in place to manage risks.\n\nIn 2020, the RMC has duly reviewed, appraised and assessed the efficacy of the controls and progress of action plans taken to mitigate, monitor and manage the Group's risk exposure. RMC had subsequently provided assurance to the Board that the Group's risk management framework and internal controls are operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nPlanning, monitoring and review of the Group's performance and conduct are done via scheduled periodic meetings of the Board, Board Committees and management. The annual Business Plan ensures that all divisions and operating subsidiaries prepare and present respective outlook, expectations, budgets, performance and targets for the forthcoming year.\n\nThe President communicates the Board's expectations to management teams and employees during management meetings, managers' conferences, e-mail announcements and forums while the heads of operating subsidiaries and departments are empowered with the responsibility of planning, monitoring, reporting and managing their respective operations. The Group seeks to proactively review and evaluate existing corporate governance practices and internal control policies where best practices, improvements and changes are recommended to the Board of Directors for adoption and implementation.\n\n## COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n1\n\n## POLICIES & PROCEDURES\n\nThe Group's internal control system includes clear, formalised and documented internal policies, standards and procedures to ensure compliance with internal controls and relevant laws and regulations. It enables all divisions and operating subsidiaries to effectively and efficiently, operate and respond proactively to potential business, operational, financial, compliance and other risks in achieving the Group's goals and objectives. These documents are regularly reviewed to ensure relevance and applicability and are published in the Group's portals for employees' reference.\n\nOther policies, standards and procedures that are made available to enhance the Group's operational efficiency include:\n\n- \u00b7 Anti-Bribery and Corruption\n- \u00b7 Group Sustainable Development Policy\n- \u00b7 Anti-Money Laundering Policy\n- \u00b7 Whistle Blowing Policy & Procedure\n- \u00b7 Diversity & Inclusion Policy\n- \u00b7 Group Occupational Health, Safety & Environment Policy\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Policy\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Procurement Policy\n- \u00b7 Fraud Response\n- \u00b7 Compliance Function\n- \u00b7 Integrity Pact\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct and Business Ethics\n- \u00b7 Staff Handbook\n- \u00b7 Industrial Relations\n- \u00b7 Personal Data Protection Act\n- \u00b7 Learning & Development\n\n## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## AUDITS\n\nThe Group Internal Audit Department ('GIAD') carries out internal audits on divisions and operating units of the Group based on a risk-based audit plan approved annually by the Audit Committee ('AC'). Based on these audits, GIAD provides the AC with periodic reports highlighting observations, recommendations and action plans to improve the Group's internal control system. The AC reviews and deliberates on any matters relating to internal control highlighted by the External Auditors in the course of their statutory audit of the financial statements of the Group. Additionally, subsidiaries accredited with certifications are audited as scheduled by auditors of relevant certification bodies. Results of these audits are reported to management.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Group's risk management framework is benchmarked against the ISO31000:2018 Risk Management - Guidelines and is designed to embed Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') into key activities, initiatives and processes of the Group. This enables the Group to identify, evaluate, mitigate and monitor risks that may prevent the Group from achieving its objectives. In doing so, the stakeholders are assured that their interest is protected. During the financial year, the Group constantly reinforces its risk management framework to remain relevant and effective given the present business environment.\n\nThe framework is enterprise-wide and outlines policies and practices for effective risk mitigation. It allows the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish clear functional responsibilities and accountabilities within committee structures for management of risks;\n- \u00b7 enhance and improve corporate governance with a clear, concise and robust structure for the Group;\n- \u00b7  determine risk appetite and risk tolerance based on measurable parameters related to critical risks that may impact the strategy, performance and reputation of the Group;\n- \u00b7 set risk policies and limits consistent with the risk appetite and tolerance of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 ensure appropriate skills and resources are applied to risk management.\n\nContinuous risk assessment is fundamental to the Group's risk management process. Operating subsidiaries are tasked with reporting major risks on a quarterly basis to management as it aims for a holistic approach towards risk management. The respective operating subsidiaries being risk owners of their immediate sphere are responsible to develop the appropriate response strategies to mitigate risks.\n\nIn providing assurance to the RMC and the Board, Group Risk Management Department ('GRMD'), continues to review the quarterly risk reports in identifying and mitigating all major risks of the operating subsidiaries under the Group. The quarterly risks from all operating subsidiaries are consolidated and updated to the Group Chief Financial Officer, President and RMC, highlighting major risks and mitigating controls carried out.\n\nThe Group has four (4) core response strategies for risk management. These include:\n\n## a. Risk Termination\n\nIn this instance, management chooses to terminate risks by eliminating the business or by significantly altering it. The Group may choose this route for risks that could have major or catastrophic impact on its businesses.\n\n## b. Risk Reduction\n\nRisks may be reduced by taking specific actions aimed at reducing the likelihood of occurrence, thus reducing the impact of these risks on the Group's businesses.\n\n## c. Risk Acceptance\n\nManagement may choose not to act and to consciously accept certain risks which are significantly low in likelihood of occurrence and/or impact. Factors to consider for risks of such nature would be:\n\n- \u00b7 Adequacy of current controls;\n- \u00b7 Quality and quantity of information on the controls;\n- \u00b7 Likelihood and consequences of the risk occurring; and\n- \u00b7 The cost of additional controls\n\n## d. Risk Transfer\n\nManagement may choose to transfer all or part of a certain risk to other parties via:\n\n- \u00b7 Transferring an entire business process to another party as is the case with sub-contracting and outsourcing arrangements;\n- \u00b7 Sharing the business process with another party as is the case with partnerships and joint venture arrangements; and\n- \u00b7  Retaining the process and transferring the legal and financial risks as is the case with insurance arrangements and the use of certain treasury/financial products.\n\nRisk management discipline ensures that risk assessment is an on-going process whereby risks and risk mitigation measures are regularly reviewed and adjusted accordingly. The continuous risk assessment process therefore, represents the cornerstone of an effective ERM program for the Group.",

Internal control and risk related matters are recommended by the AC and RMC to the Board for deliberation or approval while matters and decisions made within the purviews of the AC and RMC are escalated to the Board for its notation. Significant issues arising from changes in business environment are reviewed continuously to ensure minimal impact to the Group. The Group positions its business units towards a profitable objective while incorporating risk management principles into its functions and processes.\n\nGRMD is accountable for effectiveness of the risk management framework and is independently distinguished from risk owners - the respective heads of operating subsidiaries being such person with vital insight of respective businesses and able to actively influence the identified risks through decisions and actions.\n\nConsequently, GRMD undertakes the role of assisting operating subsidiaries by identifying, quantifying, managing and mitigating critical risks in addition to monitoring and reporting of action plans prepared by the operating subsidiaries. In line with the Group's governance initiatives, GRMD also collaborates with other support functions such as Group Brand Marketing & Communication, Group Finance, Group Internal Audit, Group IT, Group Legal, Group Procurement, Group Secretarial and Corporate Development.\n\nGRMD continues to support the Group's efforts in embracing change and evolution into a resilient conglomerate, allowing it to refine its focus and strategies to achieve goals and objectives while sustaining an ecological balance between employees, communities and environment. Thus, as the Group commits to provide Occupational, Safety & Health standards and practices to enhance stakeholders' value, GRMD's quarterly risk reporting exercise with operating subsidiaries goes beyond risk mitigation to ensure that operational processes are consistent and remain compliant with relevant standards such as Occupational Health and Safety Management Certification ('OHSAS'), International Standardization for Organization ('ISO'), Australian Council of Healthcare Standards ('ACHS') and the Malaysian Society for Quality in Health ('MSQH') to name a few.\n\nApart from the above, GRMD participates in other value-adding exercises such as:\n\n## 1.  Review existing Sunway Standard Operating Principles ('SSOP')\n\nThe review of the Group's SSOPs is conducted by GRMD together with key relevant personnel from respective divisions or operating subsidiaries, covering credit control, sales and marketing, procurement, products and services and operative guidelines.\n\n## 2.  Assist in day-to-day operations for operating subsidiaries\n\nUpon instruction from management, GRMD assists in fulfilling daily operative requirements to ensure minimal business interruption or delays that could hamper the achievement of goals and objectives.\n\n## 3.  Assist in conducting regulatory and risk-based research\n\nSuch research is conducted to ensure that the Group's projects and businesses (existing or new) remain compliant to laws and regulations.\n\n## 4.  Assist in conducting tender for divisions and operating subsidiaries\n\nGRMD participates in tender processes to form an independent party to ensure fairness in observance of due process, decision making and tender awards.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nRisk Management Committee, assisted by Group Risk Management Department\n\n## Reporting Divisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Property Development\n- \u00b7 Trading and Manufacturing\n- \u00b7 Property Investment and REIT\n- \u00b7 Quarry\n- \u00b7 Leisure\n- \u00b7 Building Materials\n- \u00b7 Construction\n- \u00b7 Investment Holdings\n- \u00b7 Healthcare\n- \u00b7 Others\n- \u00b7 Hospitality\n\n## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n## KEY RISK FACTORS\n\nFor the financial year under review, the following risks were most prevalent among business units in the Group. These were presented to the RMC where controls, mitigating plans and monitoring mechanisms were highlighted.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## EXTERNAL RISKS\n\nThe year 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic which has severely impacted global food security, public health, employment, workers' health and safety and other social disruptions. Mindful of the current global COVID-19 pandemic and economic uncertainties, the Group continues to formalise strategies to remain resilient by adopting a myriad of strategies to provide value added products and services that are competitively priced while maintaining competitive advantage via flexible procurement of supplies, self-sustaining resources and continuous exploration of new businesses.\n\nGlobal warming and extreme weather change has brought about unexpected natural disasters and will continuously pose as a risk on natural resources and the health and safety of communities. Hence, the Group's effort and journey in sustainability aims to cascade and drive climate and environment policies, operations and management of natural resources, energy, utilities, environment, bio-diversity, waste, greenhouse gas emissions and alternative resources. As a result, the Group's business practices are driven by core values of sustainability to build integrated townships that are efficient, self-sustaining and eco-friendly to prevent further erosion towards the environment.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nIn mitigating the risks brought about by the pandemic, the Group's business units paid significant attention towards aspects of health and safety, delivery of products and services, disaster recovery, infrastructure and production.\n\nAll business premises practice strict adherence to the latest government approved Standard Operating Procedures ('SOPs') and guidelines. Compliance to these rules are mandatory to our stakeholders - customers, local communities, tenants, employees, contractors, suppliers and other affiliates while task force or crisis management teams are set up at business unit levels to conduct identification and contact tracing for positive cases, disinfection and notifications to the Ministry of Health, media and stakeholders.\n\nCrucial measures undertaken include:\n\n- \u00b7 Thermal and self check-in scanners at all entrances;\n- \u00b7  Social distancing in office, public areas, suraus, dining areas and elevators;\n- \u00b7 Increased disinfecting frequency of high-touch points;\n- \u00b7  Work-from-home arrangements or alternate teams for crucial services and functions; and\n- \u00b7  Virtual meetings and trainings to minimise physical contact.\n\n## CYBER & IT SECURITY\n\nSince the turn of the millennia, the Group has been proactive in bridging the digital and communications gap in its businesses from operations to finances and production. Focus areas include platform development of applications, infrastructure, resource planning, performance management, supply chain management and human capital management.\n\nWith businesses becoming more digitally connected, mitigation of cyber security risks and data governance is vital in ensuring a holistic approach in ensuring a robust, secure, effective and efficient IT environment. The Sunway E-Policy applies to the entire Group and encompasses areas such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Acceptable Use\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Communications\n- \u00b7 Clear Desk and Screen\n- \u00b7 Password Management\n- \u00b7 Malicious Code Protection\n- \u00b7 Compliance\n- \u00b7 Security and Control\n\n157",

Together with GRMD, relevant departments and business units continuously engage in discussions to ensure that the Group's policies and procedures remain compliant, relevant, applicable and to reduce the Group's exposure to potential legal liabilities and minimise any adverse impact arising from non-compliance of such changes.\n\nThe Group adopts a zero tolerance policy against all forms of bribery and corruption and remains committed to ensure that businesses do not participate in corrupt activities and to implement adequate procedures effectively to comply with the provisions of Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (Amendment 2018).

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## (a) Revenue recognition for property development\n\nRevenue from property development during the financial year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is RM478.5 million.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in determining the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocations and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.\n\nThe Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of contracts. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations.\n\nThe Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. In estimating the total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) reviewed contracts with customers to identify distinct and material performance obligations, and compared our findings to the findings of the Group;\n- (ii) assessed estimated total costs to complete through inquiries with operational and financial personnel of the Group;\n- (iii)  inspected documentation to support cost estimates made including contract variations and cost contingencies;\n- (iv)  compared contract budgets to actual outcomes to assess reliability of management budgeting process and controls; and\n- (v)   recomputed the results of the input method determined by management for revenue recognition based on verified actual costs incurred to-date and budgeted costs.\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)\n\n## Key Audit Matters (contd.)\n\n## (b) Revenue recognition for construction contracts\n\nRevenue from construction contracts during the financial year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is RM942.7 million.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations and determining whether there is any exposure to liquidated ascertained damages ('LAD'). The progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations is measured using the output method, which is based on contract work certified to date over the estimated total contract sum.\n\nIn estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations, the Group considers the estimated contract work completed to date and the completeness and accuracy of its estimated total contract sum, including contract variations, claims and contingencies.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) inspected documentation to support the estimated total contract sum and correspondences from contract customers in relation to variations and claims to corroborate key judgements applied by management;\n- (ii) inspected documentation certified by professional consultants to support the contract work performed by the Group to-date;\n- (iii) recomputed the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations determined by management for revenue recognition based on contract work certified to-date and budgeted total contract sum;\n- (iv)   inquired in-house operational and financial personnel of the Group to assess the merits of extension of time submitted to the contract customers for assessing the exposure to LAD; and\n- (v)   inspected relevant correspondences and reports, including on-going negotiations with contract customers for the late delivery of contract works.\n\n## (c) Recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of Group with carrying amounts of RM289.5 million and RM375.6 million respectively as disclosed in Note 15 and Note 38 to the financial statements. In addition, the Group had also recognised gain on reassessments and modifications of leases amounted to RM46.4 million as disclosed in Note 38 to the financial statements.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements for specific assumptions applied in determining right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as well as lease reassessments and modifications. The specific assumptions include the determination of appropriate discount rates, variable lease payments and assessment of lease terms, including renewal and termination options of the leases.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of key controls pertaining to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities;\n- (ii)   assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions applied in determining variable lease payments, lease reassessments and modifications based on the lease contracts and relevant inputs;\n- (iii)   assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates applied in determining lease liabilities based on the lease contracts and relevant inputs;\n- (iv)   assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions applied in determining the lease terms of the lease liabilities, including renewal and termination options of the leases;\n- (v)   verified the accuracy of the underlying lease data by agreeing a representative sample of leases to original contracts or other supporting information; and\n- (vi)  assessed the appropriateness of applying the requirements of Amendment to MFRS 16 COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions.",

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)\n\n## Key Audit Matters (contd.)\n\n## (d) Prior years adjustments\n\nThe Group and the Company had restated their comparatives for the financial year ended 31 December 2019, including their opening statements of financial position as at 1 January 2019 via prior year adjustments retrospectively resulting from the reassessment of the Group's and the Company's involvement in their investments in wholesale funds, which were determined, in substance, as structured entities under their control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements as disclosed in Note 2 and Note 55 to the financial statements.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in determining whether the investments in wholesale funds are, in substance, structured entities under the control of the Group and the Company in accordance with MFRS 10, taking into consideration their power over the wholesale funds, exposure or rights to variable returns from their involvement with the wholesale funds and their ability to use their power over the wholesale funds to affect the amount of their returns.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) reviewed the relevant information memorandums and trust deeds of the respective wholesale funds to assess the terms and conditions of the wholesale funds;\n- (ii) obtained confirmations from the fund managers of the wholesale funds and inspected the relevant documentation in relation to the underlying investments in these wholesale funds;\n- (iii)   inquired management, treasury personnel and external legal counsels of the Group on its assessment of the Group's and the Company's control over their wholesale funds and the basis of consolidation of the wholesale funds in accordance with MFRS 10;\n- (iv)   engaged our legal expert to assess the legal and accounting aspects relating to the Group's and the Company's control over the wholesale funds and the basis of consolidation of the wholesale funds by the Group based on the nature, facts and circumstances of the investments in these wholesale funds of the Group and of the Company in accordance with MFRS 10; and\n- (v)   assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements are appropriate in light of the requirements of MFRS 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.\n\n## INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS' REPORT THEREON\n\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with MFRSs, IFRSs and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)\n\n## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- (a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- (b)   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control of the Group and of the Company.\n- (c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.\n- (d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- (e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- (f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 50 to the financial statements.\n\n179",

CORPORATE INFORMATION\n\nSunway Berhad ('the Company') is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The principal place of business and registered office of the Company are located at Level 16, Menara Sunway, Jalan Lagoon Timur, Bandar Sunway, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan.\n\nThe principal activities of the Company are investment holding and provision of management services.\n\nThe principal activities of the subsidiaries are set out in Note 50 to the financial statements.\n\nThe immediate and ultimate holding companies of the Company are Sungei Way Corporation Sdn. Bhd. and Active Equity Sdn. Bhd. respectively, both of which are incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nThe financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2021.\n\n## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ('MFRSs'), International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.\n\nThe new MFRSs and amendments to MFRSs adopted during the financial year are set out in Note 53(a) to the financial statements.\n\nDuring the current financial year, following the reassessment of the Group's and the Company's involvement in their investments in wholesale funds, the Group and the Company determined that their placement in wholesale funds are in substance, structured entities under their control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements as disclosed in Note 19(d) to the financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, the Group has consolidated these wholesale funds in the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 and the Group and the Company have restated their comparatives via prior year adjustments retrospectively.\n\nIn relation to this, comparative figures of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 in these financial statements, including their opening statements of financial position as at 1 January 2019, have been restated to give effect to the above reassessment as disclosed in Note 55 to the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as otherwise stated in the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ('RM'), which is also the functional currency of the Company. All financial information presented in RM has been rounded to the nearest thousand ('RM'000'), unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe Group has significant positive cash flows from its overall business operations and has adequate undrawn credit facilities available to meet its operational and funding requirements (as further disclosed in Note 4(b) to the financial statements under liquidity risk), notwithstanding that the Group is in a net current liabilities position of RM883.7 million as at 31 December 2020. As the net current liabilities position is mainly due to the short term bank borrowings, the Group plans to reduce its quantum and refinance it with longer term bank loans and longer dated corporate bonds in the near term.\n\nThe Group has carried out cash flows review for the next twelve (12) months to ensure that its business operations have sufficient liquidity and funds available to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In addition to the undrawn credit facilities, the Group can also tap its available balances of Medium Term Notes and Perpetual Sukuk programmes to refinance its short term borrowings according to the liquidity requirements of the Group.\n\nThe Directors are confident that the Group will continue to operate profitably and generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, together with continuous financial support from the lenders.\n\n197",

CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## (a)   Capital management\n\nThe primary objective of the Group's and the Company's capital management is the maintenance of a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios, in order to support the Group's businesses and maximising shareholders' value.\n\nThe Group and the Company manage their capital structure by ensuring that financial commitments are met as and when they fall due. In addition, divestment of the Group's non-core assets, which provides low returns are also made to optimise the capital structure of the Group.\n\nThe Group and the Company monitor capital utilisation using the gearing ratio. This ratio is used to assess the appropriateness of the Group's debt level, hence its capital structure. The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt includes total borrowings net of cross currency swap, and perpetual sukuk less cash and bank balances.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 4.

The Company has complied with this requirement for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## (b) Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group's financial risk management policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Group's businesses whilst managing its interest rate risks (both fair value and cash flow), foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken except for the use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost-efficient.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's and the Company's income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group's and the Company's interest-bearing financial assets are mainly short term in nature and have been mostly placed in fixed deposits and deposits with other financial institutions.\n\nThe Group's and the Company's interest rate risk arise primarily from interest bearing borrowings. The Group manages its interest rate exposure by monitoring a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group also entered into interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the floating rate interest payable on certain borrowings. The Group closely monitors markets and output from various industry working groups on the transitions to new interest rate benchmark arising from the respective interest rate benchmarks reforms in various jurisdictions. At the end of the reporting period, the Group's interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts are not affected by any interest rate benchmarks reforms. Approximately 66% (2019: 77%) of the Group's borrowings after cross currency swap are at fixed rates of interest.\n\nThe interest rate profile and sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk have been disclosed in Notes 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.",

CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b)   Financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is not significantly exposed to foreign currency risk as the majority of the Group's transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in Ringgit Malaysia ('RM') except for foreign currency risk arising from countries in which certain foreign subsidiaries operate. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Singapore Dollar ('SGD'), United States Dollar ('USD'), Chinese Renminbi ('RMB'), Australian Dollar ('AUD') and British Pound Sterling ('GBP'). Foreign currency exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the operating entities are kept to an acceptable level.\n\nApproximately 15% (2019: 10%) of the Group's sales are denominated in foreign currencies whilst almost 9% (2019: 10%) of costs are denominated in the respective functional currencies of the Group entities.\n\nThe Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by borrowing in the currency of the country in which the property or investment is located or by borrowing in currencies that match the revenue stream to be generated from its investments.\n\nThe Group also holds cash and bank balances denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes. At the end of the reporting period, such foreign currency balances amounted to RM208.0 million (2019: RM203.5 million).\n\nMaterial foreign currency transactions exposures are hedged, mainly with derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.\n\nThe Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings as well as to minimise the interest cost. These cross currency swap contracts have expiry periods within 3 months to 12 months (2019: 3 month to 7 months).\n\nIn relation to its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risks and which are held for long term investment purposes, the differences arising from such translation are recorded under the foreign currency translation reserve. These translation differences are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\nAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\nCAPIT\n\n4.\n\nFinancial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)\n\n(b)\n\nForeign currency risk (contd.)\n\nForeign currency risk exposure\n\nThe currency risk exposure profiles for each class of financial instruments are as follows:\n\n## SGD USD RMB AUD GBP Others Group <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000 <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000 <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000 <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000 <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000 <1 year RM'000 >1 year RM'000\n\n| -          | -          | -           | -                   | -       | -                  |\n|------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|---------|--------------------|\n|            |            | (21,310)    | -                   | -       | -                  |\n| 18,955     | 21,643     |             |                     |         |                    |\n| -          | -          | -           | (74,433)            | -       | (74,433)           |\n| 11,686     |            |             | (232,985)           |         |                    |\n|            | 1,421      | (9,071)     |                     | -       | (232,985)          |\n| -          | 6,285      |             |                     | -       | (23,336)           |\n| 33,333     |            | -           | (23,336)            |         | (1,714)            |\n|            | 5,066      | (4,703)     |                     | 265,417 |                    |\n| -          | -          | -           | -                   | -       | -                  |\n|            |            |             | (267,131)           |         |                    |\n| 56,825     | 65,860     | (50,234)    | -                   | -       | -                  |\n| 48,039   - | -          | -           | -                   | -       | -                  |\n|            | 1,812      | (2,779)     | (972,146)           | 972,146 | -                  |\n| -          |            |             |                     | -       |                    |\n| 39,112     | 88,106   - | (10,034)  - | (150,368)  (67,203) | -       | (150,368) (67,203) |",

The objective of the Group is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of standby credit facilities.\n\nThe objective of the Group's liquidity management is to maintain a balance between long term and short term borrowings to ensure continuity of funding at a cost efficient manner to meet its financial obligations on a timely basis. In this regard, the Group diligently manages its debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and various sources of funding after taking into account of the refinancing, repayment and funding requirements to provide an adequate liquidity buffer. Besides maintaining a reasonable level of cash and cash convertible investments to meet its working capital needs, the Group also ensures it has sufficient undrawn credit facilities available to complement its overall liquidity management.\n\nCompany\n\nAt 31 December 2020/2019\n\nThe currency risk exposure profile of the Company is not presented as its exposure to foreign currencies was not material at th e end of the reporting period.",

CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b)   Financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)\n\n## Liquidity risk (contd.)\n\nIn addition, the Group strives to maintain available banking facilities at a reasonable level to its overall debt position. As far as possible, the Group raises committed funding from both capital markets and financial institutions and balances its portfolio with some short term funding so as to achieve overall cost effectiveness.\n\nWhile the Group is in a net current liabilities position as at 31 December 2020, the Group has RM1,676 million in undrawn credit facilities as well as Medium Term Notes and Perpetual Sukuk programmes, which can be issued to refinance its short term borrowings according to the liquidity requirements of the Group. The Group expects to achieve further improvement in its liquidity position during the next financial year due to:\n\n- i)    positive cash flows generated from operations;\n- ii)   refinancing of certain short term borrowings with long term borrowings; and\n- iii)   cash flows from external capital funding of certain businesses of the Group.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, approximately 76% (2019: 89%) of the Group's borrowings will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amounts reflected in the financial statements.\n\nThe analysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities has been disclosed in Notes 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. For other financial assets (including investment securities, cash and bank balances and derivatives), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.\n\nThe Group's objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.\n\nThe credit risk concentration profiles have been disclosed in Notes 24 and 25 to the financial statements.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the financial instruments of the Group would fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates).\n\nThe Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from quoted investments held by the Group. These investments are held for strategic rather than trading purposes and the equity securities under other investments are classified as financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nTo manage its price risk arising from its investments, the Group diversifies its portfolio in accordance with the limits set by the Group.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of market risk has been disclosed in Note 28 to the financial statements.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 5.

REVENUE (CONTD.)\n\nDisaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers has been presented in the operating segments, Note 3 to the financial statements, which has been presented based on geographical location from which the sale transactions originated.\n\n## (a) Revenue from property development and construction contracts\n\nContracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin.\n\nRevenue from property development and construction contracts is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the agreement.\n\nRevenue is recognised as and when control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group would collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that would be transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the performance of the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\n## Revenue from property development\n\nRevenue from property development is recognised over the period of the contract using the input method by reference to the costs incurred for work performed to date against the estimated costs to completion if control of the asset transfers over time. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nSignificant judgement is required in determining the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocations and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.\n\nThe Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of contracts. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations. The Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. In estimating the total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.\n\n## Revenue from construction contracts\n\nRevenue from construction contracts is recognised over the period of the contract using the output method by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation if control of the asset transfers over time. The output method recognises revenue on the basis of direct measurements of value to the customer of the construction work performed to date relative to the remaining construction work promised under the contract.\n\nIf control of asset transfers at a point in time, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nSignificant judgement is required in estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations and determining whether there is any exposure to Liquidated Ascertained Damage ('LAD') based on the facts and circumstances of the relevant construction projects, including projects that had been served with certificates of non-achievement for project delays. In making these judgements, the Group evaluates based on experience and by relying on the work of specialists.\n\nInformation on receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers are disclosed in Notes 24 and 30 to the financial statements respectively.\n\n## (b) Sale of completed properties\n\nThe Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties, when the control of the properties has been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties have been completed and delivered to the customers and it is probable that the Group will collect the considerations to which it would be entitled to in exchange for the assets sold.\n\nThere is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of completed properties as the sales are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.\n\n## (c) Sale of goods and services, rights of enjoyment and club subscription fees\n\nRevenue from sale of products and services rendered is recognised at a point in time when the products have been transferred or the services have been rendered to the customers and coincide with the delivery of products and services and acceptance by customers.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 5.  REVENUE (CONTD.)\n\n## (c) Sale of goods and services, rights of enjoyment and club subscription fees (contd.)\n\nThere is no material right of return and warranty provided to the customers on the sale of products and services rendered.\n\nThere is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of products and services rendered as the sales or services are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.\n\nEntrance fees collected for rights of enjoyment of facilities are recognised when tickets are utilised.\n\nClub subscription fees are recognised on the accrual basis.\n\n## (d) Property management fees\n\nRevenue from property management fees are recognised over time as income when the customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\n## (e) Time sharing fees\n\nMembership fees are recognised over the membership period.\n\nAnnual maintenance fees are recognised on the accrual basis based on fees chargeable to members upon execution and renewal of the membership.\n\n## (f) Management fees\n\nManagement fees from the management of real estate investment funds activity and the provision of management services to subsidiaries are recognised over time when customers/subsidiaries simultaneously receive and consume the benefits.\n\n## (g) Interest advances and share financing\n\nInterest advances and share financing are recognised as income on accrual basis.\n\n## (h) Rental income\n\nRental income is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term of an ongoing lease.\n\n## (i) Interest on lease and hire purchase\n\nInterest on lease and hire purchase are recognised as income on the effective yield basis method.\n\n## (j) Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right of the Group to receive payment is established.",

In doing this, management considered the current environment, taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and performance of Cash Generating Units ('CGUs'). Management considered certain CGUs which are loss-making as impairment indications.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived from financial budgets approved by management.\n\nManagement has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.\n\n225",

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) (contd.)\n\nManagement has determined that the recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment are lower than their carrying amounts. Accordingly, impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of the Group amounted to RM2,745,000 (2019: RM55,916,000) has been recognised within administrative and other expenses in the statements of profit or loss during the current financial year. The pre-tax discount rates applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts range from 4.5% to 8.5% (2019: 8.5%).\n\n- (c) All items of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are initially recorded at cost. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n| Buildings                         | 2%        |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Renovations                       | 4% - 33%  |\n| Plant and machinery               | 5% - 20%  |\n| Motor vehicles                    | 10% - 20% |\n| Equipment, furniture and fittings | 5% - 33%  |\n\nFreehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.\n\nQuarry development expenditure consists of expenditure incurred to construct infrastructure to facilitate the quarry operations. Quarry development expenditure is amortised over the extractable rock reserves period, ranging from 3 to 80 years.\n\nThe useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are estimated based on common life expectancies and commercial factors applied in the various respective industries.\n\nChanges in expected level of usage, occupancy rates and economic development could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, and hence future depreciation charges on such assets could be revised.\n\n- The right-of-use assets under property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the period of the lease term. The principal depreciation periods are as follows:\n\n| Leasehold land               | over the lease period from 45 to 99 years   |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Land and buildings           | over the lease period from 1 to 10 years    |\n| Motor vehicles and equipment | over the lease period from 1 to 10 years    |\n\n- (e) During the financial year, the Group and the Company made the following cash payments to purchase property, plant and equipment:\n\n|                                                                 | Group         | Group        | Company       | Company      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                                                                 | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 |\n| Additions of property, plant and equipment                      | 466,020       | 392,233      | 668           | 87           |\n| Additions via hire purchase and lease liabilities               | (10,659)      | (10,583)     | (600)         | (43)         |\n| Movement in property, plant and equipment creditor              | 12,447        | (40,655)     | -             | -            |\n| Cash outflow for acquisition of property,   plant and equipment | 467,808       | 340,995      | 68            | 44           |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 16.

Investment properties under right-of-use assets are initially measured at costs, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the end of the reporting period and changes in fair value are included in profit or loss. Fair value gain would be adjusted after taking into consideration of the difference in recognising the rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and rental income billed to the tenant in the current financial year, where applicable.\n\nIf the Group determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably determinable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably determinable when construction is complete, the Group shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably determinable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier). Once the Group is able to measure reliably the fair value of an investment property under construction that has previously been measured at cost, the Group shall measure that property at its fair value.\n\nExternal valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets. Selection criteria of external valuers include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Management decides, after discussions with the external valuers of the Group, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case and compares changes in fair value with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. Management also verifies major inputs by agreeing information in the valuation to contracts and other relevant documents.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 17.

INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONTD.)\n\n## (e) Methods of valuation\n\n## Comparison method\n\nThe comparison/cost method of valuation entails separate valuations of the land and buildings to arrive at the market value of the subject property.\n\nUnder the comparison method, a property's fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions. This approach is based upon the principle of substitution under which a potential buyer would not pay more for the property than it would cost to buy a comparable substitute property. In theory, the best comparable sale would be an exact duplicate of the subject property and would indicate, by the known selling price of the duplicate, the price for which the subject property could be sold.\n\nThe land is valued by reference to transactions of similar lands in surrounding with adjustments made for differences in location, terrain, size and shape of the land, tenure, title restrictions, if any and other relevant characteristics.\n\nCompleted buildings are valued by reference to the current estimates on constructional costs to erect equivalent buildings, taking into consideration of similar accommodation in terms of size, construction, finishes contractors' overheads, fees and profits. Appropriate adjustments are then made for the factors of obsolescence and existing physical condition of the building.\n\nBuildings under construction are valued by reference to the total development costs incurred to date plus profits expected from its designated usage, discounted to their present value at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nAll investment properties valued using the comparison method are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Investment method\n\nA property's fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the asset's life including an exit or terminal value. As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, the investment method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the real property.\n\nThe duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment. The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of real property. In the case of investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, non-recoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses. The series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted.\n\nSignificant increases/(decreases) in estimated rental value and outgoings per annum in isolation would result in a significant higher/(lower) fair value of the properties. Significant increases/(decreases) in market yield and discount rate in isolation would result in a significantly lower/(higher) fair value.\n\nGenerally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated rental value is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the rent growth per annum and discount rate.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 18.

INVENTORIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (i) Long term leasehold land represents costs incurred as a consequence of having used the right-of-use assets to produce inventories during the financial year in accordance with MFRS 102 Inventories.\n- (ii) Land held for property development is classified within non-current assets and is stated at lower of cost and net realisable value.\n- (iii) Property development costs not recognised as an expense are recognised as an asset measured at lower of cost and net realisable value. The asset is subsequently credited over to profit or loss and recognised as an expense when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer.\n\nThe Group recognises in profit or loss the property development revenue and costs by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation at the reporting period. It is measured based on direct measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customers and the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Significant judgement is required in determining the completeness and accuracy of the budgets and the extent of the costs incurred.\n\nSubstantial changes in cost estimates can have a significant effect on the profitability of the Group in future periods. In making the above judgement, the Group relies on past experience and work of specialists. Transaction price are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations.\n\n- (iv) Completed properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost consists of cost associated with the acquisition of land, direct costs and appropriate proportions of common costs attributable for developing the properties until completion.\n- (v) Costs of trading inventories, food and beverages and consumables are determined on a weighted average basis, while cost of raw material, work in progress and finished goods is determined on a weighted average and first in, first out basis.\n- (vi) The amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the financial year are included in the cost of sales of the Group as disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\n- (vii) A write down of inventories to net realisable value and write off of inventories of RM7,811,000 (2019: RM3,417,000) and RM696,000 (2019: RM2,149,000) respectively were made during the year.\n- (viii) The Group reversed RM43,000 (2019: RM4,780,000) in respect of inventories written down in the previous financial years that were subsequently not required as the Group was able to sell those inventories above their carrying amounts.\n- (ix) Interest expense capitalised under property development costs and land held for development costs of the Group amounted to RM48,240,000 (2019: RM38,659,000) and RM49,226,000 (2019: RM65,240,000) at interest rates ranging from 3.07% to 5.90% (2019: 3.70% to 5.98%) respectively.\n\n## 19.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) Investments in subsidiaries other than investments in quoted units in wholesale funds are stated in the separate financial statements of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n- Investments in quoted units in wholesale funds are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . The fair value of quoted units in wholesale funds is categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.\n- (b) All components of non-controlling interests shall be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by MFRSs. The choice of measurement basis is made on a combination-by-combination basis. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity.\n- (c) The Company and/or its subsidiaries review the investments in subsidiaries measured at cost for impairment when there is an indication of impairment.\n- The recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are assessed by reference to the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying assets or the value-in-use of the respective subsidiaries.\n\nThe value-in-use is the net present value of the projected future cash flows derived from the business operations of the respective subsidiaries discounted at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For such discounted cash flow method, it involves the use of estimated future results and a set of assumptions to support their income and cash flows. Judgement had also been used to determine the pre-tax discount rate for the cash flows and the future growth rate of the business of the entities.\n\n- (d) The Group and the Company determined that their placements in wholesale funds are in substance, structured entities under their control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , taking into consideration their power over the wholesale funds, exposure or rights to variable returns from their involvement with the wholesale funds and their ability to use their power over the wholesale funds to affect the amount of their returns.\n\nThe Group and the Company invested in these wholesale funds with the objective of achieving short term to long term income for their treasury management purposes. The funds are managed by the respective fund managers, who apply various investment strategies to accomplish their respective investment objectives. Their operations are financed through the creation of investee fund units, which in turn entitle the holders to variable returns and fair values in the respective wholesale fund's net assets.\n\nIn relation to this, the Group and the Company hold 100% directly and indirectly in most of these wholesale funds as disclosed in Note 50 to the financial statements, which are all established in Malaysia. The Group and the Company are exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from their involvements in these funds. Accordingly, these funds are deemed as subsidiaries of the Group and of the Company and have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.\n\nDuring  the  current  financial  year,  the  Company  had  net  redemptions  of  units  in  its  wholesale  funds  amounting  to RM712,664,000 (2019: net subscriptions RM5,625,000).\n\n- (e) During the financial year, the Group completed the following subscriptions, acquisitions, disposals and redemptions of shares, incorporations and dissolutions of companies:\n- (i) On 5 February 2020, the Company had subscribed for 305,000,000 non-convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares ('RPS') in Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. ('SHSB'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for cash consideration of RM305,000,000;\n- (ii) On 9 March 2020, SHSB had disposed of 168,750 ordinary shares, representing 6.11% equity interest in Monumental Productions Sdn.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (CONTD.)\n\n- (f) The Group assessed whether there are any indications of impairment during the financial year. In doing this, management considered the current environments, taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and performance of CGUs. Management has considered the drop in market values of quoted shares in certain associates in the current financial year as impairment indications.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived from financial budgets approved by management.\n\nManagement has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.\n\nThe market values of the Group's investment in Sunway REIT, Gopeng and Elite REIT (collectively known as 'Listed Associates') are below the carrying amounts of the Group's interest in the Listed Associates as at 31 December 2020. Nevertheless, the carrying amounts are supported by the net assets of these associates as well as future cash flows to be generated by these associates. Management has determined that the recoverable amounts of these investments in associates exceed their carrying amounts and with the relatively resilient fundamentals of these associates, the Group is of the view that the carrying amounts of the investments in associates are recoverable and should not be impacted by the fluctuation of the share price of these associates, therefore no impairment loss is required at this juncture. The average pre-tax discount rates applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts range from 3.9% to 6.2%.\n\n- (g) During the financial year, the Group completed the following listing, subscription and disposal of shares/units:\n- (i) On 10 January 2020, Sunway Developments Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHSB, which in turn is a whollyowned by the Company, had disposed of 20,000,000 units, representing 21.05% equity interest in Elite REIT (formerly known as Elite UK Commercial Fund) ('Elite REIT') to Sunway RE Capital Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunCity, for cash consideration of GBP 20,000,000 (equivalent to RM109,471,000).\n- (ii) On 16 January 2020, Sunway RE Capital Pte. Ltd. had subscribed for 150,000 units representing 15% of the share capital of Elite REIT Manager for cash consideration of SGD150,000 (equivalent to RM458,000).\n- (iii) From 6 February 2020 to 2 March 2020, Sunway RE Capital Pte. Ltd.'s interest in Elite REIT had decreased following the completion of the initial public offering of Elite REIT as well as exercise of over-allotment option in full of 2,205,800 units in Elite REIT amounting to GBP1,499,944 (equivalent to RM7,915,000).\n- (iv) On 6 February 2020, Monumental Productions issued 62,500 ordinary shares. On 9 March 2020, SHSB  had disposed of 6.11% equity interest comprising 168,750 ordinary shares in Monumental Productions for cash consideration of RM250,000 as disclosed in Note 19(g) to the financial statements.\n- (v) On 6 February 2020, Elite REIT has been successfully listed on the Main Board of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.\n- (vi) On 28 October 2020, Sunway REIT Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunway City Sdn. Bhd., had subscribed 196,216,200 new units in Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust through private placement amounting to RM290,400,000.\n\n255",

GOODWILL (CONTD.)\n\n## Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations\n\nThe Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period, with a terminal value thereafter. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations for the major business segments are:\n\n|                     | Quarry   %   | Construction   %   | Property   investment   %   |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2020 |              |                    |                             |\n| Gross margin        | 12.3         | 6.4                | 42.1                        |\n| Growth rate         | 11.4         | 2.9                | 57.9                        |\n| Discount rate       | 7.2          | 6.5                | 7.2                         |\n| At 31 December 2019 |              |                    |                             |\n| Gross margin        | 9.3          | 6.2                | 47.8                        |\n| Growth rate         | 8.1          | -                  | 6.7                         |\n| Discount rate       | 8.5          | 8.5                | 8.5                         |\n\nThe following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill, including taking into consideration the effects of COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n- (i) Budgeted gross margin\n\nThe basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted gross margins is the average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year adjusted for expected efficiency improvements or deficiency.\n\n## (ii) Growth rate\n\nThe growth rate used is based on anticipated growth rates of the respective CGU obtained from financial budgets approved by management. The financial budgets cover a period of three years with no terminal growth rate thereafter.\n\n- (iii) Discount rate\n\nThe discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has adopted the Expected Cash Flow approach in performing its impairment assessment of goodwill on consolidation during the current financial year. The cash flow projections used in determining the value-in-use calculations were probability weighted based on the following scenarios:\n\n| Scenario   | Weighting   | Assumptions                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base Case  | 70%         | Based on the key assumptions above.                                                                                                         |\n| Best Case  | 10%         | Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 105% and 95% of base case  respectively for a period of three (3) years. |\n| Worst Case | 20%         | Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 95% and 105% of base case  respectively for a period of three (3) years. |",

GOODWILL (CONTD.)\n\nThe above key assumptions are determined based on management's assessment of future trends in the respective business segments,  which  are,  among  others,  dependent  on  forecasted  economic  conditions  affected  by  COVID-19  pandemic.  Any differences in expectations from the original estimates might impact the impairment losses amount in respect of the goodwill of the Group.\n\n## Sensitivity to changes in assumptions\n\nWith regard to the assessment of value-in-use of each of the major business segments, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to materially exceed their recoverable amounts, other than the change in probability weightage for the scenarios of the construction segment. The probability weightage of base case: 64%; best case: 9% and worst case: 27% would result in the value-in-use of the construction segment to be equal to its carrying amount.\n\nAX (CONTD.)\n\nDEFERRED T\n\nThe components and movements of deferred tax assets and liabilities during the financial year are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n## Deferred tax assets of the Group:\n\n## At 1 January 2019\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\nTotal\n\nRM'000\n\n## Others RM'000\n\n## Property, plant    and equipment RM'000\n\nOther\n\npayables\n\nRM'000\n\n## Provisions for liabilities RM'000\n\n## Land held for development RM'000\n\n## Unused tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances RM'000\n\n| (246,632)          | 62,328                       | (1,655)                     | (185,959)                   | (11,958)                     | (197,917)           |\n|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| (79,141)           | 55,823                       | (1)                         |                             | (12,727)                     | (36,046)            |\n|                    | 118                          | -                           |                             |                              |                     |\n| (14,172)  (1,376)  | (6,918)                      | -                           | (21,090)  (1,258)  (23,319) | 3,651   (3,913)              | (17,439)  (5,171)   |\n| (13,293)  (36,463) | (23,334)  17,890             | -   (1,654)                 | (36,627)  (20,227)          | 935   8,201                  | (35,692)  (12,026)  |\n| (102,187)          | 18,749                       | -                           | (83,438)                    |                              |                     |\n|                    |                              |                             |                             | (8,105)                      | (91,543)            |\n| At 1 January 2019  | Recognised in profit or loss | Acquisition of subsidiaries | At 31 December 2019         | Recognised in profit or loss | At 31 December 2020 |\n\nTotal\n\nRM'000\n\n## Others RM'000\n\n## Investment properties RM'000\n\n## Property, plant and equipment RM'000\n\n283,197\n\n7,921\n\n157,109\n\n118,167\n\n## Deferred tax liabilities of the Group:\n\nAt 1 January 2019\n\nAt 1 January 2019\n\n(39,366)\n\n930\n\n(41,079)\n\n783\n\nRecognised in profit or loss\n\n4,275\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4,275\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n\n1,435\n\n1,470\n\n-\n\n(35)\n\nExchange differences\n\n249,541\n\n10,321\n\n116,030\n\n123,190\n\nAt 31 December 2019\n\n12,218\n\n44\n\n(1,720)\n\n13,894\n\nRecognised in profit or loss\n\n(1,178)\n\n(29)\n\n-\n\n(1,149)\n\nLoss of control of a subsidiary\n\n167\n\n-\n\n-\n\n167\n\nAcquisition of a subsidiary\n\n69\n\n69\n\n-\n\n-\n\nExchange differences\n\n260,817\n\n10,405\n\n114,310\n\n136,102\n\nAt 31 December 2020\n\n273",

The Group's trading terms with its customers are mainly on credit. The credit period is generally for a period of 30 days to 120 days (2019: 30 days to 120 days). Each customer has a maximum credit limit. The Group seeks to maintain strict control over its outstanding receivables and has a credit control department to minimise credit risk. Overdue balances are reviewed regularly by senior management. In view of the aforementioned and the fact that the Group's trade receivables relate to a large number of diversified customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing except as stated in Note 24(k) to the financial statements.",

There are no variable lease income that are not included in the measurement of the finance lease receivables and hire purchase receivables.\n- (g) Impairment for trade receivables and contract assets are recognised based on the simplified approach using the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group considers credit loss experience and observable data such as current changes and future forecasts in economic conditions by market segment of the Group as identified in Note 3 to the financial statements to estimate the amount of expected impairment loss. The methodology and assumptions including any forecasts of future economic conditions are reviewed regularly.\n\nDuring this process, the probability of non-payment by the trade receivables is adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force participation rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic factors of the forward looking information. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such impairments are recorded in a separate impairment account with the loss being recognised within the statements of profit or loss.

These customers are internationally dispersed, engage in a wide spectrum of activities, and sell in a variety of end markets. The Group's historical experience in the collection of accounts receivable falls within the recorded allowances. Due to these factors, management believes that no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is inherent in the Group's trade receivables.\n\n- (k) At the end of the reporting period, the interest rate profile of the interest-bearing trade receivables was:\n\n|            | Group   | Group   |\n|------------|---------|---------|\n|            | 2020    | 2019    |\n|            | RM'000  | RM'000  |\n| Fixed rate | 214,063 | 267,040 |\n\nSensitivity analysis for fixed rate trade receivables at the end of the reporting period is not presented as it is not affected by changes in interest rates.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 24.

The relationship with the related party is as disclosed in Note 49 to the financial statements.\n\n- (b) Total other receivables, net of prepayments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost.\n- (c) The Group and the Company have no significant concentration of credit risk that may arise from exposures to a single debtor or to groups of debtors.\n- (d) Impairment for quasi-equity loan, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are recognised based on the general approach within MFRS 9 using the forward looking expected credit loss model. The methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment is based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for financial assets by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life with the risk of default since initial recognition. For those in which the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve month expected credit losses along with gross interest income are recognised. For those in which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised. For those that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.\n\nThe Group defined significant increase in credit risk based on operating performance of the receivables, changes to contractual terms, payment trends and past due information.\n\nThe probability of non-payment quasi-equity loan, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the twelve month or lifetime expected credit loss for the quasi-equity loan, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force participation rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic factors of the forward looking information.\n\nIt requires management to exercise significant judgement in determining the probability of default by quasi-equity loan, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, appropriate forward looking information and significant increase in credit risk, including the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 25.

During the financial year,  the Group had entered into interest rate swap to exchange floating interest rate for fixed interest rate in order to minimise the exposure from fluctuation of interest rate. This interest rate swap received floating interest rate equals to Singapore Swap Offer Rate ('SOR') per annum and paid fixed rate of interest of 1.49% and 1.58% (2019: 1.49%) per annum.\n\nThe fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are determined by using the mark to market values at the end of the reporting period and changes in the fair value is recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nInterest rate swap contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.\n\n1,240,264\n\n1,925\n\n(17,730)\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 26. DERIVATIVES (CONTD.)\n\n- (b) The Group entered into derivatives as follows: (contd.)\n- (ii) Foreign currency forward contracts\n\nThe Group entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage some of the transaction exposure. These contracts are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposure and fair value changes exposure. The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts as derivatives to hedge future changes in currency exposure of cash flows from foreign operations.\n\nForward currency contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The derivatives arising from the forward currency contracts are stated at fair value using the prevailing market rate. The fair value changes are attributable to changes in foreign exchange spot and forward rate.\n\n- (iii) Cross currency swap contracts\n\nThe Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings, which was entered into to minimise the interest cost. The Group uses cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of variability of future cash flows attributable to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations over the hedging period on the foreign currency borrowings. Where a cash flow hedge qualifies for hedge accounting, the effective portion of gains or losses on remeasuring the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised directly in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item affects profit or loss, then the gains or losses are transferred to the profit or loss. Gains or losses on any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.\n\nCross currency swap contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.\n\n- (c) The maturity profile of the Group's derivative liabilities at the end of the reporting period based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations is summarised in the table below:\n\n|                           | On demand   or within   one year   RM'000   | One to   five years   RM'000   | Over five   years   RM'000   | Total   RM'000   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|\n| Group                     |                                             |                                |                              |                  |\n| As at 31 December 2020    |                                             |                                |                              |                  |\n| Derivatives - settled net | 72,369                                      | 1,665                          | -                            | 74,034           |\n| As at 31 December 2019    |                                             |                                |                              |                  |\n| Derivatives - settled net | 17,730                                      | 187                            | -                            | 17,917           |\n\n- (d) Derivatives are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

These are strategic investments for which the Group considers this classification to be appropriate and relevant.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 28. OTHER INVESTMENTS (CONTD.)\n\n- (b) Fair value of quoted ordinary shares in Malaysia was determined by reference to the exchange quoted market prices at the close of the business on the reporting date. The fair value of quoted ordinary shares of the Group was categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n- (c) The investments in funds are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . Unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference shares and investments in funds of the Group are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference shares and investments in funds of the Group are estimated based on adjusted transacted price. The movement in other investments categorised as Level 3 during the financial year consists of additions amounted to RM61,732,000 (2019: RM4,372,000).\n- The key input to the valuation of the other investments is the adjusted transaction price paid. Significant increase/(decrease) in estimated adjusted transaction price paid in isolation would result in a significant higher/(lower) fair value of the other investments.\n- (d) The corporate memberships, unquoted corporate bonds and unquoted commercial papers are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . The fair value of corporate memberships, unquoted corporate bonds and unquoted commercial papers of the Group and of the Company is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurements of unquoted corporate bonds and unquoted commercial papers are based on indicative prices from an accredited bond pricing agency while the fair value measurements of corporate memberships are based on market prices of similar instruments.\n- (e) Sensitivity analysis of quoted ordinary shares\n\nA change of 5% in stock indices, assuming all other variables constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the fair value reserve in equity of the Group to be higher/(lower) by RM15,821,000 (2019: RM8,376,000), arising as a result of higher/lower fair value gains on quoted equity securities classified at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n- (f) There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.\n\n## 29. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS\n\nAll items of biological assets are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, biological assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation of biological assets is provided for on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each asset to its residual value over the estimated biological life, at an annual rate of 20%. Depreciation charge of biological assets recognised during the current financial year amounted to RM77,000 (2019: RM221,000).\n\nBiological assets consist of animals in petting zoos operated by subsidiaries.\n\n287",

The milestone billings are structured and/or negotiated with customers to reflect physical completion of the contracts.\n\nContract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to economic benefits become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues billing to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nThere were no significant changes in the contract assets and liabilities during the financial year.\n\n- (b) The amount of RM32,318,000 (2019: RM29,147,000) recognised in contract liabilities at the beginning of the financial year has been recognised as revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.\n- (c) Contract value yet to be recognised as revenue\n\nRevenue expected to be recognised in the future relating to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period, are as follows:\n\n|                       | Group   | Group   |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|\n|                       | 2020    | 2019    |\n|                       | RM'000  | RM'000  |\n| Within 1 year         | 378,978 | 175,003 |\n| Between 1 and 4 years | 202,083 | 218,441 |\n|                       | 581,061 | 393,444 |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 30.

BORROWINGS (CONTD.)\n\n- (d) The Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the floating rate interest payable on some of its borrowings. The contracts entitle the Group to pay interest at fixed rates on notional principal amounts and oblige it to receive interest at floating rates on the same amounts. Under the swaps, the Group agrees with the other parties to exchange, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.\n- (e) The Group also entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings as well as to minimise the interest cost.\n- (f) At the end of the reporting period, the interest rate profile of the borrowings was:\n\n|               | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|               | 2020       | 2019       | 2020       | 2019       |\n|               | RM'000     | RM'000     | RM'000     | RM'000     |\n|               | (Restated) | (Restated) | (Restated) | (Restated) |\n| Fixed rate    | 4,357,103  | 5,987,059  | 81,000     | 796,000    |\n| Variable rate | 2,553,485  | 1,908,411  | -          | -          |\n\nSensitivity analysis for fixed rate borrowings at the end of the reporting period is not presented as it is not affected by changes in interest rates.\n\nA change of 25 basis points in interest rates, assuming all other variables remained constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the profit net of tax of the Group to be lower/(higher) by RM4,852,000 (2019: RM3,626,000).\n\n- (g) The impact of cross currency swap contracts to the Group's and the Company's borrowings are as follows:\n\n|                            | Group         | Group        | Company       | Company      |\n|----------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                            | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 |\n|                            | (Restated)    | (Restated)   | (Restated)    | (Restated)   |\n| Total borrowings           | 6,910,588     | 7,895,470    | 81,000        | 796,000      |\n| Add: Cross currency swap   | 40,705        | 15,004       | -             | -            |\n| Net borrowings after cross |               |              |               |              |\n| currency swap              | 6,951,293     | 7,910,474    | 81,000        | 796,000      |\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the interest rate profile of the net borrowings after cross currency swap was:\n\n|               | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|               | 2020       | 2019       | 2020       | 2019       |\n|               | RM'000     | RM'000     | RM'000     | RM'000     |\n|               | (Restated) | (Restated) | (Restated) | (Restated) |\n| Fixed rate    | 4,397,808  | 6,002,063  | 81,000     | 796,000    |\n| Variable rate | 2,553,485  | 1,908,411  | -          | -          |\n\n297",

The variable lease payments and lease payments associated with short term leases and low value assets are recognised in profit or loss as rental expenses as disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\nVariable lease payments arising from COVID-19 related rent concessions recognised during the current financial year amounted to RM5,495,000.\n\n## Extension and termination options\n\nExtension and termination options are included in certain property leases of the Group, which are negotiated for purposes such as providing operational flexibility to the Group. The extension and termination options are mainly exercisable by the Group and not by the respective lessors.\n\nThe Group determines the lease term of a lease as the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend or to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the relevant options. Management has considered the relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to either exercise the option to extend the lease, or to exercise the option to terminate the lease. Any differences in expectations from the original estimates would impact the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities of the Group.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 38. HIRE PURCHASE AND LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTD.)\n\n## (a) (contd.)\n\nDuring the current financial year, the Group had reassessed the lease terms of certain property leases in relation to the likelihood of exercising the extension options, taking into consideration the current relevant facts and circumstances. There were also modifications on the terms and conditions of certain property leases of the Group during the current financial year.\n\nThe effects of the lease reassessments and modifications during the current financial year was a decrease in recognised lease liabilities of RM402,189,000 and right-of-use assets of RM355,813,000 as disclosed in Note 15 as well as a gain on reassessments and modifications of leases recognised in profit or loss of RM46,376,000 as disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n\n- (b) The maturity profile of the Group's and the Company's hire purchase and lease liabilities at the end of the reporting period is summarised in the table below:\n\n|                                      | Group         | Group        | Company       | Company      |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                                      | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 |\n| Less than one (1) year               | 72,227        | 113,820      | 3,054         | 3,198        |\n| One (1) to two (2) years             | 57,324        | 104,022      | 2,779         | 2,890        |\n| Two (2) to three (3) years           | 52,797        | 99,238       | 2,775         | 2,615        |\n| Three (3) to four (4) years          | 50,070        | 96,517       | 2,659         | 2,605        |\n| Four (4) to five (5) years           | 38,371        | 96,882       | -             | 2,572        |\n| More than five (5) years             | 219,688       | 643,967      | -             | -            |\n| Total undiscounted lease payments    | 490,477       | 1,154,446    | 11,267        | 13,880       |\n| Less: Future finance charges         | (114,882)     | (316,492)    | (1,262)       | (1,824)      |\n| Present value of lease liabilities   | 375,595       | 837,954      | 10,005        | 12,056       |\n| Analysis of present value of         |               |              |               |              |\n| hire purchase and lease liabilities: |               |              |               |              |\n| Less than one (1) year               | 50,333        | 69,750       | 2,764         | 2,583        |\n| One (1) to two (2) years             | 43,441        | 65,655       | 2,190         | 2,412        |\n| Two (2) to three (3) years           | 38,296        | 64,143       | 2,518         | 2,254        |\n| Three (3) to four (4) years          | 37,333        | 64,542       | 2,533         | 2,359        |\n| Four (4) to five (5) years           | 27,724        | 68,026       | -             | 2,448        |\n| More than five (5) years             | 178,468       | 505,838      | -             | -            |\n|                                      | 375,595       | 837,954      | 10,005        | 12,056       |\n| Less: Amount due within 12 months    | (50,333)      | (69,750)     | (2,764)       | (2,583)      |\n| Amount due after 12 months           | 325,262       | 768,204      | 7,241         | 9,473        |\n\n- (c) The hire purchase liabilities of the Group and of the Company attract interest at rates ranging from 2.38% to 4.70% (2019: 2.37% to 4.70%) per annum.

RESERVES (CONTD.)\n\n## (d) Cash flow hedge reserve\n\nCash flow hedge reserve represents the net gains or losses, net of tax, on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (e) Fair value reserve\n\nThe fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value through other comprehensive income investment held until the investment is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Furniture, fittings and equipment reserve\n\nIn accordance with the Hotel Master Lease Agreement, the Group must set aside in the furniture, fittings and equipment ('FF&E') reserve during each financial year, an amount equivalent to 2.5% of the anticipated revenue. The FF&E reserve must be used and disbursed only in accordance with the agreed FF&E Plan.\n\n## (g) Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the presentation currency of the Group. It is also used to record the exchange differences arising from monetary items, which form part of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations, where the monetary item is denominated in either the functional currency of the reporting entity or the foreign operation.\n\n## 45. MERGER EXERCISE\n\nOn 18 August 2011, the Company acquired the entire businesses and undertakings, including all assets and liabilities of Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. and Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (collectively known as the 'Merged Entities').\n\nThe consideration for the acquisition of the Merged Entities was satisfied via the payment of RM904.7 million cash and the issuance of 1,292.5 million new ordinary shares of RM1.00 each at an issue price of RM2.80 each together with 258.5 million free warrants.\n\nThe issuance of the new ordinary shares by the Company during the previous financial years to effect the above transaction has been reflected in the share capital of the Company as shown in Note 43 to the financial statements. As the Merged Entities were under common control before and after the merger, the Group and the Company applied the merger method of accounting. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been accounted for as if the merger had occurred from the date when these entities were under common control.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)\n\n## 46. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS\n\n## The Group as lessor\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis for operating lease payments, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                             | Group         | Group        |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                             | 2020   RM'000 | 2019  RM'000 |\n| Less than one (1) year      | 57,233        | 54,911       |\n| One (1) to two (2) years    | 57,688        | 53,244       |\n| Two (2) to three (3) years  | 54,922        | 54,801       |\n| Three (3) to four (4) years | 55,713        | 54,123       |\n| Four (4) to five (5) years  | 55,347        | 55,204       |\n| More than five (5) years    | 115,440       | 119,883      |\n|                             | 396,343       | 392,166      |\n\nThe Group entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements on properties with third parties. The commercial properties combined leases of land and buildings. At the inception of the lease, it was not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between the land and the buildings. Therefore, the Group evaluated based on terms and conditions of the arrangement, whether the land and the buildings were clearly operating leases or finance leases.\n\n## 47.

The Group recognises these insurance contracts as recognised insurance liabilities when there is a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits would be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether its recognised insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance contracts. If this assessment shows that the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities is inadequate, the entire deficiency shall be recognised in profit or loss.\n\nRecognised insurance liabilities are only removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished via a discharge, cancellation or expiration.\n\nThe determination of treatment of contingent liabilities is based on management's view of the expected outcome of the contingencies for matters in the ordinary course of the business.\n\nThe Directors are of the view that the chances of the third parties and financial institutions to call upon the guarantees are remote.\n\n## (b) Material outstanding litigations\n\n- (i) On 4 September 2008, the solicitors of Sunway Construction Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCon') had been served with a Statement of Claim ('Statement of Claim') by Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd ('Claimant').\n\nPursuant to an agreement signed between SunCon and the National Highway Authority of India for the rehabilitation and upgrading of NH-25 to a four-lane configuration in the state of Uttar Pradesh being a part of the East-West Corridor Project, SunCon had entered into a work order with the Claimant for the upgrading and rehabilitation of the stretch of NH-25 from 143.6 km to 170.0 km, of which the Claimant has provided two bank guarantees ('Bank Guarantees') to SunCon.\n\nThe Claimant has failed to carry out its obligations under the work order and SunCon has terminated the work order and cashed the Bank Guarantees. The Claimant had filed an application in the Supreme Court of India for the appointment of an arbitrator to arbitrate upon the disputes between the parties. The Supreme Court had appointed a sole arbitrator.\n\nThe Statement of Claim was raised in respect of various claims and the total amount claimed is Rs.891.5 million (approximately equivalent to RM49.1 million) in addition to interest and cost.\n\nIn the counterclaim, SunCon is seeking for Rs.781.4 million (approximately equivalent to RM43.1 million) for inter alia, additional costs incurred by SunCon to complete the works, recovery of mobilisation advance and interest charges, loss of reputation and loss of profits.",

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) Material outstanding litigations (contd.)\n\n- (i) (contd.)\n\nOn 11 January 2013, the arbitrator that presided over the case passed away and 75 hearings had been held.\n\nSunCon was notified by its solicitors that an arbitration petition had been filed by the Claimant on 7 January 2016 in the Supreme Court of India for the appointment of a new arbitrator. The Supreme Court of India by an order dated 5 January 2017 appointed Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen (a former Judge of the Supreme Court of India) as arbitrator. The first hearing before Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen was held on 24 February 2017 and cross examination had been completed on 7 October 2017.\n\nThe Arbitrator published his award on 9 April 2019 and awarded the Claimant Rs.128.4 million (approximately equivalent to RM7.1 million).\n\nSunCon had filed an appeal with the High Court of New Delhi in early July 2019 to set aside the arbitral award. Claimant has also filed an execution application against SunCon for enforcement of the arbitral award.\n\nOn 10 February 2020,  the  Honourable Court  has  directed  SunCon to deposit, on a without prejudice basis, the decretal amount with interest with the Registrar General of the High Court of Delhi. SunCon has deposited Rs.135.7 million (approximately equivalent to RM7.5 million) on 26 February 2020 and the amount has been fully provided in the accounts on prudence grounds. Subject to compliance of the said direction, the Honourable Court has stayed the Arbitral Award dated 9 April 2019. The matter has now been fixed for hearing on 2 June 2021.\n\nThe Claimant filed an application in the High Court of Delhi to permit the Claimant to withdraw the decretal amount deposited by SunCon on 4 March 2020 for release of Rs.67.3 million (approximately equivalent to RM3.7 million) from the deposited Award Amount.\n\nOn 27 August 2020, the Court directed the release of Rs.67.2 million (approximately equivalent to RM3.7 million) on the basis of a corporate guarantee to the furnished by Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. ('SIFL'). The balance is to be released subject to furnishing of a bank guarantee. On 3 November 2020, the court placed on record the corporate guarantee issued on 21 September 2020 and directed the registry to release the amount in terms of the Court order dated 27 August 2020. On 18 November 2020, Claimant withdrew their application for withdrawal without a bank guarantee and it has been dismissed accordingly.\n\n- (ii) PNSB Acmar Sdn. Bhd. ('Plaintiff') had on 14 November 2019 served a Writ of Summon and a Statement of Claim both dated 8 November 2019 on Prasarana Malaysia Berhad ('Prasarana') (1st Defendant) and Sunway Construction Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCon') (2nd Defendant).\n\nThe Plaintiff is claiming that all the construction works in relation to the project known as 'Construction and Completion of Light Rail Transit Line 3 (LRT3) from Bandar Utama to Johan Setia' ('Project') and the structures such as the Project's poles, bars, and LRT stations had trespassed and/or encroached into the Plaintiff's own development project area and has resulted in losses and damages towards the Plaintiff.\n\nPrasarana is the owner of the Project and SunCon is the awarded Works Package Contractor for the contract known as 'Contract No. Prasarana/GSC/CTT/2.06080/ 2017: Construction and Completion of Guideway, Stations Iconic Bridge, Park and Rides, Ancillary Buildings and other Associated Works for Package GS07-08 for Light Rail Transit 3 (LRT3) from Bandar Utama to Johan Setia' in relation to the Project.\n\nThe Plaintiff is claiming, amongst other, for the following:\n\n- (a) Special damages of RM711,367,434.46;\n- (b) The costs between the solicitor and client amounts to RM400,000.00;\n- (c) Interest rate of 5% per year from the date of trespass i.e. 30 April 2018 until the full settlement; and\n- (d) Court's declarations, injunctions, orders and other reliefs that the Honourable Court deems fit and proper.\n\nOn the case management on 5 March 2020, the Court had directed SunCon to file the application to strike out the case by 19 March 2020. On 30 October 2020, the striking out application by Prasarana and SunCon is dismissed and matter is to proceed for full trial. On 9 December 2020, the Plaintiff filed an application for discovery against the Defendants. The matter was initially fixed for hearing on 23 April 2021. Subsequently, the Court has fixed the decision for the Plaintiff's application for discovery on 10 May 2021 and is awaiting for final decision.

Bhd.\n- (x) Sunway Senior Living Sdn. Bhd.\n\n## (g) The Coronavirus disease 'COVID-19' pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an adverse impact to the performance of the global economy, including Malaysia. In relation to this, the Government of Malaysia had implemented the Movement Control Order ('MCO'), which took effect from 18 March 2020. During the MCO period, all government and private premises except those involved in providing essential services were required to be closed and to cease operations during the MCO period unless exempted. The MCO was subsequently followed by the enforcement of Conditional MCO and then, Recovery MCO.\n\nOn 11 January 2021, the Government of Malaysia had re-introduced the MCO and Conditional MCO in several states in Malaysia from 13 January 2021 until 7 June 2021.\n\nUpon the implementation of the initial MCO, the Group had to temporarily suspend most of its operations (except for those operations involved in providing essential services), which include the closure of the Group's property sales galleries, suspension of its on-going development projects, closures of the retail properties, hospitality and leisure operations as well as suspension of its construction operations. Nevertheless, the majority of the Group's business operations has since resumed operations during the CMCO and RMCO periods while adhering to the standard operating procedures and directives issued by the Government of Malaysia throughout the period. The Group has also activated its Business Continuity Plan and implemented various procedures in its business conduct to reduce the risks of spread and safeguard its employees and customers.\n\nThe financial impact to the Group during the initial MCO period mainly arose from its diminished sources of income as most of its business operations were suspended whilst the fixed overhead costs that include salary, security personnel expenses, and rental expense continued to be incurred.\n\n## (g) The Coronavirus disease 'COVID-19' pandemic (contd.)\n\nWhile most of the business operations of the Group are gradually recovering from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic during the CMCO and RMCO periods in 2020, the hospitality and leisure operations of the Group under the Property Investment segment continued to be impacted in the first quarter of financial year 2021 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the reinstatement of the CMCO and MCO, which called for the closure of the theme park operations and more stringent social distancing requirements.\n\nThe Group has therefore considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across its business operations continuously and took the necessary precautions and provisions where necessary. The Group will also continue to actively monitor and manage its funds and operations to minimise any further impact arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on the assessment of the Group, the judgements and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 have not been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic other than as disclosed in Notes 15, 22, 24, 25 and 30 to the financial statements.\n\n## 53. ADOPTION OF MFRSS AND AMENDMENTS TO MFRSS\n\n## (a) New MFRSs adopted during the financial year\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:\n\nDuring the financial year, the Group and the Company adopted the following Standards that are mandatory for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020.\n\n| Title                                                                  | Effective Date   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in MFRS Standards | 1 January 2020   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 3  Definition of a Business                         | 1 January 2020   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS 108  Definition of Material            | 1 January 2020   |\n| Amendment to MFRS 16  Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions                | 1 June 2020 *    |\n| Amendments to MFRS 4  Insurance Contract - Extension of the Temporary  | 17 August 2020 ^ |\n| Exemption from Applying MFRS 9                                         |                  |\n\n- * Early adopted by the Group and the Company.\n- ^ Effective immediately.\n\nAdoption of the above Standards did not have any material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group and of the Company except for the adoption of Amendment to MFRS 16 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions as described in the following sections.\n\n## Amendment to MFRS 16 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\nThe Group and the Company have early adopted Amendment to MFRS 16 and elected to apply the practical expedient to all rent concessions relating to leases with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. Consequently, the Group and the Company do not recognise changes in these lease payments as lease modifications and instead, recognise these as variable lease payments in profit or loss. The effects of early adoption are disclosed in Note 38 to the financial statements.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 (CONTD.)",

FINANCIAL REPORTING UPDATES\n\n## (a) IFRIC Agenda Decision Over time transfer of constructed good (IAS 23)\n\nThe IFRS Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') received a submission about the capitalisation of borrowing costs in relation to the construction of a residential multi-unit real estate development.\n\nBased on the fact pattern described in the submission, the request asked whether the entity has a qualifying asset as defined in IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and, therefore, capitalises any directly attributable costs.\n\nThe IFRIC concluded in March 2019 that, in the fact pattern described in the request:\n\n- (i) Any receivable and contract asset that the entity recognises is not a qualifying asset.\n- (ii) Any inventory (work-in-progress) for unsold units under construction that the entity recognises is also not a qualifying asset because the unsold units are ready for its intended use or sale.\n\nThe MASB announced on 20 March 2019 that an entity shall apply the change in accounting policy as a result of this Agenda Decision to financial statements of annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020.\n\nThe Group is in the process of assessing the impact of implementing this change in accounting policy.

This has also resulted in the reclassification of distributions to holders of perpetual sukuk from transactions with owners recognised directly in equity in the statements of changes in equity to profit or loss.\n\n## LIST OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES\n\n## AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020\n\n| LOCATION / ADDRESS                                                                                       | LAND AREA  (ACRES) /  BUILT UP  AREA (SQ FT)   | DESCRIPTION /   EXISTING USE                                           | AGE OF  BUILDING  (YEARS)   | TENURE                                          | NET BOOK  VALUE AS AT  31.12.2020  (RM'000)   | DATE OF ACQUISITION  (A) / REVALUATION  (R) / CONSTRUCTION  (C)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PT 252 HS(D) 63419 PT 4974 HS(D) 79345 PN 92838 Lot 72241 PT 194 HS(D) 238244 PT 193 HS(D) 238243        | 21.83                                          | Kelana Jaya land (Land under  development and   held for  development) | -

Ordinary Resolution 9 - To re-appoint Messrs BDO PLT as Auditors of the Company for the ensuing year and to authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration\n\nBased on the results of the External Auditors Evaluation for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Board had at its meeting on 17 May 2021, approved the re-appointment of Messrs BDO PLT (' BDO ') as Auditors of the Company on the basis that BDO had satisfactorily performed their audit and that BDO had discharged their professional responsibilities in accordance with the rules on professional conduct and ethics of BDO and the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conducts and Practice) issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.\n\n## (ii) Special Business\n\n## 5. Ordinary Resolution 10 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Companies Act 2016\n\nThe Company is always on the look out for investment opportunities to enhance the earnings potential of the Company. If any investment opportunities involve the issue of new shares, the Directors, under present circumstances, would have to convene a general meeting to approve the issue of new shares even though the number involved may be less than 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company.\n\nIn order to avoid any delay and costs involved in convening a general meeting to approve such issue of shares, it is thus considered appropriate that the Directors be empowered to issue new shares in the Company, up to an amount not exceeding in total 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company at any time, for such purpose. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the next AGM of the Company.\n\nThe renewal of this mandate will provide flexibility to the Company for any potential fund raising activities, including but not limited to placement of shares, for purpose of funding current and/or future investments, working capital, acquisition, repayment of borrowings, operational expenditure and/ or such other applications they may in their absolute discretion deem fit.\n\nAt this juncture, there is no decision to issue new shares under this general mandate. Should there be a decision to issue new shares after the authorisation is sought, the Company will make an announcement of the actual purpose and utilisation of proceeds arising from such issuance of shares.\n\nThe Company did not issue any new shares under the general mandate which was approved at its Tenth Annual General Meeting held on 2 September 2020.\n\n- 6. Ordinary Resolution 11 - Proposed Renewal of Existing Shareholders' Mandate and Proposed New Shareholders' Mandate for Recurrent Related Party Transactions of a Revenue or Trading Nature\n\nThe details on the proposed renewal of existing shareholders' mandate and proposed new shareholders' mandate for recurrent related party transactions of a revenue or trading nature are set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 27 May 2021.\n\n- 7.
