This report is intended as the cornerstone of the Group's annual public reporting.\n\nThis Management Report faithfully presents the Repsol Group's business, results and financial position, together with a description of the main risks and uncertainties it faces, and the approach set out in the Strategic Plan. It also provides information on Sustainability, including the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas. The report not only complies with applicable legal requirements2 but is aligned with best practice and, in particular, with the recommendations of the 'International Integrated Reporting Framework' of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), the 'Gu\u00eda para la Elaboraci\u00f3n del Informe de Gesti\u00f3n de las Entidades Cotizadas' of the CNMV, Spain's securities market regulator, and the European Commission Guidelines on non-financial reporting (methodology for reporting non-financial information) (2017/C 215/01).\n\nThe financial information included in this document, unless expressly indicated otherwise, has been prepared in accordance with the Group's reporting model described in Note 4 'Business information'3 of the 2020 consolidated financial statements. Some of the financial indicators and ratios are considered Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) in accordance with the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) Guidelines4.\n\nThe report must be read together with the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been filed along with this Report with the CNMV (www.cnmv.es) and are also available at www.repsol.com. The information relating to the Sustainability indicators is presented in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 5 using the \"comprehensive' option. Appendix IV \"GRI Index\" contains a list of the Sustainability indicators included throughout the report, in other public reports released by the Company, or reported in Appendix III \"Additional Sustainability Information.\" These indicators, together with the additional information required by Law 11/2018, comprise the Statement of Non-Financial Information, the content of which is set out in Appendix V 'Statement of Non-Financial Information'. Sustainability figures and indicators have been calculated according to corporate rules that specify the criteria and common methodology to be applied to labor, environment, human rights and social issues that is described in detail in each of its sections. This information is verified by an external auditor (PwC), according to ISAE 3000 (Verification report available at www.repsol.com ). Additionally, in 2020 the Report voluntarily includes indicators according to the  SASB 'Sustainability Accounting Standards Board' (Appendix VI). Lastly, the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact have been taken into account in drawing up this information. The forward-looking information contained in this document reflects the plans, forecasts or estimates of the Group's management at the date of their authorization for issue. Such forward-looking information is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable, and cannot be considered as a guarantee of the entity's future performance, in the sense that such plans, forecasts or estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties, meaning that the future performance of the Group will not necessarily coincide with what  was initially planned.\n\nRepsol's mission (its reason for being) is to provide energy to society efficiently and sustainably. Our vision (where Repsol is heading) is to be a global energy company that relies on innovation, efficiency and respect to create sustainable value in the service of societal progress.\n\nRepsol has laid down principles of action -' Efficiency, Respect, Foresight and Value Creation '- and a set of Company behaviors -' Results-Oriented, Accountability, Cooperation, Entrepreneurial Attitude  and Inspiring Leadership '- to make our mission a reality and our vision an attainable challenge.\n\nFurther information available at www.repsol.com\n\n- 2.

It has also given rise to a significant increase in unemployment. Given the sense of despondency that seems to have taken hold in society, I would like to convey a message of cautious optimism and assure you that our country has the resources and assets needed to embark on the recovery and build a more resilient economy.\n\nSpain must base its recovery on the main strengths of its economy, which include industry. This is one of the country's most valuable strategic assets, as shown during the lockdown, when companies such as Repsol guaranteed the supply of basic energy products and services for mobility and households. I would like to thank all the employees at our industrial complexes, LPG plants, and service stations, who, like so many others, continued to work on-site during these testing months and helped the company fulfil an essential public service.\n\nThe hard work carried out during this period has shown once again that industry is part of the backbone of the Spanish economy and is one of its main driving forces. In our country, 80% of private research and innovation is related to industry, which dedicates 2.1% of its Gross Value",

Industry also generates quality employment, with 95% of contracts being full-time, 81% permanent and salaries between 20% and 25% higher than in the services sector. The refining business alone generates 40 billion euros a year in turnover, while generating 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in Spain.\n\nYet despite these figures, the reality is that both Europe and Spain have been losing industrial capacity for some time. Spanish industrial GDP is 16% and the European average is 19%, compared to 20% and 21% respectively in 1996. As a society, the decline of industry has undoubtedly made us more vulnerable, as seen at the beginning of the pandemic when European countries encountered serious difficulties in supplying health equipment.\n\nTherefore, one of the conclusions we can draw from what has happened so far during this pandemic is that we need to increase the weight of the industrial sector within the wider economy by promoting sectors with more technology and higher added value, as indeed the European Union has been urging its Member States to do for years. This will allow us to create a more resilient economy, as we follow the likes of Germany, Finland, or Norway, where industry accounts for over 20% of GDP and where citizens enjoy high levels of welfare and have coped better with recent crises.\n\nTo move closer to these countries, Spain needs a broad national pact to promote its industry, involving public administrations, companies, and social agents alike. This will ultimately allow us to strengthen the sector and allow it to compete with the most advanced economies when it comes to state-of-the-art technology and innovation. We need to provide the country with a long-term strategy, one that lays the foundations for a more industrialized economy, with concrete measures to boost investment in R&D from the current level of 1.25% to over 2% of GDPthe EU average-and to strengthen vocational training by focusing on the skills most needed in this new era.\n\nI am convinced that the Next Generation program of the European Union will be a unique opportunity to champion the reindustrialization of our country. The 72 billion euros that Spain will receive over the coming three years must be used to strengthen the productive fabric and modernize the economy by investing in those sectors that can contribute the most to improving our competitiveness, such as the ecological transition, digitalization and, evidently, industry. It is also essential that these investments are undertaken through close cooperation between public administrations and private companies, to ensure that the resources are used efficiently and that the country gets the most out of them.\n\nSpain needs a broad national pact to promote its industry, which will allow us to strengthen the sector and make it compete at the cutting edge of technology\n\nPublic-private partnerships will not only be needed to manage these funds. Spanish industry needs the government's support to continue generating wealth, with fiscal policies that recognize and reward the efforts of companies that invest in creating jobs and innovation; environmental policies that do not undermine our industrial competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis industries in countries that are less demanding in this area; and suitable regulatory frameworks to eliminate the uncertainty that serves only to hinder investment decisions by companies.\n\nWe must therefore get on the same page and work together to strengthen our industry. If we succeed, this sector will become one of the main drivers of the economic recovery and job creation, while continuing to play a prominent role in the energy transition, another of the great challenges we face as a society.\n\n## Industry, a key element in the energy transition\n\nThe industrial sector, to which Repsol belongs, has much to say in the energy transition, which is a global challenge involving all governments, companies, and citizens. Thanks to its ability to promote research and innovation, industry will be key to developing the technologies needed to meet the European Union's emissions reduction target, which a few months ago was raised from 40% to 55% by 2030.\n\nFor years, the refining sector has been leading European industry's efforts to make its activities more sustainable by plotting out various technological routes to reduce its CO2 emissions across processes and products. I would like to emphasize the contribution made by Repsol here. Through efficiency measures, it has reduced the energy consumption of its refineries by 20% in 10 years and, as a company, it has succeeded in reducing its CO2 emissions by 5.5 million metric tons per year between 2006 and 2020.\n\nRight now, the refining sector is undergoing a technological revolution in the truest sense. We have embarked upon a transformation process that will allow us to turn our refineries into multi-energy hubs that in the short run will be able to process alternative raw materials to generate fuels and materials with a low carbon footprints. To give an example, technology will allow us to produce advanced biofuels from urban, agricultural, forestry, or agri-food industry waste. Moreover, the renewable hydrogen and CO2 captured at the refineries themselves can be used to make synthetic biofuels. Both these low-carbon products will play a key role in our mobility in the future.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThis industrial transformation is one of the pillars of our 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, with which we will make progress towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Our most outstanding projects in this area include the construction in Cartagena of Spain's first advanced biofuels plant and the construction of both a synthetic fuels plant and a biogas plant in Bilbao. Also in Bilbao, we plan to build Europe's first 100 megawatt (MW) alkaline electrolysis plant, signaling a big technological leap forward when it comes to the production of renewable hydrogen. The company will rely on these cutting-edge industrial initiatives to help develop a strong and sustainable industry that will boost the reactivation of the economy and create job opportunities in key sectors for the future, such as digitalization and technology.\n\nAll these projects are further proof of Repsol's commitment to leading the decarbonization of the economy, even amid the current crisis. Apart from the industrial transformation, another of the main levers of our strategy is to improve the energy efficiency of our traditional businesses, notably refining. I would also like to highlight the progress made in this direction by our hydrocarbon exploration and production (Upstream) business. In recent decades it has been fundamental in making Repsol a truly global operator and a benchmark within the sector, thanks to our technological capacities.\n\nThis activity will remain a strategic concern for Repsol over the coming years. Despite the foreseeable changes in the energy model, oil will remain a useful and necessary energy source in a decarbonized world where it will be put to uses that do not emit CO2, such as the production of fiber, insulating materials, fertilizer, rubber, and even tires and plastics for car interiors. The same holds true for natural gas which is needed to replace coal in power generation and is key to boosting the development of renewable energy, as it can take over when their production dips.\n\nThe challenge will be to continue producing the oil and gas that society needs in an increasingly sustainable way. At Repsol we are prepared to face this challenge thanks to our sound portfolio management, efficiency, and technological prowess. All this will allow us to cut the CO2 emissions of this business by 75% during the period 2021-2025, while also ensuring its profitability which will help us to continue advancing along the path to decarbonization.\n\nAside from improving the efficiency of these traditional businesses, we have added a number of low-carbon businesses to our portfolio, with six renewable projects now under development in Spain (three wind and three photovoltaic) and a joint venture in Chile. We have also built a new customer-centric business from which we will prioritize the supply of low-emission energy to consumers in the Iberian Peninsula and the development of products and digital tools to facilitate energy management and make homes more energy efficient.\n\nWe need an adequate regulatory framework, one that contemplates and champions the development of all existing decarbonization technologies and energies\n\n## Committed to a hybrid energy model\n\nAt Repsol we are committed to using all available technological options to achieve our decarbonization objectives. We advocate a hybrid energy model that combines electrification with the use of low-carbon fuels, such as advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, and renewable hydrogen. All of them will be crucial over the coming years in decarbonizing sectors that are difficult to electrify in the mid-term with today's technology, such as long-distance road transport and the maritime and aviation industries.\n\nLooking at the situation in these sectors, it is plain to see that electricity cannot be the solution for everything. Therefore, mature technologies that are already managing to reduce their carbon footprint, such as increasingly efficient internal combustion engines, can and indeed should coexist with new electric and renewable technologies. I am convinced that the combination of different technologies and forms of energy is the best formula for accomplishing our objective of decarbonizing society in the shortest possible time and, above all, at the lowest cost to citizens.\n\nThere is, therefore, no single solution to reduce CO2 emissions. It is essential that our authorities always apply the principle of technology neutrality when legislating and making decisions, as envisioned in the European Green Deal and the future European Climate Law. I firmly believe that it is essential to allow the different technologies and types of energy available to us to compete freely as we go about decarbonizing the economy, with no bans or exclusions, since right now we are unable to predict which of them will be the most efficient in the mid to long term.\n\nRepsol has concrete plans in place to accelerate the decarbonization of its processes, produce fuels and materials with a low carbon footprint, and incorporate new low-emissions businesses, all with the support of technology and innovation. To succeed, we need an adequate regulatory framework - one that contemplates and champions the development of all existing decarbonization technologies and types of energy. This is the only way to make effective progress toward the energy transition and successfully complete the transformation of our sector which has several industrial projects in progress that can drive the economic recovery and, let us not forget, supply society with energy products that are essential for its well-being.\n\nI am convinced that our sector will emerge stronger from this crisis and will be able to continue supporting the growth of the Spanish economy. Thank you all for your trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAntonio Brufau Niub\u00f3 Chairman",

It has been a tremendously difficult year for everyone. COVID-19 has taken the lives of thousands of people and brought economic activity to a screeching halt, with negative growth figures not seen since last century.\n\nIn our sector, the pandemic triggered a dramatic decline in oil and gas prices and a collapse of demand. In 2020, the average Brent crude oil price fell by around 34% to average 41.8 $/bbl. Meanwhile, Henry Hub gas saw its average price fall by some 19%, averaging 2.1 $/MBtu over the period. To compound matters further, we witnessed an inevitable decline in fuel sales due to the mobility restrictions put in place to combat the virus. At our service stations in Spain, we experienced an average decline of 23% for the full year, though peaking at an 85% reduction during the strictest lockdown periods.\n\nIn this extremely difficult environment, at Repsol we have once again demonstrated the strength of our business. Firstly, we have continued to fulfill an essential public service, proving once again that we are a company with immense social value and worth. Our priority at all times was to keep our facilities operational. Repsol employees continued to work even at the height of the pandemic, with appropriate safety",

To achieve this feat, we have relied on digitalization and the new ways of working that we have been promoting for years. They have proven their worth during this crisis and kept the company operating daily. I would like to thank every one of you once again for your efforts.\n\nIn a year when the pandemic has accentuated inequalities around the world, I am proud that our company has been able to ensure the supply of energy products and services to society as a whole, while protecting jobs and continuing to look after the communities in which we operate. I think this is the finest example of our unwavering commitment to ensuring respect for human rights and of how we are integrating into our business the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact that we adhered to in 2002 in a bid to promote sustainable development.\n\n## A Resilience Plan to strengthen our balance sheet\n\nThe hostile global landscape arisen from the pandemic prompted us to take steps to ensure the company's sustainability. We reviewed our assumptions of future oil and gas prices as a show of financial prudence, thus lowering the value of our Upstream assets. Meanwhile, in March we launched a Resilience Plan across all of our businesses, with specific measures to improve cash generation and strengthen our balance sheet.\n\nBy December 31, we had accomplished greater savings than expected in operating expenses and cuts in investment. This has allowed us to reduce our net debt by 1.178 billion euros compared with the previous year, bringing it to 3.042 billion euros, even though the scenario has been worse than considered in March 2020 when we launched the Resilience Plan.\n\nThe effectiveness of the measures rolled out under this plan can also be seen in our accounts. In 2020, we were able to deliver positive operating cash flow of 3.197 billion euros, and an adjusted net income - which measures the performance of our businesses -  of 600 million euros. This, once again, shows our strength even in this complex scenario of depressed commodity prices and unusually low demand.\n\nAt Repsol we are not only showing resilience in coping with this unprecedented scenario. We are also laying the foundations for the company's future. In this decade, we want to consolidate our position as a sustainable multi-energy company with a global presence; a company that will ultimately help achieve a more decarbonized world by relying on\n\nAmid this hostile environment, we have continued to fulfill an essential  public service, proving once again that we are a company with immense social value and worth\n\nall available technologies, as all forms of energy will be necessary for a just and efficient energy transition, at the lowest possible cost for citizens.\n\nThe backbone of this transformation process is our 2021-2025 Strategic Plan which we approved in November last year. It aims to accelerate the company's energy transition and signals a clear commitment to the decarbonization of our asset portfolio. This plan plots out a realistic and profitable roadmap for the coming years that will allow us to continue to grow, ensure profitability, and generate maximum value for our shareholders.\n\nOne of the objectives of this Strategic Plan is to maintain one of the most attractive remuneration policies in the industry and among all Ibex 35 companies, combining cash payments with share buybacks. Thus, our dividend will be \u20ac0.60/share (scrip dividend plus cash dividend) in 2021. This will be steadily increased over the course of duration of the plan to reach \u20ac0.75/share. By 2025, the shareholder remuneration will exceed \u20ac1/share, including cash payment and share buybacks to be carried out from 2022 onwards.\n\n## Ambitious emissions reduction targets\n\nThe main purpose of the new Strategic Plan is to help us become a net-zero emissions company by 2050, in line with the targets envisioned in the Paris Agreement on climate change. The recent decision of the United States to rejoin the agreement is a major boost that will hopefully make international relations and the global economic situation more stable, as both these factors heavily impact the activities of a global company like Repsol.\n\nTo achieve zero net emissions by 2050, our company has outlined a demanding roadmap, including new and more ambitious emissions reduction targets, with a reduction in carbon intensity of 12% by 2025, 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2040. In energy efficiency alone, for instance, we will invest 400 million euros over the next five years to reduce 800,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. These figures confirm Repsol's status as an energy company committed to a more sustainable world. Not only does it seek to reduce its carbon footprint, it also applies mechanisms to protect the environment when planning and undertaking all of its projects and operations.\n\nTo achieve our emissions reduction targets we will champion an energy model that integrates various technological options, combining electrification with the use of products that have a low, neutral, or even negative carbon footprint. We will also continue to focus on reducing energy consumption, as well as digitalizing our operations through artificial intelligence, automation, and cloud-based solutions.\n\nOne of the core features of the Strategic Plan is the implementation of a new operating model which will enhance the strengths of our",

It will also promote the development and growth of new zero-emission businesses centered on the customer and renewable power generation, two of the main pillars of the company's growth in the coming years.\n\nIn our new Low-Emissions Generation business, the aim is to continue growing our portfolio of projects in operation in Spain - currently standing at 3.3 gigawatts (GW)-  and to develop new assets in international markets on the path to becoming a global operator, with a generation capacity of 7.5 GW by 2025 and 15 GW by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, our new Customer Unit will be tasked with meeting the energy and mobility needs of our 24 million customers. We want to harness our competitive advantages to lead the multi-energy supply to consumers in the Iberian Peninsula, by offering them a differential global service that features a steadily growing weight of low-emissions energy and digital products and tools.\n\nThe circular economy is another pillar of our new strategy and a key lever for the delivery on our commitment to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. It will enable us to transform our industrial complexes into multi-energy hubs, capable of using all types of waste as raw materials to generate products with a low, zero, or even negative carbon footprint. Thanks to this transformation, Repsol will become a benchmark in sustainable biofuels, with a production capacity of 1.3 million metric tons by 2025, as well as in the production of renewable hydrogen, with a capacity equivalent to 400 MW by 2025.\n\nLast year, we already took the first steps in this direction, with the launch of several state-of-the-art industrial projects. These include Spain's first advanced biofuels plant, which we will build in Cartagena, and two major decarbonization initiatives we plan to carry out in Bilbao: one of the world's largest net-zero emission synthetic fuel production plants and a facility capable of generating gas from municipal waste.\n\nLast but not least, our upstream business will focus on the development of short-cycle projects that can be managed flexibly and with limited capex intensity, thus increasing their contribution to the company's results and generating positive cash flow. The aim is to bring average production to 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and to reduce our global presence to 14 countries, with a more efficient and focused exploration activity.\n\nWe will invest a total of 18.3 billion euros over the whole period of the plan. We intend to invest 42% - some 7.7 billion euros-  in Spain as a clear illustration of our commitment to making Spanish industry more competitive, helping its decarbonization and promoting industrial employment.\n\nTo cope with the current environment, we rely not only on the strength of our industrial assets and our financial health, but above all on the immense talent of our human team\n\n## A strong project for the future\n\nRepsol is a strong and resilient company. In previous downcycles, it has amply demonstrated its ability to emerge stronger from adverse circumstances, such as the one we have unfortunately all been witnessing in recent months. To cope with the current situation, we rely not only on the strength of our industrial assets and our financial health, but, above all, on the immense talent of our diverse human team, made up of people of 79 nationalities and with extensive experience in the efficient management of energy resources and technological innovation. I am convinced that we have the best possible team to step up the essential decarbonization process at our company and to undertake the progressive incorporation of new low-emission businesses.\n\nAnd, of course, to help us get through the economic slowdown, we have our 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, a solid foundation on which to build a company of the future and to continue advancing toward our goal of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. At Repsol we view decarbonization as an opportunity to develop more profitable businesses and to continue growing and to become, in this decade, the multi-energy company that society is calling for to cover all of its needs in a sustainable way.\n\nI thank you all for the trust you have placed in our project, particularly in these very difficult times. Let us now continue our journey together. Thank you.\n\nJosu Jon Imaz San Miguel Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

This severe crisis shaped an extraordinarily complex and demanding landscape for Repsol's businesses, affected by the drop in general economic activity and, especially, by lockdown restrictions introduced to fight the pandemic.\n\nAgainst this difficult backdrop, and even at the most critical junctures, Repsol was able to keep it businesses running, most of which are considered essential or strategic activities, thus guaranteeing the supply of energy products and services that are essential for society and safeguarding the health and safety of its employees, customers and suppliers.\n\nThe crisis significantly reduced the demand for oil, gas and derivative products and sparked a dramatic fall in their prices, with a heavy impact on the profitability of our businesses. However, the 2020 Resilience Plan draw up by the Company to protect cash flow generation and ensure a strong balance sheet amid the crisis - through ambitious targets in terms of cost efficiencies and investment-  enabled the generation of positive free cash flow, cut net debt and maintained our investment grade credit rating throughout 2020.\n\nIn any case, it should be noted that in the latter part of the year, given fresh optimism of an exit from the crisis, we saw a recovery in demand and prices for our products, which has certainly pushed up the profitability of our businesses, especially at E&P, Chemicals and Commercial.\n\nFor more information, see Sections 2. COVID-19: Impacts and Resilience Plan and 5. Environment.\n\nIn this extremely challenging environment, Repsol has focused on its role as a supplier of essential products and services to society.\n\nFlexibility of the businesses in generating cash during the crisis.\n\n## New Strategic Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Growth and value in the energy transition\n- \u00b7 New operating model acting as a catalyst of value and decarbonization\n- \u00b7 Shareholder remuneration higher than our peers\n\n## 2021-2025 Strategic Plan\n\nIn November, Repsol unveiled its Strategic Plan for the period 2021-2025 (the Plan), which will shape the company's transformation in the coming years and speed up the energy transition. Repsol shall prioritize profitable growth and maximize shareholder value with a strong increase in cash flow generation and financial discipline.\n\nThe Plan sets a roadmap for reducing emissions that is more ambitious than the December 2019 commitment, so as to continue successfully advancing towards the goal of zero net emissions by 2050 through decarbonization of the asset portfolio and a new operating model.\n\nRepsol will evolve its organization by deploying four business areas (Upstream, Industrial, CustomerCentric and Low Carbon Generation), with planned investments in low carbon initiatives totaling 5.5 billion euros (30% of the total) over the period.\n\nShareholder remuneration will combine cash payments with share buybacks. The dividend will rise from 0.60 euros per share to 0.75 euros per share over the period of the Plan (including share buybacks, it may exceed 1 euro per share by 2025). Even in tough price scenarios, cash will be generated to cover investments, shareholder remunerations and finish the Plan with a debt level similar to that of 2020.\n\nFor further information, see Section 3. New Strategic Plan.",

Temporary production halts took place at certain assets in Canada, the United States and Colombia. Profitable growth was pursued, one highlight being the successful exploration campaign, with discoveries in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia, as well as the start of production of new development wells at Marcellus, Norway, Eagle Ford and Trinidad and Tobago. For more information, see Section 7.1. Upstream.\n\nIn the Industrial segment, against the background of a deep and sharp reduction in demand, production, logistics and commercial patterns  adjusted to keep utilization levels above international averages. Repsol continued to focus on innovation and digitalization. New projects have been launched in line with the Group's strategy of decarbonization and the circular economy, to minimize energy efficiency, operational reliability and to minimize environmental impact.\n\nFor more information, see Section 7.2. Industrial.\n\nAt Commercial and Renewables , the mobility restrictions had a negative impact on demand for oil products and, in particular, fuels, despite which Repsol kept its service stations up and running even at the most critical junctures. In 2020, our customer-centric multienergy offering model continued through development of the Electricity and Gas businesses (1.13 million customers), the launch of a new 100% renewable self-consumption service ('Solmatch') and forward steps in renewable projects (Delta and WindFloat came online, start of construction of Kappa in Ciudad Real and Valdesolar in Badajoz, Delta 2 acquisition in Aragon, and international expansion in Chile).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Innovative industrial, circular economy and decarbonization projects.\n- \u00b7 Increase in renewable generation capacity\n- \u00b7 International expansion of renewable generation in Chile\n\nFor more information, see Section 7.3. Commercial and Renewables.\n\nRepsol is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has continued to make progress with its own Sustainability Plans both globally and locally in more than 20 countries and industrial complexes. In the context of an energy transition to a lowemission future that mitigates the effects of climate\n\nchange , commitments were fulfilled to reduce the Carbon Intensity Index by 3% by 2020 compared to 2016 and to implement improvements at facilities, preventing CO2 emissions of 444 thousand metric tons.\n\nFor Repsol, employee safety and job security have always been a key priority during the COVID-19 crisis. In this context, a set of measures have been put in place to protect their health and safety , though without this affecting operations or the level of service offered, and the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for accidents has fallen.\n\nRepsol has not been immune to the impact that the health and social crisis caused by COVID-19 has had on the communities in which it operates. To help mitigate its effects, various actions and initiatives have been carried out, such as selfless collaboration with public services, donations of sanitary materials, support for contractors, or the deliberate cutting off of vulnerable indigenous communities.\n\nFor further information, see Section 8. Sustainability.\n\n## Performance and financial position\n\nThe financial performance of our businesses has been impacted by the current global economic recession , the decline in oil and gas prices, the dramatic slump in demand for products and the cost overruns associated with operating safely amid the pandemic, albeit mitigated in part by the initiatives rolled out under the Resilience Plan.\n\nCommitment to industrial employment and safety.\n\nDriving forward a multi-energy o/ffering.",

Results at the Industrial segment (297 million euros) were impacted by quieter levels of activity and by the decline in Refining margins due to falling levels of demand. Results at the Commercial and Renewables businesses (485 million euros) remained relatively stable thanks to cost and margin management, despite the reduction in sales -especially at Service Stations and in Aviation- due to the mobility restrictions put in place to combat COVID-19. At Corporate and others , finance expenses and corporate overheads were down, in line with the objectives set out in the\n\nResilience Plan.\n\nAs a result, adjusted net income , which shows ordinary results obtained from managing the businesses, amounted to 600 million euros, 71% down on the same period in the previous year. The Company's integrated business model, together with its flexibility and the resilience of its assets, was vital in enabling its businesses to achieve this positive result in such an adverse environment.\n\nMeanwhile, the volatility and sharp decline in international prices for crude oil and other products had an extraordinary adverse impact on the value of inventories, generating an inventory e/uniFB00ect of -978 million euros.\n\nNegative net income due to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nNet Debt reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeanwhile, special items (-2,911 million euros) reflect the write-downs made to certain assets at the Upstream segment as a result of the updated assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices amid the COVID-19 crisis and expectations of an accelerated energy transition.\n\nOn balance, the Group's net income in the period came to -3,289 million euros (-3,816 million euros in 2019). For more information, see Section 6.1 Results.\n\nAlthough the ongoing crisis has led to a significant reduction in EBITDA, cash flows from operations were positive across all businesses, amounting to 3,197 million euros, with free cash flow of 1,979 million euros. For more information, see Section 6.2 Cash flows.\n\nThe measures rolled out under the Resilience Plan to protect the balance sheet have enabled the Company to reduce net debt to 3,042 million euros, with a leverage ratio of 12.8%. The group has strengthened its financial position by issuing senior Eurobonds in the period (2,350 million euros) and perpetual subordinated bonds (1.5 billion euros), while also arranging a total of 1,605 million euros in committed and undrawn credit facilities. Liquidity at the end of the period totalled 9,195 million euros (including committed and undrawn credit facilities), enough to cover short-term maturities by a factor of 3.2.\n\nIn 2020, rating agencies Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch all confirmed Repsol's investment grade . For further information, see Section 6.3 Financial position.\n\nShareholder remuneration in 2020 was equivalent to 0.916 euros per share1 1 under the 'Repsol Flexible Dividend' program. With the aim of improving the shareholder remuneration, Repsol reduced capital in 2020 in order to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip dividends carried out in 2019 under the 'Repsol Flexible Dividend' program. For further information, see Section 6.4 Shareholder remuneration.",

COVID-19: impacts and Resilience Plan\n\n## COVID-19: main impacts\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization upgraded the public health crisis posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (widely known as coronavirus or COVID-19) to international pandemic status. COVID-19 spread swiftly to many countries and is currently active. An unprecedented health, social and economic crisis arose on a truly global scale.\n\nCOVID-19 impacted the prices of hydrocarbons and by-products ( see section 5.2 Energy environment and 9.1 Outlook for the energy sector ) and demand for our products decreased amid the slump in economic activity, especially the lockdown measures to fight the spread of the pandemic.\n\nEven in these tough circumstances, Repsol managed to maintain the safe operation of its businesses, most of which are classified as \"essential\" or \"strategic\" activities in the countries where it is present. However, the overall decline in business volume and the deterioration of economic conditions amid the pandemic have affected the activities and performance of the Company's businesses:\n\n## Upstream\n\nAs a result of the weak demand and price environment for oil and gas, Upstream performance and activities were significantly affected ( see section 7.1. Upstream ). To mitigate adverse impacts, activity was reduced by limiting investment and adjusting activity according to criteria of profitability and asset value preservation:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment adjustment in the period resulted in (i) a slowdown in development work at Akac\u00edas in Colombia, (ii) a delay in the startup of YME in Norway until 2021 and (iii) minimization of drilling at unconventional assets in North America.\n- \u00b7 Production was cut by slightly more than 15 kboe/d as a result of: (i) a decline in gas demand (Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru and Indonesia), (ii) temporary cease of production due to low prices, to preserve the value of certain assets (Colombia, Canada and the US Gulf of Mexico) and (iii) production cuts in some countries (Algeria and Norway).\n\n## Industrial businesses\n\nAt Refining , the drop in global demand prompted a temporary shutdown of refineries across the world, including Europe. Repsol's refining system had to reduce utilization but nonetheless managed to maintain reasonable levels of activity by balancing production, sales and storage capacity.\n\nThis price environment has also had a negative impact on inventory valuation, manifested in the form of the \"inventory effect\" .\n\nIn Chemicals , the impact of the pandemic has been uneven across the different sectors in which products are sold. In global terms, demand has remained at reasonable levels, which has allowed to maintain plant occupancy rates.\n\n## Commercial businesses\n\nDecrease in demand for fuels as a result of lockdown measures and the overall decline in economic activity was severe, especially with regard to the network of service stations and aviation supplies.\n\nIn Spain, when the lockdown was at its strictest, the decline in fuel demand at service stations reached 85%. It later recovered to end the year 23% below the 2019 level. The demand for aviation kerosene collapsed due to lower domestic consumption and the lack of an international market for this product. Elsewhere, at the LPG business, the mobility restrictions have led to a decline in demand in the catering, hospitality, services and automotive segments, partially offset by increased demand for LPG for domestic use.\n\nIt is hard to predict to what extent and for how long the pandemic will affect Repsol's businesses in future. The reduced global demand for crude oil, gas and oil products in response to the slump in economic activity, especially the mobility restrictions in place, may adversely affect prices and the level of production and sales of our businesses. Meanwhile, the deterioration in global financial conditions may also affect the cost of financing, available liquidity or the solvency of our clients and partners under joint ventures, among other possible impacts. The course of the pandemic, vaccine development and administration plans, the containment measures\n\nDrop in prices and falling demand",

This prompted the Company to make the following decisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Guaranteeing the health and safety of employees, customers and suppliers alike in their relations with the Company, while continuing with its operations in order to supply energy products and services that are crutial for society and to maintain essential services at the present time.\n- \u00b7 Maintain our shareholder remuneration commitment in 2020 (paid out of 2019 results).\n- \u00b7 Reaffirm our pledge to lead the energy transition, in line with the objectives of the Paris Summit and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, maintaining its objective of reducing the Carbon Intensity Score by 3% in 2020 compared to 2016, while significantly increasing renewable generation capacity and reducing CO2 emissions across all businesses.\n- \u00b7 Adopt a 2020 Resilience Plan, where the financial objective has been to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and maintain an investment grade credit rating. Even in this scenario, therefore, there will be no increase in net debt in 2020 when compared to year-end 2019.\n- \u00b7 The Resilience Plan envisaged a number of initiatives to further cut operating expenses by over 350 million euros and investment by over 1 billion euros, while also improving working capital approximately 800 million euros with respect to the metrics initially budgeted.\n\nThe objectives of the Resilience Plan were achieved and even surpassed in some cases:\n\n- \u00b7 Repsol assured the supply of our products and services and kept our operations safe and secure. For instance, in Spain, even at the time of the strictest lockdown, the networks of service stations, direct fuel sales and LPG distribution remained operational. Production continued in our refining and chemical industrial complexes.\n- \u00b7 Our commitment to remunerate stockholders in 2020 was delivered through the payment in January and July of EUR 0.424 and EUR 0.492 per share under the scrip dividend scheme to replace the dividend paid out of 2019 results. A capital reduction was excuted through redemption of the Company's treasury shares to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip dividend formula.\n- \u00b7 The Carbon Intensity Index was cut by 5% compared to 2016, while progress was achieved in increasing renewable generation capacity and reducing CO2 emissions across all businesses.\n- \u00b7 The main rating agencies confirmed Repsol's investment grade, which bolstered its balance sheet by strengthening equity (issue of 1.5 billion euros of perpetual subordinated bonds), reducing net debt and increasing liquidity.\n- \u00b7 Higher than expected operating cost savings and investment reductions were achieved, enabling us to reduce net debt compared to 2019 despite the worse scenario than the one considered in March 2020, when the Resilience Plan was launched.",

Macroeconomic environment\n\n## Recent economic trends\n\nIn 2020 the global economy experienced an unprecedented shock due to the spread of the coronavirus and the containment measures taken to alleviate the health crisis.\n\nThe sheer scale and speed of the collapse in global economic activity seen between mid-March and the end of April 2020 was unprecedented. In April, when activity bottomed out in many countries, it is estimated that the global economy was contracting by 20% year-on-year. In May and June, as many economies relaxed restrictions after the \" big lockdown \", activity began to recover.\n\nRecent macroeconomic developments have been shaped by two factors: i) a faster than expected recovery when restrictions have been lifted, partly because of strong support in the form of economic policies. This resulted in a particularly positive third quarter of 2020 for economic activity, revealing a still partial though vigorous recovery; ii) the new waves of the pandemic and threats of new strains, which have forced a further tightening of restrictions, especially in Europe. Despite everything, the new restrictions put in place have not been as widespread and harsh as those seen in the spring. Therefore, the impact has been somewhat less harsh and also varies by sector. While certain services are suffering, manufacturing remains buoyant thanks to the order backlog and by a still vigorous external demand.\n\nAccording to the latest estimated released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF, World Economic Outlook - January 2021) after the world economy grew by 2.8% in 2019, it looks to have dipped 3.5% in 2020, equivalent to a cut of 6.8 points in comparison with pre-COVID estimates.\n\nFor developed economies, GDP change in 2020 is forecast at -4.9%. The contraction is estimated to be less in the United States (-3.4%) than in the Euro Zone (-7.2%), while Spain was one of the most affected economies (-11.0%). For the emerging economies as a whole a fall in activity of -2.4% is projected for 2020, but this hides the differential behavior of China, which is expected to grow by +2.3%. Some Latin American countries and India may experience significant contractions.\n\nAfter the onset of the pandemic, at an early stage of increased uncertainty, the dollar became a safe haven. This led to a further appreciation of the dollar, which reached 1.08USD/EUR during part of February and March. Yet once central bank measures alleviated the shortage of dollar funding and financial stresses eased, the dollar began to depreciate and climbed past 1.20USD/ EUR by year-end 2020, where it has since stabilized. The dollar weakened because the interest rate differential between the United States and the Euro Zone narrowed (to stimulate the economy, the Fed again reduced rates to zero, the minimum level, while the ECB already had rates at the minimum level, so was unable to make further decreases).\n\nFuente:\n\n0 Bloomberg y Direcci\u00f3n de Estudios de Repsol\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.2. Energy landscape\n\n## Crude oil - Brent\n\nBrent crude averaged 41.8 $/bbl in 2020. Brent crude began the year at around $68/bbl, before dropping to below $20/bbl in April and then recovering to above $50/bbl late in the year.\n\nCrude oil prices have been heavily affected by the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis triggered an unprecedented contraction in oil consumption. The drastic measures rolled out by governments to control the spread of the virus by limiting social interaction, imposing significant mobility restrictions and closing borders and non-essential sectors, directly impacted the consumption of oil products. During the most critical lockdown period in the second quarter, the contraction in global oil consumption was -16.4 million bbl/d, bringing demand levels down to those of the 2004-2005 period.",

        "page_content": "On the supply side, the reaction of both OPEC and non-OPEC lent some support to prices. In April, OPEC+ agreed on the largest and longest staggered production cut in its history, while in the rest of the countries we witnessed the natural dynamic whereby falling prices triggered a decline in investment and consequently a fall in production; the main difference being that in the current climate this dynamic was a more rapid affair than on previous occasions.\n\nDespite these adjustments, it was not until November that crude oil prices rebounded steadily to over 45 $/bbl in response to announcements by pharmaceutical companies about effective vaccines at their final stages of clinical research. This gave the market a more realistic expectation of recovery, especially by 2021. However, the context remained complex, with demand still sluggish due to the impact of COVID-19 and supply facing the return of Libyan production and weaknesses in the enforcement of cuts by some OPEC+ members.\n\nAs a result, in the first half of 2020 there was an oversupply position, with an unprecedented build-up of inventories. But, as of the second half of the year, there was a gradual decline in inventories, which, however, has left 2020 with an average build-up of about 2.5 million bbl/d.\n\n## Brent crude price evolution (USD/bbl)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Natural Gas - Henry Hub\n\nThe price of U.S. Henry Hub natural gas averaged $2.1/MBtu in 2020, trading about 19 % below its level in 2019. Persistently high production levels and mild winter temperatures continued to apply pressure on gas prices during the early months of the year. This situation was then aggravated by the emergence of COVID-19 and the lockdown measures put in place to stop it from spreading, which dampened demand and caused an even greater reduction in prices. Turning to U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, canceled loads in the wake of the pandemic placed further pressure on prices. With low Henry Hub prices and declining crude oil prices, output was also driven down. However, from September to the end of the year there was a gradual price recovery supported by seasonal demand and revived export flows. This weighed more on the price than the slight productive uptick.\n\nAccording to the latest figures released in the United States, if this trend continues -limited production growth and a recovery in domestic demand and exports- then looking ahead to next year we can expect to see an average price above the 2020 level as a result of this closer supply-demand balance.\n\nFor more information, see Section 9.1 Outlook for the energy sector.\n\n## Henry Hub price evolution (USD/MBtu)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHenry Hub 2020 average",

Overview\n\nResults in 2020 were affected by the global economic recession stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, with low crude oil prices (Brent 41.8 vs 64.2 in 2019) and gas prices (Henry Hub 2.1 vs. 2.6 in 2019), a dramatic decline in product demand, a reduction in the Refining margin indicator in Spain ($2.2/bbl vs. $5.0/bbl in 2019) and a weaker dollar versus the euro (\u20ac/$1.14 vs. 1.12 in 2019), more pronounced in the second half of the year).\n\nAdjusted net income for 2020 amounted to 600 million euros, notably down on the previous year (-71%), largely as a result of the price decline and the resulting effort to optimize production, plus operational problems due to security issues in Libya at Upstream, lower demand and a reduction in Refining margins, and lower sales at Mobility due to the mobility restrictions put in place to combat COVID-19.\n\nRepsol posted net income of -3,289 million euros, due to the negative impact of reference commodity prices on the valuation of inventories (-978 million euros, reflected in the so-called inventory effect) and the significant write-downs recognized for certain Upstream assets after reviewing assumptions of future crude oil and gas prices (-2,821 million euros under special items).\n\nDespite the extremely challenging environment, the 2020 Resilience Plan enabled Repsol to achieve positive operating cash flow (3,197 million euros) across all businesses, cover net investments (1,218 million euros) and interest payments, and observe its shareholder remuneration commitments in 2020, which included the share buyback program. At yearend, net debt without leases came to 3,042 million euros (6,778 million euros with leases), revealing a leverage ratio of 12.8% (24.8% with leases) and liquidity of 9,195 million euros, enough to cover short-term maturities by a factor of 3.2.\n\n## 6.1.

This decline was largely due to production stoppages in Libya (through to October), the cesation or temporary reduction of operations at certain assets as a result of falling demand and prices, and natural decline at oil and gas fields.\n\nIn relation to exploration activity , the drilling of nine exploration wells was completed in 2020, seven of them yielding a positive result. While exploration activity and investment has declined significantly, hydrocarbon discoveries have been made in the United States, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico.\n\nFor further information on the activities of the Upstream segment, see Section 7.1 Upstream.",

Investment activity focused on production and/or development assets in Norway, the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. Exploratory investment was focused largely on the United States (Alaska and Gulf of\n\nMexico) and Mexico (Gulf of Mexico) and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia, Indonesia and Russia.\n\n## Industrial\n\nAdjusted net income in 2020 amounted to 297 million euros, compared to 913 million euros in 2019.\n\nThe main reasons for this change are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  At Refining , the lower results in Spain arising from tighter margins and decreased sales due to the worsening international environment, was partially offset by production adjustment and plant logistics measures and by improved margins in Peru.\n- \u00b7  At Chemicals , the drop in earnings was largely down to lower margins and sales, amid slumping demand in the automotive industry and other sectors and the maintenance work carried out in the first quarter at the Sines and Tarragona facilities.\n- \u00b7  At Trading , the lower results were largely affected by the Crude Oil segment in response to quieter demand in Brazil and North America.\n- \u00b7  At Wholesale &  Gas Trading , better margins and inventory valuation at the Gas & Trading business in North America, were partially offset by the reduction in margins at the LNG Commercialization business.\n\nOperating investments at the Industrial segment in 2020 amounted to 565 million euros, down 36% on 2019 as envisioned in the Resilience Plan.

In 2019, this heading mainly showed accounting writedowns for certain Upstream assets (-4,849 million euros) and provisions to cover litigation\n\nrisks from the arbitration proceedings with Addax (-837 million euros; see Note 15  of the 2020 consolidated Financial Statements ).\n\n|                                         | (Millions of euros)   | (Millions of euros)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Special Items                           | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Divestments                             | 174                   | 49                    |\n| Indemnities and workforce restructuring | (124)                 | (64)                  |\n| Impairment of assets (1)                | (2,182)               | (4,867)               |\n| Provisions and others (2)               | (149)                 | (941)                 |\n| TOTAL                                   | (2,911)               | (5,823)               |\n\nAccordingly, the Group's net income in 2020 totalled -3,289 million euros, versus -3,816 million euros in 2019.\n\n| Profitability indicators                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| ROACE - Return on average capital  employed (%) (1) | (11.9) | (11.0) |\n| Earnings per share (\u20ac/share)                        | (2.13) | (2.33) |\n\n## Asset impairment and write-downs\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the environment in which some of our businesses are expected to operate in the immediate future. The depth and scale of this unprecedented crisis make forecasts inherently uncertain, although at this time, following various announcements of a vaccine, we can already see signs of an economy recovery and a gradual stabilization of the Oil&Gas markets. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that this recovery will continue and that we will see a return to pre-crisis scenarios from 2023 onwards. We also saw further pledges from governments in the latter half of the year, in line with the Paris climate goals, which will foreseeably speed up the decarbonization of the world economy and the energy transition this entails. ( See Section 3. New Strategic Plan and 9.2 Outlook for our businesses )\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Repsol has downgraded its expectations as to the future prices of crude oil and gas and therefore recognized impairment and writedowns on certain assets:\n\n## Investment boost to new renewable projects",

Meanwhile, an impairment of tax credits (-113 million euros) was recognized in Canada due to the expected difficulty of recovering them.\n\nThe absence of significant impairment allowances at the Industrial and Commercial and Renewables segments is testament to the quality of the assets and the ability of the business models to adapt to the new environment.\n\nFor further information on the impairment recognized in the period, see Note 20 of the 2020 consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 6.2.

The sharp reduction in EBITDA due to lower activity (lower prices and demand) at most of the Group's businesses as a result of COVID-19 was cushioned by the effect of the lower cost of inventories on working capital (price of inventories at the industrial businesses) and lower taxes.\n\nCash flows from investing activities (-1,218 million euros) were up on 2019, following a marked reduction in investments at Upstream (59%) and at Industrial (35%), as envisioned in the Resilience Plan, but maintaining investment in the new electricity and renewables businesses in alignment with the new strategic approach and the pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This heading also shows the amount of tax returned from previous years following the sale of Naturgy and the divestment in Vietnam.\n\nFree cash flow amounted to 1,979 million euros, slightly down on the 2,060 reported in 2019, despite the current environment.\n\nAs a result of all of the above, and after meeting borrowing costs (-444 million euros), shareholder remuneration (-346 million euros) and treasury share acquisition ( see Section 6.4 Shareholder remuneration ), cash generation was a positive 811 million euros, showing an improvement on 2019, thanks to quieter levels of treasury share investment and interest.",

Shareholder remuneration\n\nRepsol does not have a formal policy on dividends, and the Company's eventual decisions on shareholder remuneration depend on several factors, including the performance of its businesses and its operating results. Shareholder remuneration in 2020 and 2019 under the ' Repsol Flexible Dividend ' 1 program is:\n\n- \u00b7  Remuneration of \u20ac0.916/share 2 in 2020. Repsol paid out a total gross amount of 343 million euros to shareholders and delivered 98,982,965 new shares, for an equivalent amount of 1,075 million euros, to those who opted to receive new shares in the Company.\n\n- \u00b7  Remuneration of \u20ac0.916/share 3 in 2019, with Repsol paying out a gross total of 398 million euros to shareholders and delivered 71,394,987 new shares, equivalent to 1,017 billion euros, to those who opted to receive new shares in the Company.\n\nIn October 2020, capital was reduced through redemption of treasury shares as approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2020, to offset the dilutive effect of the bonus share issues formalized in 2020 under the \"Repsol Flexible Dividend\" program.\n\nIn addition, in January 2021, under that program, replacing what would have been the interim dividend from 2020 profits, Repsol paid out 102 million euros in cash (0.288 euros gross per right) to those shareholders opting to sell their bonus share rights back to the Company, and delivered 40,494,510 shares, worth 338 million euros, to those opting to take their dividend in the form of new shares in the parent Company. At the date of publication of this Management Report, the Board of Directors has agreed to implement a Share Repurchase Programme for a maximum of 40,494,510 shares, accounting for approximately 2.58% of the current share capital. The sole purpose of this programme is to acquire the shares that will be redeemed if the Capital Reduction to be proposed at next annual General Shareholders' Meeting is ultimately approved.\n\nAt the date of authorization for issue of these annual financial statements, the Company's Board of Directors has resolved to propose to shareholders, at the next annual General Shareholders' Meeting, the distribution of a cash dividend amounting to 0.60 euros gross per share. Of this amount, the Board will propose that the gross sum of 0.30 per share be paid out of 2020 earnings as from 7 July 2021, and 0.30 euros per share 4 be paid out of unrestricted reserves, if applicable, as from 1 January 2022 and by no later than 31 January 2022, on a date to be determined by the Board of Directors. These proposals replace the Repsol Flexible Dividend remuneration program that Repsol has been running in recent years.\n\nFor further information on expected future shareholder remuneration, see Section 3.

        "page_content": "## Main events of the period\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 and price review\n\nThe pandemic and the pricing environment significantly affected Upstream operations. Activity was reduced, investments were limited and operations were adjusted (with the consequent drop in production) according to criteria of profitability and asset value in accordance with the new Strategic Plan and the Resilience Plan ( see Section 2. COVID-19: Impacts and Resilience Plan ).\n\nIn the context of the 2020 Resilience Plan and taking a further step toward a more efficient, flexible and nimble organization where talent, leadership, digitalization and new ways of working continue to move forward, organizational changes were implemented during 2020. At Upstream, Repsol, developed a simpler organization with a smaller management structure to move along a roadmap drawn by the new Strategic Plan of geographic concentration, focus on cash generation in low price scenarios and flexibility of investments in unconventional and short cycle projects, prioritizing value over volume.\n\nFuture price patterns and production plans for certain assets were reviewed, which led to impairments of some assets as described in Section 6.1 of this report and in Note 20 of the 2020 consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Average production\n\nAverage production in 2020 was 648 kboe/d, 9% less than in 2019. The decline was mainly due to production stoppages (Libya), natural decline of fields (Canada, Trinidad), temporary cease of productions due to the price environment in Chauvin (Canada) and Akacias (Colombia), lower gas demand (Peru, Algeria and Indonesia) and expiration of the license for Piedemonte (Colombia), partly offset by the acquisition of an additional 63% in Eagle Ford (USA) at the end of 2019, the connection of new wells, mainly in Marcellus (USA), and the start of production in Buckskin (USA) in June 2019.\n\n## Exploration campaign\n\nIn 2020, we finished drilling 7 exploration and 2 appraisal wells, 7 with positive results (3 exploration and 1 appraisal in the United States -2 exploration wells in Alaska and 1 appraisal well in the Gulf of Mexico-, 2 exploration wells in Mexico and 1 in Colombia), 1 exploration well with negative results in Mexico and 1 appraisal well under evaluation in Colombia.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the BSC-X1ST exploration well in Bolivia - subsequently yielding a positive result in 2021-  and one appraisal well in Indonesia was in progress.\n\n## Acreage\n\nIn 2020, exploration blocks were acquired in Indonesia (Aru, with a stake of 100%) and Russia (Sablerskiy, as part of the AROG Joint Venture, with a stake of 49%). In Norway, Repsol acquired development block PL-055E (Brage site), with a stake of 33.84%. In the United States, 9 blocks were acquired in the Gulf of Mexico (5 in the Walker Ridge area and 4 in Keathley Canyon). Also in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an agreement was reached with Shell to acquire an 8.5% interest at 8 blocks in the Alaminos Canyon area.\n\n## Reserves\n\nThe change in proven reserves in 2020 was -50 Mboe, mainly by negative changes in activity plans (extensions and discoveries) and negative reviews. The Proven reserves replacement ratio, calculated as the quotient between the total additions of proven reserves in the period and the production of the period, was -21% in 2020 (23% in 2019).\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\nIn terms of the environmental performance of the Upstream business in 2020, the concept of the Circular Economy was successfully implemented.\n\nAs the first oil and gas company to apply the 'Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) Management Ladder' methodology, and thanks to its concern for biodiversity, Repsol was awarded an exceptionally good score on the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors scale, ahead of its competitors, according to data from Sustainalytics and Vigeo Eiris, which focus on countries in the parts of the world where Repsol has Upstream operations.",

For further information, see Note 14 of the 2020 consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Indonesia: sale of 27% of the South East Jambi block, new acreage, new CO2 storage project and approval of the Kaliberau Dalam development\n\nIn February, the Company announced the sale of 27% of the South East Jambi onshore block to Pertamina Hulu Energy (subsidiary of state-owned company Pertamina). Despite the deal, Repsol will remain the operator of the block, with a 40% stake.\n\nRepsol has acquired the new Aru exploration block in the Biak offshore basin, with a stake of 100%.\n\nIn October, the GCS (Geological Carbon Storage) project was launched in Sakakemang. The project is aligned with our commitment to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. For Repsol, this is a pioneering initiative in carbon capture and storage, comparable in size to others worldwide. We expect to capture 2 million tons (Mtn) of carbon annually, to total 30 Mtn over the life of the project, starting in 2026 and ending in 2040.\n\nThe development plan for the Kaliberau field at Sakakemang has recently been approved by the Indonesian government.

The Company's refineries have been effective at throttling production to prevailing market needs and have shown great flexibility in terms of logistics and storage, allowing the continuous supply of essential products.\n\nDespite the drop in international demand and low production margins throughout 2020, activity continued at all the Industrial Complexes, showing that Repsol's refineries have a highly competitive scheme and are able to adapt to the energy landscape. This ability to adapt enabled some Industrial Complex units to be temporarily halted during periods of lower margins -mainly some of the crude oil distillation units- and to continue highermargin processes, such as deep conversion units (hydrocrackers and cokers).\n\nIn this international context of low margins due to a non-structural decline in demand, in 2020 the refining margin indicator in Spain stood at 2.2 dollars per barrel, down from the margin in 2019 (5.0 dollars per barrel). In Peru, the refining margin indicator stood at 8.6 dollars per barrel, compared to 6.2 dollars per barrel in 2019, as a result of the efficiencies achieved in crude oil procurement, production of low-sulfur fuel oil and price mechanisms in the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Peru, the level of use was lower than in 2019, falling from 75% to 65% in 2020.\n\nDespite the tough energy landscape, Repsol launched the development of several major projects in Spain to cut greenhouse gas emissions and achieve the goal of becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050. The project at the most advanced stage of development, which has already passed the final phase of approval, is the construction in Cartagena of an industrial facility to generate 250 kt per year of advanced HVO from waste, which will be up and running by 2023. In addition, within the production line for synthetic fuels with zero carbon emissions, two projects stand out. The first project entails the construction of one of the world's largest synthetic fuel production plants, which will utilize CO2 and green hydrogen generated from water using renewable energy. The second is a circular economy project, involving construction of a plant for generating fuel gas from urban waste. Its production will replace part of the consumption of traditional fuels used in Petronor's production process, thus reducing the carbon footprint of all fuels generated at the refinery.\n\n## (Thousand tons)\n\n| Processed raw material   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Crude oil                | 36,056 | 39,735 |\n| Other raw materials      | 7,386  | 12,441 |\n| Total                    | 43,442 | 52,176 |\n\n| Sustainability performance                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Oil spills (>1 bbl) reaching the environment (t) | 1.53   | 3.24   |\n| CO2e emissions (Mt) (Scope 1 + 2)                | 7.67   | 8.72   |\n| TRIR                                             | 1.20   | 1.90   |\n| PSIR                                             | 0.31   | 0.45   |\n| Voluntary social investment (thousands of \u20ac)     | 1,366  | 1,636  |\n\n## 7.2.2.

Hence factory usage in the year exceeded that of the previous year, which was impacted by the multi-year scheduled shutdown of the Tarragona complex.\n\nIn 2020, sales to third parties amounted to 2,729 million tons, in line with the 2019 figure.\n\n| Thousand tons Sales by product   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Base petrochemicals              | 817    | 829    |\n| Derivative petrochemicals  (1)   | 1,912  | 1,958  |\n| Total                            | 2,729  | 2,787  |\n| Sales by market                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Europe                           | 2,083  | 2,289  |\n| Rest of the world                | 646    | 498    |\n| Total                            | 2,729  | 2,787  |\n\n(1) Includes ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA) copolymers.\n\nIn terms of investments, these were mainly aimed at improving and optimizing assets, boosting efficiency, reducing costs, boosting differentiation, widening the product range, and improving quality, safety and environmental standards.\n\nIn 2020, in line with the division's focus on innovation, the highlights were:\n\n- \u00b7  All the Group's petrochemical complexes were certified for production of circular polyolefins. Circular polyolefins are created by replacing part of the conventional raw material with an oil from chemical recycling of plastic waste not recyclable mechanically. ISCC PLUS certification had been awarded to Puertollano in 2019. The rest of centers joined in 2020. Repsol is the first petrochemical company to certify all its complexes.\n- \u00b7  The product range widened with new materials for 3D printing and a full range of phthalate-free polypropylenes. This range gradually widened following Repsol's public commitment in November 2015 to eliminate phthalates from all its products. Hence, the Company is a leader of this change in the market and the transition toward products that are free of substances with specific migration rates, such as phthalate.\n- \u00b7  Forward steps in Repsol's range of polyolefins with high recycled content.In this product line, Repsol reached agreements with clients and recyclers to support the circular economy. These alliances help create the necessary synergies to speed up the implementation of circular solutions.\n- \u00b7  In June, a new reactor for one of the polypropylene plants was delivered at the Tarragona Industrial Complex. The Company will use this second gas phase reactor to manufacture high-impact-resistant polypropylene for the automotive market. These product grades make vehicles lighter, improving their environmental footprint and significantly increasing the impact resistance that protects the inside of the passenger compartment, thus bolstering passenger safety.\n- \u00b7  For the fifth consecutive year, Repsol won awards from the European association of plastic processors, winning four of the ten accolades. The Company won the Awards for Best Producer of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), and Polypropylene (PP), and the Global Circularity Award covering all types of polymers.\n\n| Sustainability performance                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Oil spills (>1 bbl) reaching the environment (t) | -      | -      |\n| CO2e emissions (Mt) (Scope 1 + 2)                | 3.30   | 3.36   |\n| TRIR                                             | 1.32   | 1.35   |\n| PSIR                                             | -      | 0.14   |\n| Voluntary social investment (thousands of \u20ac)     | 232    | 265    |\n\n## 2,729 Mt\n\nsales of petrochemical products in 2020",

Trading\n\nThe main function of Trading is to optimize the supply and marketing of the Group's positions in international markets (integrated supply chain) and its activity consists of i) the supply of crude oil and products for Refining systems and other Group needs, ii) the marketing of crude oil and associated products from its own production, iii) the maritime transport of crude oil and derivative products associated with these activities, and iv) the management of crude oil and product hedges in the financial derivative markets.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 1,518 vessels were chartered (1,635 in 2019) and 369 voyages were made through the Time Charter fleet (374 in 2019).\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\nAs to safety and the environment in 2020, Repsol Trading supported the technological transition with two digital projects: incident management and implementation of the new vetting process in the Downstream division.\n\nTo launch the first initiative, the ship incident and emergency management process was digitized, thus allowing for an automatic preliminary assessment of the impact of any incident reported to Repsol Trading by a chartered or proprietary ship transporting goods.\n\nAs to the second initiative, the process validates the ship by ensuring that the latest available information is reviewed with respect to safety and the environment, with the ultimate aim of reducing the number of incidents and their consequences.\n\nIn addition, the following initiatives were carried out:\n\n- \u00b7  In 2020, Repsol Trading certified under the Italian National Sustainability Verification System, which has specific traceability requirements for marketing biofuels and bioliquids in the Italian market.\n- \u00b7  Regarding circular economy initiatives, in July Repsol certified under the voluntary ISCC PLUS scheme, which allows certifies biological, circular and recycled products in markets other than energy.\n\n## 7.2.4.  Wholesale & Gas Trading\n\n## Assets and operations\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the Group has regasification and transport assets in its North American commercialization businesses, including the Canaport regasification plant and the Canadian and US gas pipelines.\n\nIn the North East United States, where natural gas supply is usually restricted, cold weather scenarios can cause significant spikes in the area's reference prices. The Company's activity in this area focuses on optimizing the margin from the commercialization of regasified LNG from Canaport and natural gas acquired on the market. Repsol also markets and trades natural gas in North America from its own production in the United States (Marcellus) and Canada (Alberta), as well as production acquired from third parties.\n\nMeanwhile, Wholesale & Gas Trading supplies the Repsol Group's gas demand and ensures an efficient supply, as well as commercialization and trading in the Spanish gas system and in the international LNG market.\n\n## Performance: increase in volume sold and competitive provisioning to profit from low market prices\n\n|                                                                  |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| LNG regasified (TBtu) in Canaport (100%)                         |     30 |     24 |\n| Gas sales in North America (TBtu)                                |    717 |    608 |\n| NG and LNG commercialization in Spain   and international (TBtu) |    303 |    225 |\n\nIn 2020, commercial activity in the North East United States was conducted in a context characterized by low price volatility and moderate temperatures during the winter.\n\nThe slowdown in consumption in North America due to COVID-19 was offset by sharp temperature fluctuations over the summer and specific events (hurricanes, forest fires, unscheduled maintenance in the pipeline system, among others), which resulted in increased price volatility in the latter half of the year. The marketing and sales business in North America grasped these opportunities and expanded its customer-facing-business, thus increasing Canaport activity in the summer and strategically positioning itself across the rest of North America.\n\nThe LNG and natural gas marketing and trading activity carried out from Spain was impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The drop in domestic demand was successfully countered by optimizing the gas and LNG portfolio through swap operations with third parties, volume cancellations, logistical optimizations and trading within the gas system. The unit also heavily increased its presence in the international LNG market, where sales were up thanks to a broader base of customers and destinations. A further highlight was the signing of a new long-term contract (ending 2034) for the supply of LNG for delivery in Spain.",

Mobility\n\nDrop in sales due to mobility restriction measures and lower activity\n\n## Assets\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Repsol had 4,966 service stations, with the following geographical distribution:\n\n| Country   | No. of points of sale   |\n|-----------|-------------------------|\n| Spain     | 3,331                   |\n| Portugal  | 496                     |\n| Italy     | 295                     |\n| Mexico    | 255                     |\n| Peru      | 589                     |\n| Total     | 4,966                   |\n\n## Performance: lower activity, but maintaining supply and initiatives to help citizens.\n\nRepsol's challenge is to continue leading the sector in Spain, offering the best service to its customers. The strength of the business model was demonstrated throughout its operations, despite the decrease in demand for fuels as a result of  mobility restrictions and the overall decline in economic activity.\n\n- \u00b7  At Service Stations, fuel sales fell by 23% compared to 2019, while Direct Sales declined to a lesser extent.\n- \u00b7  In Aviation, the collapse in demand for kerosene drove down product sales by approximately 62%.\n- \u00b7  In international mobility (Peru, Portugal, Italy and Mexico), por Service Stations and Direct Sales alike experienced similar changes.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, Repsol implemented cost optimization measures with a focus on products with higher added value, while maintaining the core premise of continuing to provide service to its customers even in this situation.\n\nAdditionally, in 2020, the following initiatives are to be highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7  Since the onset of the crisis in March 2020, most Repsol's Service Stations remained operational to ensure supply, while adapting safety and customer service protocols accordingly. Meanwhile, the Direct Sales network, fishing ports and airport facilities remained fully operational.\n- \u00b7  During the stricter lockdown periods, a special service for transporters has been set up at the Service Stations to give them everything they need to rest, eat, wash and continue their onward journey in optimum safety conditions. Service stations in Spain offered free coffee\n\n- and buns for transporters, emergency services, health care workers, armed forces and the police force.\n- \u00b7  At the onset of the pandemic, services were put in place to enable customers to obtain basic products:\n- -Call Collect : orders could be placed over the phone and then collected in store.\n- -  Agreement with Deliveroo (food delivery company) to facilitate and speed up the supply of staple products during the crisis through the Repsol's Service Stations.\n- \u00b7  These initiatives crystallized as 'Tienda Repsol,' a solution for making purchases through Waylet, where orders can be picked up at Service Stations or home-delivered.\n- \u00b7  In Sestao, Repsol opened the first natural gas station in Bizkaia province with a continuous supply of Compressed Natural Gas, used in light vehicles and some heavy vehicles like buses and short/medium haul service or transport trucks. The investment was made in partnership with Nortegas and the Basque Energy Agency.\n\n| Sustainability performance                                                   |   2020 | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Oil spills(>1 bbl) reaching the environment (t)                              |   2.38 | 63.73  |\n| CO2e emissions (Mt) (Scope 1 + 2)                                            |   0.03 | 0.04   |\n| TRIR                                                                         |   0.62 | 0.66   |\n| % of contracts with human rights,  environmental and anti-corruption clauses | 100    | 100    |\n| Voluntary social investment (thousands of \u20ac)                                 |  14    | -      |\n\n## 7.3.2 LPG\n\n## Assets and operations\n\nRepsol is one of the leading retail distributors of LPG 1 , ranking first in Spain and maintaining top positions in Portugal (third largest operator).",

Repsol has also guaranteed home delivery and the availability of bottled gas at points of sale.\n- \u00b7  Portugal has decreed a maximum price (between April 20 and May 2) for traditional bottles of butane (22 euros for the 13 kg bottle) and propane, except for bottles K-6 and K-11. In Spain, prices for regulated LPG have been limited for three two-month periods.\n- \u00b7  Repsol continue driving geographic growth, including in the French market. In May, Repsol started the commercialization in the Canary Islands with new tracking requirements.\n- \u00b7  In 2020,Repsol drove forward a customerfocused multi-energy strategy by creating products that cross-sell LPG with other energies.\n\n- \u00b7  In Portugal Repsol replaced all bottles. In addition, Repsol reached an agreement with Continente hypermarkets to sell bottles directly out of their stores.\n- \u00b7  In July and September, audits were conducted for the renewal of ISO 45001:18, ISO 14001:15 and ISO 9001:15.\n- \u00b7  Repsol made available to our LPG customers a new voluntary service that helps offset carbon emissions from their ordinary activities. The project contributes to the overall goal of becoming a zero net emissions company by 2050, and reinforces the vision of LPG as efficient and sustainable energy.\n- \u00b7  Repsol factories are certified by the Spanish National Commision on Markets and Competition to ensure that their energy comes from renewable sources.\n\n| Sustainability performance                                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Oil spills (>1 bbl) reaching the environment (t)                             | -      | -      |\n| CO2e emissions (Mt) (Scope 1 + 2)                                            | 0.01   | 0.01   |\n| TRIR                                                                         | 1.86   | 2.43   |\n| PSIR                                                                         | 1.03   | 1.64   |\n| % of contracts with human rights,  environmental and anti-corruption clauses | 100    | 100    |\n\n## 7.3.3.

Both cover areas where the lubricants market is expected to grow the most on average over the coming years.\n\nThe commercial division has a strong international presence, with deliveries in more than 97 countries around the world.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic affected the demand across all lines of business, with a sharp fall in the second quarter (>30%). A partial recovery was seen in the following months, albeit with differences by geography. However, active commercial management and cost optimization measures enabled to significantly exceed the results of the previous year.

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the division has two gas combined cycle plants, in Algeciras (Cadiz) and Escatr\u00f3n (Zaragoza), with a combined capacity of 1,625 MW, and cogeneration plants located in the Group's industrial complexes in Tarragona, Santander and Cartagena within its Chemical and Refining activity, with a combined capacity of 600 MW.\n\nIn 2020, the Delta project came online. It consists of eight wind farms located in Aragon, with a total of 89 wind turbines with 335 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity. It will produce 992 gigawatt per hour (GWh) annually, the equivalent to the average annual consumption of 300,000 homes, and will avoid the emission of one million tons of carbon into the atmosphere per year. Repsol is also involved in the Windfloat Atlantic floating wind farm off the north coast of Portugal, with a total installed capacity of 25 MW (3.4 MW within  Repsol's share) and now fully operational.\n\nThe renewable projects that Repsol is developing in Spain include the PI wind project that straddles the boundaries of Palencia and Valladolid. It will have a total installed capacity of 175 MW. Another photovoltaic plant will come online in Cadiz (Sigma), with 204 MW. In 2020:\n\n- \u00b7  the construction began of its first photovoltaic farm, Kappa, which will have a total installed capacity of 126 MW, in Ciudad Real, and of Valdesolar in Badajoz, with 264 MW.\n- \u00b7  the Delta 2 renewable project was acquired with an installed capacity of 859 MW. It will be built and operated by Repsol, and will be developed over the next three years. The farms will be located in Aragon.\n\nThe Company drove forward its international expansion by reaching a deal in October 2020 with the Ibere\u00f3lica Renovables Group, thus providing access to a portfolio of projects in Chile that Ibere\u00f3lica has in operation, construction or development,  totaling more than 1,600 MW through to 2025  and the possibility of exceeding 2,600 MW by 2030. The  initially planned investment amounts to some 192 million US dollars.\n\nUnder the new Strategic Plan, Repsol    will continue to increase its asset portfolio and its international expansion, with the aim of becoming a global operator with a generation capacity that will reach 7.5 gigawatts (GW) by 2025 and 15 GW by 2030.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2020, electricity production, excluding cogeneration plants, amounted to 5,940 GWh, compared to 6,308 GWh in 2019. The decline in industrial demand and prevailing market conditions drove down levels of production at the combined\n\ncycle plants. Lower water availability in our basins reduced conventional hydro production during the period, though partially offset by higher pumping output due to increased price volatility.\n\n## Electricity and gas commercialization\n\nRepsol has an attractive commercial and  service offer that includes leading-edge digital solutions, electricity certified as 100% low-emission, exclusive advantages for customers and discounts on our network of service stations.\n\nRepsol sells electricity and gas in the retail sector with a base of 1.1 million customers (12% more than in 2019, a share of more than 3% of the market) distributed throughout Spain. In 2020, to enhance the customer experience and provide integrated energy solutions, customers were offered a solution that combines the supply of electricity, a basic energy management service, the supply of LPG and the option to install a self-consumption solution, such as Solify and Solmatch, the first large solar power community in Spain. In April, Repsol launched the second of these, Solmatch, a product that supports distributed generation and consumption of local, 100% renewable energy through installation of solar panels on the roofs of buildings. Connections become available to homes located up to 500 meters away.\n\nAlso in 2020, Repsol was the first of the large electricity and gas retailers to be awarded the low emissions A label.\n\n| Sustainability performance                   |   2020 | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| CO2e (Mt) emissions ( Scope  1 + 2)          |   1.96 | 2.1    |\n| TRIR                                         |   1.45 | -      |\n| Voluntary social investment (thousands of \u20ac) |   1    | -      |\n\nRepsol's electricity generation assets and projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nretail market share of electricity and gas in Spain",

Sustainability\n\n## Sustainability Model\n\nRepsol's Sustainability Policy sets a goal of meeting the growing demand for energy and products, while optimizing the Company's contribution to sustainable development. The Company's business practices seek to create both short-and longterm value by maximizing positive impacts and minimizing negative impacts on society and the environment across the entire value chain, achieved through ethical and transparent behavior. This policy is implemented through a range of internal rules and procedures organized around the Repsol Sustainability Model. This model is structured into the following six axes, which relate to material issues due to the type of Company that Repsol is and the expectations of its stakeholders and leading international standards: climate change, environment, innovation and technology, safe operation, people and ethics and transparency.\n\nEach year this framework is embodied in Repsol's Sustainability Plans. In 2020, Repsol produced its new Global Sustainability Plan (GSP), which sets out the key targets of the Company's strategic plan in the field of Sustainability. The 2020 GSP envisions 39 medium-term objectives built around the six axes of the Sustainability Model and aimed at the Company's businesses, suppliers, customers and employees, as well as society in general. These objectives include, most notably, Repsol's desire to become a net-zero emissions Company by 2050. The Global Sustainability Plan is also fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nBased on the Global Sustainability Plan, Local Plans are rolled out for each country and operational hub, incorporating commitments related to the local context and thus contributing to all the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020, Repsol had a total of 20 Local Plans in place, 14 across its countries (Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, United States, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Peru, United Kingdom, Venezuela) and six at its industrial facilities (Bilbao-Petronor, Cartagena, Coru\u00f1a, Puertollano, Tarragona and Sines).\n\nSince 2014, the Local Sustainability Plans have led to the implementation of over 2,000 initiatives aimed at creating value in the short and medium run, in line with our Sustainability Policy.\n\nFurther information on the global and local sustainability plans can be found at www.repsol. com.\n\n## Repsol and the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nRepsol supports the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and contributes toward its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 7, SDG 8 and SDG 13, due to its role in providing access to energy and its contribution to social and economic development and to combat climate change; SDG 6, SDG 9 and SDG 12, where it prioritizes innovation, sustainable management and the efficient use of resources in its operations; and SDG 17, due to its alliances with other stakeholders and as an active member of industry associations such as IPIECA, OGCI, IOGP, CONCAWE, FUELS EUROPE, CEFIC, the Global Compact and EITI.\n\nIn 2019, Repsol defined a two-year SDG boosting plan to make engagement and dissemination part of the Company's culture on the path to maximizing its contribution to this global agenda. More than 80 initiatives have been carried out under this Support Plan.\n\nEn 2020, Repsol published its first SDG Report for 2019, as a clear example of the Company's pledge to supporting the 2030 Agenda. A second report is being published this year to explain this contribution through more than 30 indicators, as well as various challenges and objectives that show the efforts being made across the Company, both globally and locally, to achieve, together with our other stakeholders, solutions to the social challenges now facing the Company. The SDG Reports are available at www.repsol.com .\n\nIn June 2020, online training was set up via an educational platform to enable employees to discover what the 2030 Agenda is all about through training pills on each of the 17 SDGs, and to find out how the Company is contributing toward these objectives. This training has been designed to be accessible for people with disabilities. Upward of 1,756 employees had already received training by the end of the year.\n\nFor further information on the Company's contribution to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, visit www.repsol.com .",

The management team also conducts specific ESG roadshows, some of which are led by the CEO himself.\n\nThanks to the commitments acquired by Repsol and its responsible management approach, the Company ranks highly within its sector in the ESG performance assessments conducted by the most renowned rating agencies operating within the market (MSCI, Vigeo, Sustainalytics, CDP, etc.).\n\nThe conclusions, messages and feedback obtained through the roadshows and other events such as Sustainability Day are presented to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. After six straight years of holding this event, Sustainability Day could not be held during the year due to the ongoing pandemic. However, in November 2020 Repsol unveiled its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan and staged a roadshow afterwards to provide information about the keys to the Company's transformation in order to meet the objectives set.\n\nAs to ethics and transparency, the Audit and Control Committee attached to the Board and the Ethics and Compliance Committee are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of Ethics and Conduct and for reviewing related projects and their modifications, ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements and are appropriate for the Company.\n\nFurther, senior management defines the Company's objectives, action plans and practices with respect to sustainability. In order to ensure deployment, the Sustainability and Decarbonization objectives entailed, in 2020, up to 25% of the CEO's annual variable remuneration and up to 40% of the 20202023 Long-Term Incentive Program applicable to all management personnel, as well as other employees, including the CEO.",

These employees provide advice on issues related to energy efficiency, Scope 3 emissions management, or low-carbon energy generation, among other drivers of the energy transition.\n\nThe Company's climate change targets have a direct impact on employees' variable remuneration:\n\n- \u00b7  Of these objectives, which are pursued across the entire company in the short term, 20% target sustainability commitments, which focus on the reduction of CO2 emissions and compliance with accident rate reduction goals.\n- \u00b7  Repsol also has a long-term incentive in place for the 2020-2023 horizon, 30% linked to the fulfilment of the company's carbon intensity indicator (CII) reduction pathway and 10% attainment of its renewable generation targets. The aim is to help ensure compliance with the Paris Agreement by bringing about a progressive decarbonization of the Company in a bid to become a net zero emissions company by 2050. This long-term variable remuneration applies to managers and leaders, including the CEO and members of Senior Management.\n\n## 8.1.2. Risks and opportunities\n\nRisks relating to the phenomenon of climate change are subject to growing levels of uncertainty in the medium and long run. Over the next five years, approximately 10% of the Group's risks subject to analysis will be closely related to climate change.\n\nRepsol's process for identifying and assessing the risks associated with long-term climate change is based on a proprietary analysis methodology that follows the medium-term risk analysis approach envisioned in the Enterprise Risk Management System ( see Section 10. Risks and Appendix II ), with the aim of extending the process through to 2050 and bringing it in line with the Company's commitment to achieving net zero emissions. This will support what the Group's Risk Map seeks to achieve, with a five-year horizon looking forward to 2030, 2040 and 2050. The main features are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Based on future scenarios for changes in the energy mix, taking as a reference the scenarios considered by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Probabilistic analysis of scenarios is carried out by a group of the Company's experts in strategy, markets, regulation, finances, reputation, technology and sustainability. Some of these risks may have an adverse or positive impact depending on risk mitigation and climate scenario adaptation strategies, since they imply the emergence of business opportunities that can be unlocked.\n- \u00b7  The most significant emerging and climate change risks for the Company have now been identified. In 2020, the risk of mass infectious diseases was included. A total of 20 emerging and climate change risks have now been identified, sorted by type. A risk taxonomy has been drawn up for this purpose, broken down into climate change and sustainable development risks, socio-political risks, operational risks, reputational risks and technology risks. Of these 20 risks, the 10 that concentrate most of the exposure are prioritized for subsequent analysis.\n- \u00b7  The importance or materiality of each of the risks identified is determined by quantifying its economic impact on the performance of the Company and each of its business units and geographic areas. This process relies on the decarbonization roadmap defined in the Strategic Plan at certain percentiles of the loss probability distribution in 2030, 2040 and 2050.\n\nOn the 2030 horizon , the risk analysis reveals that the probability of suffering negative impacts from the energy transition is low, at less than 5%. In other words, the Company is prepared for even the most rapid transition scenarios thanks to its decarbonization roadmap. Thus, in 2030, the Company has a very high probability (>95%) of being able to harness opportunities that will completely neutralize any potentially negative impacts. This is because of its speed in responding to events and in defining a long-term climate strategy, which places it in a favorable competitive position. Examples of these opportunities include energy efficiency, renewable electricity generation, advanced biofuels, renewable hydrogen, the circular economy and, in the medium to long run, carbon capture and storage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, Repsol's firm commitment to becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050 and its response to different energy transition scenarios go some way to mitigating these risks. According to the climate risk\n\nanalysis, in 2040 and 2050 there is a reasonably high probability (estimated at 50%) that the Company will report positive impacts due to the energy transition, depending on how climate policies evolve, the carbon price signal, the costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and other factors.

        "page_content": "Climate change can exacerbate the adverse weather phenomena to which Repsol is exposed (hurricanes, floods, changes in rainfall or temperature, etc.), which can impact its activities, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Operations affected by water stress, where the rainfall regime could affect the operation of our facilities. In this regard, Repsol has implemented plans to reduce water consumption and increase water reuse.\n- \u00b7  Operations exposed to hurricanes, where business could be disrupted. Repsol draws up Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) in which roles and responsibilities are defined and assigned and additional contingency measures included, such as alternative physical or virtual locations from which to resume business.\n\nOne of the main conclusions of the climate risk analysis is that Repsol is more exposed to transition risks than to physical risks. However, the Company is taking steps to reduce exposure to both.\n\nExposure to climate change risks is different at each of the Company's business units. This exposure, measured in absolute terms, is influenced by the size and scale of each business. The risk analysis reveals that the most exposed units are E&P and Refining. However, it is important to note that the net impact is estimated to be favorable by 2030 for Repsol as a whole and also in 2040 and 2050.\n\nThe exposure of the businesses to each of the risks has been scrutinized and differentiating elements can be seen, due to the specific characteristics of each business (see climate change risk table).\n\nClimate change risks, both physical and transitional, are managed in the same way as the other risks to which the Group is exposed ( see Appendix III or Section 10. Risks ). However, the fact that they are emerging risks means that they will need to scrutinized in greater detail in the long term and mitigated through a long-term commitment such as Net Zero Emissions 2050, a decarbonization roadmap for the 2020 to 2050 horizon, and a 20212025 Strategic Plan that lays the groundwork for the transition starting in the short term and moving forward.\n\n## 8.1.3. Strategy\n\nRepsol supports the Paris Agreement and works to play an active role in the solution to climate change. The Company's commitment to energy transition is in line with the objectives of the Paris Summit and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIn December 2019, Repsol publicly announced plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, making it the first company from its industry to set itself the ambitious goal of limiting global warming remains to below 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels.\n\nTo achieve this transition, a holistic approach is needed, involving analysis of future scenarios, identification of risks and opportunities associated with climate change, and development of a strategy aligned with the transition to a low-carbon economy. This requires taking into account all available and emerging technologies, their costs and the degree of maturity, while maintaining technological neutrality.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nTo set out the roadmap for how business should evolve by 2050 the SDS (Sustainable Development Scenario) of the International Energy Agency has been taken as a reference point for the projections on energy demand and several scenarios have been analyzed to assess the impact on the Company's strategic lines and competitiveness. The aim is to anticipate how Repsol will adapt in order to sustainably provide the energy that society will need in future and meet the ambition of becoming a netzero emissions company by 2050.\n\nRepsol's international status has also been taken into account in defining these scenarios, as the Company's business is not distributed evenly across all regions of the world. The Downstream business is located mainly in Europe, where climate policies and regulations are currently more ambitious than in the rest of the world. Upstream, meanwhile, is a global activity and is present on all continents. Of Repsol's total GHG inventory, 56% is located in Europe and is subject to EU policies and regulations, notably: the EU Green Deal, the EUETS, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). Their impact is analyzed through the Integrated R isk Management System and taken into account when shaping the Company's strategy.\n\nOn such bases and in an integrated manner for the Company, different scenarios have been proposed: Central, Deep Oil Decarbonization, Electro and Hydrogen.\n\nThe Company's baseline scenario is the Central scenario, from which it will achieve the target of becoming a net zero emissions company by 2050. This scenario plots out the decarbonization roadmap from now through to 2050, with levers that the Company believes can be implemented with a relatively high degree of confidence through to 2030 and with a reasonably degree of confidence through to 2050.",

They are essentially variations of the Central scenario and contemplate varying degrees of performance and levels of penetration of the technologies needed to achieve the long-term objectives.\n\nThe long-term horizon, beyond 2030, comes with a certain measure of technological uncertainty, considering that renewable hydrogen, synthetic fuels, sustainable biofuels or carbon capture, use and storage projects are being developed with differing degrees of intensity, reaching energy sectors where electrification cannot reach and shaping a hybrid energy basket of renewable electricity and low-carbon liquid and gaseous fuels. The energy demand projections under the SDS scenario are used as a benchmark in drawing up the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan and the Company's longterm vision, which was presented to the market and investors in the second half of 2020 ( see Section 3.

        "page_content": "## Decarbonization roadmap\n\nIn the Central scenario, five decarbonization levers clearly appear on the 2020-2030 horizon:\n\n- \u00b7 E/uniFB03ciency , driving the decarbonization of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the assets we operate. It entails a continuous process of searching for opportunities in the fields of technology, design and operation and maintenance procedures, focusing on the following areas:\n- -  Energy efficiency and electrification of energy consumption.\n- -  Reducing methane emissions and routine flaring emissions.\n- \u00b7 Transforming the Upstream portfolio to prioritize assets that have a shorter life cycle and are less carbon intensive.\n\n## \u00b7 Low carbon fuels and circular economy\n\n.\n\n- Advanced biofuels, biogas from organic waste and incipient synthetic fuels are key to the decarbonization of the Company's refineries and chemical complexes. Repsol will have a production capacity of 1.3 million metric tons of sustainable biofuels by 2025 and more than 2 million metric tons by 2030.\n\nThe Company will also focus on the production of renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis and biogas. Repsol has set itself a target of producing renewable hydrogen equivalent to 0.4 GW by 2025, with the aim of reaching 1.2 GW by 2030.\n\nAs an integrated energy company, Repsol actively implements the circular economy in all countries in which it operates and across its entire value chain, from the procurement of raw materials through to the marketing and sale of products and services. Repsol is in the efficient products business, meaning it is geared toward the circular economy and the production of advanced biofuels. Biogas is a prime example of this. It has also set itself the target of recycling the equivalent of 10% of total polyolefin production by 2025 and 20% by 2030 ( for more information, see Section 8.3. Technology and digitalization ).\n\n- \u00b7 Low-carbon electricity generation Repsol has set itself the target of reaching 7,500 MW of low-emission electrical power generation capacity by 2025 , rising to 15,000 MW by 2030, which it will accomplish by investing in wind and solar power generation. It currently has a total installed low-carbon generation capacity of 3,295 MW and a further 2,639 MW\n\nunder development. For further information, see Section 7.3.4 Electricity and Gas.\n\n- \u00b7 CO2 capture and storage . Carbon capture, use and storage technologies play a key role in Repsol's decarbonization strategy. As we move a little further into the twenties, Repsol is already involved in developing these technologies as a member of the OGCI Climate Investments fund. Repsol also has plans to undertake a CCS project in Indonesia, at the Sakakemang natural gas discovery, to capture an estimated 1.6 MtCO2/year at its facilities.\n- A CO2 capture project is also planned at the Petronor refinery for the production of synthetic fuels.\n\nAside from the five decarbonization levers described above, Repsol promotes other initiatives - albeit with less of an impact in the period-  to raise awareness among customers of the cost of reducing Scope 3 emissions through carbon offsetting mechanisms based on natural climate solutions, as well as the stake held by Repsol Foundation in Sylvestris, a company specialized in CO2 absorption projects through large-scale reforestation.\n\nRepsol Foundation has the company Repsol Impacto Social (Repsol Social Impact) to invest in companies that work toward the energy transition and generate social development. One of its main courses of action is to reduce emissions through the stake it holds in Sylvestris, a company specialized in reforestation to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Repsol Foundation, the Sylvestris group and Land Life have now laid the foundations for creating a leading joint venture within the sector, which will undertake projects to offset emissions through large-scale reforestation in Spain, Portugal and Latin America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRepsol currently offers its fuel customers the NetZero Emissions Commitment program to allow for voluntary offsetting of emissions every time they fill up the vehicle. The initiative is available for payments made through Repsol's mobile app, Waylet. Repsol customers can offset the CO2 emissions from their fuel consumption by supporting forestry projects. It is voluntary and every time the customer decides to offset, Repsol matches the amount.\n\n<!-- image -->",

NCSs encompass changes in land use and management that can effectively reduce GHG emissions and increase CO2 absorption by creating and expanding natural sinks. These actions also support biodiversity, improve water quality and quantity and aid in the social development of local communities. Aside from its participation in Sylvestris - the JV for reforestation projects-  and the Waylet carbon offset initiative, as a member of the OGCI Repsol is involved in the NCS Alliance initiative, led by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nUnder its Central scenario and assuming that the prevailing macro environment is consistent with the scenarios analyzed, Repsol estimates an 80% reduction in the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), driven by an increase in renewable electricity generation, the penetration of low-carbon liquid\n\nand gaseous fuels and the application of CCUS. In tandem, and as energy mix continues to evolve, the Company's hydrocarbon production will be pared back from 2030 onwards. In the same macro environment as the IEA's SDS scenario, Repsol visualizes the alternative scenarios described above, in which certain technologies witness accelerated development.\n\n- \u00b7 Deep oil decarbonization: This scenario envisions greater electrification with respect to the Central scenario for light transport, while heavy, maritime and aviation must rely more heavily on low-carbon fuels.\n- \u00b7 Electro: This scenario contemplates even further progress in the electrification of the transport sector through heavy reliance on the development of fuel cells. Road transport is electrified beyond just light vehicles. Advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels continue to meet the demands of the  transport industry, in areas where electrification cannot reach.\n- \u00b7 Hydrogen: This scenario envisions a higher penetration of this energy vector in transport and for industrial end-uses, partially displacing natural gas.\n\nThe contribution that each of the drivers defined in Repsol's decarbonization roadmap effectively makes depends on the alternative scenario analysed throughout the 2030-2050 period.

Repsol has set an internal carbon price that applies to all investment decisions on new projects, except where there is a climate regulation that already provides carbon incentives and provided that it is higher than the internal price. This price has been set at 40 dollars/metric ton of CO2 in 2025.\n\nOver the course of the year, Repsol developed its own analysis methodology to gauge whether an investment is aligned and compatible with the Company's decarbonization roadmap.\n\nEvery investment proposal submitted to the Executive Committee must include a report drawn up by the Sustainability Department, describing the impact that the investment will have on the Company's Carbon Intensity Indicator.\n\nAn investment will qualify as Paris Compliant if it does not modify the CII Base Case or improves upon it and brings the Company closer to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAn investment that does not strictly qualify as Paris Compliant may qualify as an Energy Transition Enabler if it negatively impacts the CII by no more than 1% and the Company will offset the impact through other initiatives so as not to affect the global decarbonization roadmap.\n\nElsewhere, Repsol strongly supports the use of financing as an instrument to promote sustainability and accelerate the energy transition. The Company is working on monitoring the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance so that it is inclusive with technological neutrality, progressive, and ultimately allows for a cost-efficient and sustainable energy transition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Technology and Corporate Venturing Units contribute to the Company's strategy by investing in low-emission technologies. ( for more information, see Section 8.3. Technologies for decarbonization )\n\n## Resilience of the strategy\n\nRepsol has conducted a risk analysis of the decarbonization roadmap to 2050 in order to estimate the degree of uncertainty associated with the achievement of net-zero emissions target (in place for Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and the potential economic impact that the energy transition may have on the Company. The following assumptions have been tested:\n\n- \u00b7  Unit cost of each metric ton of CO2e emitted in excess of the emission reduction pathway for each simulated scenario.\n- \u00b7  Abatement cost of the decarbonization pathway drivers and the Company's ability to unlock these drivers (total CAPEX limit and unit investment rate).\n\nBased on these assumptions, there is a 75% probability that the economic impact of the risks associated with the energy transition will not exceed a decline in projected 2025 EBITDA of 3% by 2040 and of 8% by 2050.\n\nGiven these findings, Repsol firmly believes that its strategy, portfolio and financial framework lay the foundations for the Company's resilience by providing the adaptability and flexibility needed for future changes in the energy system on the longterm horizon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reviewing Repsol's involvement in initiatives and associations within the industry: Climate change\n\nIn line with its commitment to the fight against climate change and the decarbonization of the economy, Repsol works to ensure that all the associations and initiatives in which we take part are aligned both with the fulfillment of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and with the Company's main courses of action in the realm of climate change. Repsol selects associations and initiatives that are closely related to the energy sector, operate in regions or countries in which we have significant business or commercial activities and important in the fight against climate change.",

To help monitor this process, the Company has set itself intermediate reduction targets (compared to base year 2016) of 12% by 2025, 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.\n\nBy 2050, Repsol estimates that at least 80% of the CII can be achieved through the technological progress we currently envision for the future. It is committed to applying the best technologies available at that time to raise this figure, including carbon capture, use and storage and, if this falls short, it will offset emissions through reforestation and other natural climate solutions.\n\n%\n\n%\n\n-70\n\n-80\n\n%\n\n%\n\n-90\n\n-100\n\n2020\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n2035\n\n2040\n\n2045\n\n2050\n\n## Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) reduction targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2025\n\n%\n\n10\n\n2030\n\n%\n\n20\n\n%\n\n-50\n\n2040\n\n%\n\n40\n\n%\n\n-100\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0",

This is well above target, mainly due to quieter levels of business activity amid the pandemic. The Company estimates that the final value would have been around 3.7%, based on levels of activity prior to the pandemic. This improvement is down to the implementation of energy efficiency and methane emissions management plans, the increasing presence of biofuels in petrol and diesel products, and the contribution made by the lowemission electricity business.\n\nThe numerator of the CII shows the emissions generated by the Company's activities (direct and indirect emissions derived from Upstream activities (exploration and production), refining and chemicals operations and from the generation of electrical power), as well as emissions generated by the use of fuel products derived from our primary energy production (oil and natural gas). Meanwhile, the denominator shows the energy that Repsol makes available to society in the form of end products\n\nderived from the production of primary energy from oil and gas and from low-carbon energy sources. (For more information, click here: https://www. repsol.com/imagenes/global/en/carbon\\_intensity\\_ indicator\\_tcm14-198668.pdf).\n\n## CO2 equivalent emission reduction plans\n\nRepsol has established emission reduction plans (Scopes 1 and 2) to reduce energy and carbon intensity through operational efficiency measures. These plans led to a reduction of 5.5 million tons over the period spanning 2006 to 2020. During the year, the Company successfully completed its 20142020 reduction plan, thus achieving a reduction of 2.4 Mt CO2e above and beyond the target of 2.1. It also defined a new plan for the 2021-2025 horizon in a bid to achieve a further reduction of 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 by 2025, including, among others measures, electrification projects, the energy integration of units, process optimization and efficient operation of plants and facilities. In energy terms, a reduction of 7.3 million GJ was achieved in 2020, yielding a cumulative reduction of 37.8 million GJ over the entire period.\n\n## CO 2 e emission reduction (millions of tons)\n\nMt CO2e reduced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-7",

        "page_content": "## Reduction of methane emissions intensity\n\nConvinced of the importance of the role of natural gas in the energy transition, Repsol has taken on the specific goal of reducing the intensity of methane emissions in its operated assets by 25% in 2025 compared to 2017 (1.34%). For 2030 it has assumed a new concrete target of reaching a methane intensity of 0.2%, a value recognized as close to zero intensity for the O&G industry and which is also consistent with the target recently announced by the OGCI (Oil and Gas Climate Initiative), of which Repsol is a member.\n\nIn 2020, the methane intensity value was particularly low, even below the 2025 target, due to the operational impact of the pandemic. Estimates have been made, and this value would be at least 1.03% if we factor in certain operational normalization factors.\n\n| Methane intensity (1)          |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CH4 emissions/gas produced (%) |   0.98 |   1.28 |   1.17 |\n\n## Reduction of flared gas\n\nIn June 2016, Repsol joined the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative of the World Bank, in pursuit of technically and economically feasible solutions to minimize routine flaring as soon as possible and by no later than 2030 at its Upstream facilities.\n\nSince then, work has been done to improve the inventory of emissions due to gas flaring year by year, segregating this inventory into routine and nonroutine flaring, applying the definitions of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction initiative of the World Bank and ensuring a standard approach to the process among OGCI companies.\n\nRepsol established a target of achieving a 50% reduction in CO2e emissions from routine flaring activity by 2025, in relation to E&P operated assets and with 2018 as the base year.\n\nIn 2020, routine flaring emissions were up due to increased production at the most flaring intensive assets and the improvements made to make the measurement methodology more precise. Overall this led to a 52% increase in emissions from routine flaring in respect of the base year (2018).\n\nThis increase will not undermine progress toward the 2025 target, as key reduction actions have been envisioned to minimize flaring at the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Transition Principles\n\nRepsol takes part in the Energy Transition Principles initiative alongside seven leading companies from the energy sector. Within this framework, six principles have been developed and agreed upon to become the common pillars of action for the energy transition and to respond to investor and stakeholder demand for greater consistency and transparency in measuring and reporting progress on decarbonization.\n\n| Routine gas flaring                |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| kt CO2for Upstream routine flaring |    524 |    280 |\n\n## 8.2. Environment 1\n\nRepsol runs its business by prioritizing actions needed to minimize any potential environmental impact. To achieve this, it optimizes water management, minimizes air emissions and implements the principles of the waste management hierarchy to minimize waste and, where not possible, to give it a second life as part of own processes or third-party processes. The conservation of natural capital, biodiversity and the circular economy are key aspects in the development of Repsol's Sustainability Model. The Company relies on a multi-disciplinary team of professionals and is actively involved in industry working groups, taskforces and alliances such as IPIECA, CONCAWE and IOGP.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2.1. Natural capital and biodiversity\n\n## Focus on natural capital in decision making\n\nNatural capital is the stock of natural resources which, through the ecosystem services it provides, contributes directly or indirectly to the well-being of people, the development of society and the global economy. Companies like Repsol depends on natural capital and their operations generate impacts on it.\n\nHuman activities focused on economic development must successfully overcome the challenge of minimizing the natural capital lost through such activities. Conservation and protection is a key factor in achieving sustainable development.\n\nOn this front, the Company is developing a natural capital approach to decision-making to safeguard the benefits provided by ecosystems for present and future generations. By viewing ecosystems in general and biodiversity in particular as capital, we can appreciate their value and worth and account for them in a way that enables management decisions based on a suitable balance between costs and benefits.\n\nRepsol has developed a methodology known as the Global Environmental Management Index(GEMI), together with a related digital tool to allow for a comprehensive appraisal of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management of natural capital at Block 57 (Peru)\n\nIn 2020, Repsol conducted various natural capital analyses at Block 57, enabling us to understand and assess both the impacts and the mitigation measures put in place in terms of the ecosystem services on which the local communities living within the concession rely. In carrying out these analyses, Repsol applied the GEMI (Global Environmental Management Index) methodology. The main findings have been included in the Biodiversity Guidance to the Natural Capital Protocol. 1\n\nGood biodiversity impact mitigation practices implemented and analyzed with GEMI include the rescue and relocation of orchids, bromeliads and sensitive flora; control of exotic species; protection of sensitive trees, seed trees, vulnerable wildlife and areas of importance to them; maintenance of forest connectivity through canopy bridges and re-injection of drilling waste to reduce environmental contamination. The e/ffective implementation of these management practices will reduce the impact of the pipeline and drilling rigs required for the Sagari project by 55% compared with a baseline scenario with no mitigation measures. This will prevent a loss of ecosystem services worth 8.5 million US dollars over a 20-year period.\n\nenvironmental impacts and dependencies of both projects and operations on a global scale: Repsol Environmental Analytics Data System (READS) .\n\nGEMI analyzes the relationship between the components of natural capital (plants, animals, air, water, etc.) and the ecosystem services they provide on one side, and Repsol activities on the other. This relationship is measured in two ways: 1) in economic terms, enabling the effects of each activity to be measured on the same scale; and 2) in dimensionless impact units that take into account of specific site conditions, thus making it possible to optimize environmental management at local level.\n\nThis methodology has been recognized by the experts at the Capitals Coalition 1 and the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), thanks to its scientific robustness and because it is aligned with the Natural Capital Protocol and the Biodiversity Guidance 2 . The methodology is a sign of Repsol's commitment to the principles enshrined in the Natural Capital Protocol for measuring and assessing the impacts and dependencies of the Group's operations.\n\n## Embracing respect for biodiversity in our operations\n\nBiodiversity is one of the main components of natural capital. It is a far-reaching concept that embraces not only ecosystems and their living components, but also the ecological processes that sustain them and the valuable services that these processes provide and on which we all depend.\n\nThe latest reports of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) show that biodiversity has continued to decline across all regions of the world 3 , meaning therefore, it is now more important than ever to roll out measures that prevent this.\n\nAs part of its mission of being an energy company that is firmly committed to a sustainable world, Repsol has pledged to mitigate impacts on biodiversity and all the resources it offers when planning and developing projects and operations, no matter where they are located.",

        "page_content": "Repsol has a set of internal environmental management regulations for carrying out these practices, which include Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessments (ESHIA) for all new operations or facilities, even when this is not a local legal requirement. These studies ensure that all potential impacts are identified as early as possible in the project life cycle and are taken into account in the project design so as to prevent and mitigate any negative effects.\n\nThis includes the obligation to determine the sensitivity of the area that the operations will affect and to assess, on a project-by-project basis, whether work should continue in the case of sensitive areas.\n\n## 8.2.2. Water\n\n## Water as a shared resource\n\nWater is a key resource with socio-economic, climate and biodiversity impacts. Therefore, Repsol strongly believes that water must be managed as a strategic resource to ensure the sustainability of its operations. It strives to ensure that water is used as efficiently as possible in collaboration with local stakeholders on the path to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nEnsuring water availability, quality and accessibility is essential to maintain our license to operate, and is one of the main environmental challenges facing the energy sector.\n\nWater at Repsol is used in key processes at industrial facilities, factories, service stations and at Exploration & Production assets.\n\nMost of the water captured by the Company comes from the ocean (83%) and is used in cooling processes. The rest is supplied by third parties (9%), mainly public water network suppliers, surface sources (7%) and groundwater sources (1%).\n\nAside from cooling, water is commonly used for steam generation, as an input for industrial processes, drilling activities and other minor uses such as fire-fighting water or the supply of sanitary services.\n\nIn terms of water discharge, the main destination is the ocean (95.5%), which receives all cooling water used. Other destinations include surface water bodies (3.3%) and delivery to third parties for treatment and/or final disposal (1.2%).\n\nThe main potential impacts derived from water use relate to water withdrawal, which leads to a reduction in water availability and can affect ecosystems and habitats of certain species, and to its discharge into surface water bodies and a reduction in the quality of the water present across ecosystems.\n\n## Fresh water withdrawal by activity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LIFE-DIVAQUA Project\n\nRepsol takes part in the LIFE-DIVAQUA 1 project through its Electricity and Gas business. The main objective of this initiative is to restore and improve the condition of the aquatic ecosystems and habitats of the Natura 2000 network in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain) and surrounding area. The main actions under this project are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Restoring aquatic species and habitats to a good conservation status.\n- \u00b7  Reducing human pressure on biodiversity, thus improving the conservation status of aquatic habitats and species, and enhancing ecosystem services.\n- \u00b7  Fostering the sustainability of productive, educational, cultural and tourism activities.\n- \u00b7  Developing new tools and approaches to improve the characterization, monitoring, assessment and management of species and habitats.",

On 2020, open-circuit cooling water from the Electricity and Gas business, which captures seawater (non-fresh water), has been included within the scope of the water discharged metric.\n\n## Impact management, risk analysis and the Repsol Water Tool (RWT)\n\nRepsol has been managing water at its facilities for decades, appraising risks and impacts and seeking out new solutions at operational level to minimize consumption and preserve water quality.\n\nThe main impacts associated with the use of water in operations stem from the process of extracting the resource from the natural environment and from water discharge activities, which are kept to a bare minimum by complying with applicable legal requirements and internal standards drawn up in line with best international practices established by IOGP, IPIECA and other industry associations to which Repsol belongs.\n\nThe identification of water-related impacts relies on the use of specific tools, including Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessments, which are conducted in accordance with local law and regulations in the countries where Repsol operates or following internal standards, as well as the periodic monitoring requirements agreed upon with the corresponding environmental authorities. Natural capital analyses are also carried out following an internal methodology known as the\n\nGlobal Environmental Management Index (GEMI), of which water management is a key component. Life Cycle Analysis are also run to measure the environmental performance - including the water vector-  of the Company's products. Meanwhile, water footprint studies and other detailed technical analyses are conducted in operations where water management is a priority.\n\nThe Company relies on the Repsol Water Tool (RWT) to analyze the exposure of our operations to the risk of water scarcity. The tool is used to assess both internal risks (measurement quality, types of water use, treatment technologies, etc.) and external risks (water availability, quality and ecosystems that are withdrawal sources or discharge receiving bodies, future water availability, regulatory and business risks, etc.). The tool enables us to identify businesses and facilities where it is necessary to make a greater management effort and the need to act is a priority.\n\nSince 2013, RWT analysis has been carried out at refineries, chemical plants and Upstream assets that account for more than 90% of the fresh water captured by Repsol operations around the world. In 2020, the Company set itself the objective of improving the analysis methodology to incorporate new sources of information and to adapt the analysis to new types of operations.\n\n## Actions for sustainable water management\n\nRepsol pursues various courses of action through for 2025 in relation to water management. They entail a proper analysis of water-related risks, making the real value of this resource part of decisionmaking processes, and nurturing a water culture at the Company.\n\nThe lines of action for water through to 2025 are deployed at the Group's different business units in the form of specific plans and actions that sometimes feature related targets.",

The Company will use this facility to supply some 250,000 metric tons of advanced biofuels per year for aviation and land transport uses, thus enabling a reduction of 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per year.\n\nRepsol is also working to find alternatives to fuels for road transport, as well as for air and maritime transport. Specifically for air transport, the Repsol Technology Lab is developing processes for the production of kerosene from renewable or recycled raw materials, which are then scaled up to industrial production. In 2020, the Company successfully manufactured the first batch of aviation biofuels for the Spanish market . This particular biojet was produced at Puertollano (Ciudad Real) and is being continued at other Repsol industrial complexes in Spain.\n\n## Use of biogas from organic raw materials\n\nThe Company is leading projects in new technologies to obtain renewable gases from waste. A key project here is the future biogas production plant from municipal solid waste in Bilbao . The aim is to use the biogas generated to replace part of the natural gas consumed by the Petronor refinery, thus contributing to decarbonization. The plant will\n\ntransform 10,000 metric tons of waste per year, with a capacity that can be expanded in later phases to up to 100,000 metric tons per year.\n\n## Recycling plastic to produce circular polymers\n\nRepsol is working to recycle the equivalent of 20% of its polyolefin production by 2030. The Company's circular polyolefins can be obtained by replacing part of the conventional raw material used with oil from the chemical recycling of plastic waste that is not suitable for mechanical recycling, which is also carried out at its facilities.\n\n## Production of renewable hydrogen at refineries and petrochemical plants\n\nThe most widespread technology for hydrogen production today is steam reforming from natural gas. The search for solutions to reduce the carbon intensity involved in the production of this hydrogen is one of the key priorities of Repsol's Technology area. The Company is currently pursuing various projects in relation to the generation and use of renewable hydrogen with a low carbon footprint, notably the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Production of renewable hydrogen through electrolysis at the Bilbao refinery.\n- \u00b7  Development, alongside Enag\u00e1s, of a new technology for the production of hydrogen through photoelectrocatalysis using solar radiation.\n\n## Biogas production plant from municipal solid waste\n\n<!-- image -->",

The facility will be built at the Port of Bilbao (Spain), close to the Petronor refinery. These new fuels will be produced with water (hydrogen precursor) and CO2 as the only raw materials, and can be used both for mobility and in the residential sector.\n\nIt will also enable the direct use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by powering new hydrogen fleets and vehicles.\n\n## Development of low carbon footprint fuels in all fields of mobility, including top-flight competition\n\nDeveloping fuels with a high renewable content is one of the cornerstones of Repsol's decarbonization roadmap. The Company currently uses biofuels in blends with mineral fuels, diesel and gasoline, in compliance with European regulations on the use of energy from renewable sources in transport. Adding these biofuels to conventional fuels in higher proportions is a technological challenge.\n\nRepsol's Technology Lab is therefore working on the development, demonstration and scaling of products with low or zero carbon emissions. To achieve this, a roadmap has been drawn up to develop low or zero carbon fuels for different road transport segments, including service stations, vehicle fleets and even motor racing. The plan is therefore to develop gasolines and diesel fuels with carbon footprint reduction potentials ranging from 50% to negative footprint.\n\n## CCUS\n\nTo develop carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies, the Company works alongside its partners on the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) through the Climate Investment fund. This organization brings together 12 large companies from the Oil & Gas sector and its fund invests in decarbonization technologies. In the realm of CCUS, highlights include the investment made in Canadian company Svante , which has developed a CO2 capture technology with the potential to halve the costs of other current techniques through the use of nano-adsorbents.\n\nRepsol is also appraising CCS opportunities at its E&P assets with the scientific support of the Repsol Technology Lab. As a result of this assessment, the Company has launched the Sakakemang project in\n\nIndonesia, a pioneering initiative for the Group in , with a potential of\n\nthe capture and storage of CO2 1.6 Mt/year of CO2.\n\nThe captured CO2 can be geologically stored or used as a raw material for a wide range of applications. Repsol Technology Lab is also developing tech to convert captured CO2 into raw materials for a broad spectrum of products, from the synthesis of polymers and the production of synthetic fuels to their eventual incorporation into construction materials, among others. OGCI also supports cutting-edge companies in this realm, including Solidia , which uses CO2 to manufacture concrete.\n\n## Distributed generation and grids\n\nRepsol is working to develop the following technologies to incorporate integrated solutions based on artificial intelligence that will increase the energy efficiency and flexibility of electricity grids:\n\n- a) Energy management systems (EMS), which lower electricity consumption and optimize the operating regimes for various electrical applications.\n- b) Virtual Assets Management (VAM) systems to aggregate distributed generation sources and demand within a territory, enabling the secure and stable operation of the electricity system.\n\n## 8.3.2. Repsol Corporate Venturing\n\nRepsol's objective is to accelerate the introduction of innovative technologies and business models, through an investment fund that seeks to acquire stakes in start-ups that offer solutions in three key realms of action: decarbonization and circular economy, advanced mobility and renewable energies, and digital technology and asset optimization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Project to produce hydrogen\n\nDevelopment of photoelectrochemical technology for hydrogen production, in partnership with Enag\u00e1s. This proprietary and disruptive technology splits water into hydrogen and oxygen without the need for any electrical power source, thus enabling the direct transformation of solar energy into chemical energy at ambient pressure and temperature through a single device.\n\nIn November 2020, the first pilot plant started operating on a relevant scale (~1 m 2 per module) at the facilities of Repsol Technology Lab. This pilot is the most ambitious project to date in terms of photoelectrochemical hydrogen production, in terms of size and e/fficiency, while simultaneously overcoming key challenges relating to stability and cost.",

Digitalization\n\nSince its inception in 2017, Repsol's Digitalization Program has remained firmly committed to sustainability through more than 250 digital cases, of which 105 contribute directly to the Company's own sustainable development goals.\n\nThis Horizontal Program seeks to obtain economic benefits along the entire value chain through digital technology drivers such as artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics, robotic process automation (RPA) and omni-channeling.\n\nIn 2020, the Company prioritized the following initiatives to increase safety and operational efficiency and cushion the environmental impact:\n\n- \u00b7  In the field of E&P and with regard to safety at facilities, the Company has opted for digital solutions that feature both physical and logical control barriers, where data can be managed through the graphic representation of risk scenarios (Bow-Tie models). As for reducing the environmental impact, highlights include the Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) methodology for comprehensive natural capital assessment and decisionmaking ( for more information, see Section 8.4 ). Repsol is also working to make the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions part of its Production Management Systems ( PMS ) to standardize the process of calculating and taking inventories of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at assets, as per the standard defined by the Company.\n- \u00b7  In the industrial realm, various Smart Energy Management initiatives are currently being scaled up. These initiatives provide recommendations on how to reduce energy consumption at industrial assets through simulations and machine learning, thus achieving reductions in GHG emissions across the different phases of the production process. Further initiatives include apps which, once installed on a mobile device, allow workers to carry out tasks related to key processes anywhere within the production plant (prioritized management of steam leaks, scheduled checks, plant inspections, spot checks, safety checks, etc.). In relation to safety, Repsol has deployed a smart system known as Asset Health at the five refineries. This system relies on predictive tool maintenance models that integrate a large quantity of plant data with various failure prediction models, showing the user corrosion heat maps and the health of the\n- equipment, thus improving its management and helping to avoid the risk of containment loss.\n- \u00b7  Meanwhile, the Chemicals business has been working to improve the traceability of processes from start to finish, effectively reducing risks in the transport of potentially unstable mixtures and providing predictive models to anticipate possible quality impairment or optimize the operation of production units.\n- \u00b7  At the Trading business, highlights include the implementation of an integrated ship Vetting management system and the automation of the incident management process for vessels. These initiatives have a significant impact on the safety of operations and the management of incidents and emergencies.\n- \u00b7  On the commercial side, progress has been made in the deployment of applications based on sensorization, Artificial Intelligence and Cloud technology. A prime example is the Smart Management of energy, through tools that offer customers recommendations on how to make their home or business more energy efficient. Sensorizing different elements of Service Stations allows us to optimize the management of our assets and improve the customer experience. And in the residential segment, highlights include the development of energy management solutions like Solmatch, which champions the distributed generation of electricity at consumption points through the design of solar communities in urban centers.\n\nThe Company is also promoting the use of the Repsol ARiA Data Analytics Platform, which acts as an enabler of digital products for the different businesses by providing a huge knowledge base in the form of data and analytical models, all hosted in the cloud.\n\nAnother driver of digital transformation that will impact sustainability is the development of robots to ensure safe operation by reducing exposure to employee hazards during routine maintenance work or operations, and keeping the handling of hazardous substances to a bare minimum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGSP\n\n20\n\n20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 Objective:\n\nChampion new digital solutions that will contribute toward e/fficient and sustainable energy generation.\n\nIn 2020 +250 digital initiatives, 105 of them directly impacting sustainability\n\n## External recognition:\n\nRepsol has launched an ambitious digital transformation program that has been making essential contributions to its business model.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Different initiatives have been rolled out through the COVID-19 Coordination and Monitoring Committee, headed by the People and Organization area with members from the Business Units and various Corporate Divisions. The committee is entrusted with the following key tasks:\n\n- \u00b7  Defining prevention measures and protocols to be implemented in the different countries and work centers.\n- \u00b7  Compiling epidemiological data and continuously monitoring and analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on employees.\n- \u00b7  Regularly informing employees about prevention measures, the evolution of the pandemic, solidarity actions, etc.\n\nMeasures in place to ensure health and productivity:\n\n- \u00b7  activating new working shift approaches in the industrial facilities\n- \u00b7  keeping service stations open, based on the safety and service requirements prescribed by the competent authorities\n- \u00b7  ensuring the agile deployment of remote working for employees not working in an industrial site or service station, without impacting  their performance\n- \u00b7  overseeing a safe and orderly return to work, guaranteeing that the biological capacity is not exceeded and providing individual protection measures\n\nThe health crisis has also had a significant impact on labor relations and productivity, as the restrictions have prevented employees to access their work sites. This has called for rapid and urgent digitalization and the need to implement remote working arrangements. In addition, Repsol has been adapting and responding rapidly to the constant legislative and labor regulation changes emerged in the different countries.\n\nIn June, all employees were asked to complete a global survey to find out their views on how the\n\nCOVID-19 crisis was being managed. Notably, the survey revealed widespread satisfaction with the management of the health crisis (82%), along with an improved perception of the Company and a positive assessment of the people management activity carried out over the period.\n\nProtect employment has been a priority  for Repsol within the crisis situation and under the framework of actions to accompany the Resilience Plan of the Company, guaranteeing proper management of the operations as well as productivity, and maintaining personnel costs stable.\n\nAverage staff costs 1 per employee amounted to 69.9 thousand euros in 2020 (72 thousand euros in 2019). Total spending on social benefits has been 103.6 million euros in 2020 (115.6 million euros in 2019), of which 78% took the form of healthcare and pension fund contributions.\n\n## Organizational streamlining and adoption of new ways of working\n\nRepsol is committed to a flatter and more flexible organization to make us more agile and enable more efficient management. It is also seeking to combine on-site and remote work via a digital environment that favors productivity and a healthy work-life balance and is based on trust, collaboration and results-based recognition.\n\nDuring 2020 the Company has continued with the transformation agenda focusing on the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7  Supporting the deployment of transformation processes that have resulted in flatter and more flexible structures and marked an important step toward a new mentality in our approach to work. These processes have impacted 1,282 people and have led to a 72% improvement in the span of control of the transformed areas.\n- \u00b7  Deployment of the Digital Workplace, which defines different actions to promote new ways of working on three fronts: people, workspaces and use of technologies and digitization. The mobilization of a network of drivers of the digital transformation, comprising more than 300 people from different\n- \u00b7  departments and businesses, has been a key element.Training 1,847 people in Agile & Lean methods and practices to instill good behaviors.",

In 2020 remote work requested by employees has increased by 27%.\n\n## Strategic Talent Management\n\nRepsol fosters talent and leadership as strategic drivers, favoring an inspirational and entrepreneurial style of leadership that involves motivational and anticipatory people management.\n\nIn 2020, the Company launched its executive development roadmap, which associates specific development actions for executives according to their career stage. The global Mentoring plan for 2021 has also been approved. Both actions support the Company's new Strategic Plan.\n\nThe launch of the People Analytics practice, which advocates a culture of data-driven decisionmaking, allows for a more strategic form of talent management. This also includes workforce planning ( Delfos ), which, based in businesses forecasting needs and strategic challenges, as well as the context and industry evolution, will enable Repsol to project and anticipate staffing needs, required profiles and future capabilities.\n\nRepsol's development model is based on a new model of generic skills to be applied to recruitment, internal mobility, training and talent assessment processes. These processes have been reviewed and streamlined with the overriding aim of improving the employee and manager experience .\n\nThe Company's transformation has also entailed the need to adapt people to the new profiles and needs of the businesses . In doing so, the Company has relied on mobility where career opportunities have been spotted and on professional reorientation or reskilling programs.\n\nThis year, the prevailing climate has led to an exponential increase in synchronous training (on-line) delivered through virtual spaces , involving the technological adaptation of both learning content and trainers. Repsol has a digital platform where employees can create their own\n\nlearning path and pick their own preferences and hear recommendations. In 2020, participation in online training activities experienced a significant increase, driven by digitalization and the prevailing climate. A significant percentage of the training was focused on learning COVID-19 safety protocols, raising awareness of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, learning about compliance requirements and cybersecurity measures, and developing skills to support the roll-out of the new ways of working, digitalization of the job and remote team management.\n\nFor business units, training has focused on supporting business continuity and deliver specific programs to adapt employees profile to new business needs (reskilling) and strengthening specific skills to create experts and specialists (upskilling).\n\nRepsol is committed to the employability of young talent and has signed scholarship agreements with educational authorities and training centers in Spain to welcome dual vocational training students and interns to our industrial plants, Technology Lab and Campus. In November, for instance, Repsol was an ambassador of European Vocational Skills Week 2020.\n\nWithin the framework of the Employer Branding think tank, Repsol has been recognized by the Webranking by Comprend as having the best Spanish corporate website in 2020, thanks to the way it presents the Company and what working there truly means.\n\nRepsol was also one of only five Spanish companies to make The World's Best Employers 2020 ranking of Forbes USA.\n\nAs stated in its Code of Ethics and Conduct, Repsol is firmly committed to equal opportunities and to diversity and inclusion as differentiating elements on the path to becoming more competitive. These principles will be the product of mutual learning experiences based on the principle of equality and non-discrimination. The Diversity and Work-Life Balance Committee, comprising the by Company's top executives, promotes inclusive diversity whereby employees can unlock their full individual potential.\n\nRepsol is committed to gender equality with the main aim of harnessing all the talent available to be found within society.

The Company improved in inclusive culture, transparency and quality of data and support for female leadership.\n\nIn Spain, Repsol is a benchmark company when it comes to incorporating people with disabilities into the labor market through its responsible purchasing policy, accessibility policy at the work centers, and also through its employability programs. It also aims to broaden the scope of its actions in other countries.\n\nFollowing the accessibility study held at the headquarter offices in 2018 with the aim of diagnosing the level of accessibility of the environment, services and management, a new project, still under implementation, for Campus Accesibility was designed for 2019-2021.\n\nFor the first time at the Company, a framework of action has been created to cover initiatives aimed at the inclusion of the LGTBI group, through the CEO's signing of the Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling Discrimination against LGBTI People , promoted by the United Nations and promulgated in Spain by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Further highlights include the 2020-2025 Sustainability\n\nPlan for communication, awareness-raising and training initiatives to promote an LGTBI-inclusive environment, as well as the creation of the LGTBI Allies group, which in 2020 had around 40 members in Spain, Brazil and the United States, among other regions.\n\nRepsol, in a clear show of its commitment to people, continues to implement flexibility and work-life balance measures in different countries, with the teleworking program being one of the most popular initiatives among employees. In 2020, there was a 27% increase in employees requesting telework to reach 3,847 (2,790 in 2019).\n\nThere are other measures in place such as paid and unpaid leave (prescribed by collective bargaining agreements or by country legislation) and the deployment of different assistance services to help both men and women to work-life balance.\n\nNumerous initiatives are also being developed and informative campaingns are held to reinforce the digital disconnection protocol, signed with trade union representatives and includen in the collective agreements, to encourage a reasonable use of new technologies and to promote a culture that, based on the principle of respect, continues to promote employee well-being.\n\nRepsol is committed to a compensation system that seeks outward co mpetitiveness and internal equity, based on meritocracy, and valuing performance, cooperation and teamwork. The compensation model encompasses fixed pay, an annual bonus, long-term performance-related compensation and benefits, in addition to a flexible remuneration system in some countries that include, for example, the Stock Purchase Plan and other items such as childcare, health insurance and additional contributions to the pension plan.\n\nIn 2020, the Company pegged its variable compensation scheme to the Group's adjusted net profit, balancing this impact accordingly across the various areas and businesses by defining a single Company-wide target. These adjustments to the compensation model are aligned with the 2020 Resilience Plan.\n\nMeanwhile, a stock purchase plan was launched in 2020 for all employees ('Tu Repsol' plan), enabling all workers to become shareholders of the Company under preferential terms and conditions.",

Community Relations and Respect for Human rights 1\n\nThe respect for human rights is a priority for Repsol across all 31 countries where the Group operates, with compliance with the highest international standards. Our respect for human rights is based on two central pillars: political commitment at the top level of the Company and excellent performance in day-to-day operations.\n\nTo ensure this level of performance, Repsol relies on human rights due diligence as the most suitable management model for internal processes, with the aim of identifying, preventing and mitigating the negative impacts of the Company's activities. Besides, the Group's grievance mechanisms help to spot and repair possible violations of human rights.\n\nContinuous improvement of the system is ensured by learning from the di/uniFB00erent phases of the due diligence process and from its grievance mechanisms and by lessons learned from the Company's external and internal partners.\n\n## Due diligence\n\n- \u00b7 Context analysis\n- \u00b7 Risks and impacts management\n- \u00b7 Identification\n- \u00b7 Assessment\n- \u00b7 Mitigation and repair\n- \u00b7 Monitoring\n- \u00b7 Communication of results\n\n## Grievance mechanisms\n\n- \u00b7 Legitimate\n- \u00b7 Accessible\n- \u00b7 Predictable\n- \u00b7 Equitable\n- \u00b7 Transparent\n- \u00b7 Rights-compatible\n- \u00b7 A source of continuous learning\n\nThe Company's purpose is to build and maintain strong relationships, based on recognition, trust, mutual respect and shared value with 100% of the communities within the area of influence of its projects and assets.

It represents the formal commitment of top management and steers the Company's endeavors in this area. While the policy is fundamentally based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, it also complies with other relevant standards, including  the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards and the 10 Principles of the Global Compact.

Repsol actively participate in international initiatives, such as IPIECA, in partnership with other companies in the sector. The corporate and business teams actively participate in the working groups. Notably, Repsol is vice-president of IPIECA's Social Responsibility working group.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the second straight year Repsol comes within the top quartile of companies operating in the extractives sector in the Corporate\n\n## Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) .\n\n## Due diligence management model\n\nHuman rights due diligence lies at the heart of Repsol's management model, which embraces the main international principles in this realm and is deployed in the Group's Community Relations and Human Rights Standard, in force since 2013 with various updates.\n\nThe Company's management model has an anticipatory approach that focuses on identifying\n\nand mitigating the risks and impacts associated with its activities and on seeking out opportunities, with a commitment to prevention and ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders. It is applied throughout all stages of the life cycle, from the prospect analysis of assets to be acquired by the Company to the abandonment phases. This process involves all stakeholders: contractors, partners, employees, etc.\n\nThe due diligence model emphasizes the economic, social and cultural context analysis in the countries in which Repsol operates. This prior analysis allows us to reach a better assessment of the potential impacts and risks and, through constant dialogue, to fulfil our commitment to maximizing the positive effects and minimize or mitigate any negative impacts. This participatory, proactive, constructive and universally accessible dialogue is the basis for building a relationship of trust with communities, sharing the identified impacts and management plans thereof with the local community to ensure total transparency.\n\nThe Social Investment Management Standard approved in 2019 and already in force at the Company consolidates the social investment strategy with the aim of assuring transparency and optimizing the positive impact of our social investment by creating shared value and contributing to sustainable development.",

Before starting a new project or activity, the business units run a preliminary analysis of the social, environmental and health context; legal requirements; identified potential impacts and the vulnerability of the local environment. The social impact assessment takes into account, among other matters, the right to land and its natural resources, the right to a healthy environment and the right to preserve the identity and culture of communities. Besides, Repsol has its own methodology for assessing human rights impacts since 2014.\n\nAll of the impact assessments conducted in 2020 included social and human rights aspects. There were 9 impact assessments conducted in 5 different countries during 2020.\n\nConvention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) governs the Company's actions in the special case of indigenous communities, whether or not this particular convention has been transposed into the national legislation of each country. Repsol recognizes and respects the unique nature of these communities and their right to free, prior and informed consent. Consequently, for each project, the level of consent of the indigenous peoples is evaluated. In any case, after both the potential impacts and the advisability of continuing with the project are assessed, a decision that would be taken by the Company's Executive Committee.\n\n## Operational-level grievance mechanisms\n\nMost concerns, grievances and complaints from the Company's stakeholders relate to impacts of operations on nearby communities. It is therefore essential to have operational-level grievance mechanisms in place that are designed in collaboration with partners and other stakeholders.\n\nThey are processes for voicing and responding to the concerns of the stakeholders affected. Such mechanisms help to reinforce a company's commitment to ensuring respect for human rights and are an essential part of the due diligence process. They also help anticipate and prevent potential negative impacts.\n\nThe nature of such mechanisms close to Repsol operations is special and unique to each setting and context. They are designed on the basis of well-informed participation, following the United Nations model.\n\nTo be considered legitimate, they must cater to the local circumstances, needs and languages of the area, thus making them accessible to all. That leads to an environment of trust and respect that makes it easier for employees, local residents and rights defenders to report complaints or grievances without fear of retaliation. Moreover, these operational mechanisms are no impediment to judicial or extra-judicial proceedings, and nor do they affect the legitimate and peaceful activities of human rights defenders.\n\nIf the operations of the Company or of its partners or contractors do generate a social or environmental impact, Repsol actively cooperates to repair it. Repsol includes human rights clauses in contracts with partners and suppliers, conducts social audits and provides support with awareness-raising activities to ensure due diligence on both human rights and grievance mechanisms.\n\nIn 2020, 72% of all complaints received during the year were resolved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Triple-impact investment: Repsol Social Impact seeks to invest in and grow companies that are focused on energy transition and the inclusion of vulnerable groups in Spain and Portugal.\n\nRepsol Social Impact is wholly owned by the Repsol Foundation.

        "page_content": "The safety management system is designed to meet two complementary objectives: (1) ensure compliance with common company requirements across all operations; and (2) pay particular attention to the diversity of businesses, countries, activities and business relationship models that need to apply those requirements (for more information, see Appendix III - Safe operation ). This management system therefore comprises three core elements:\n\n- \u00b7  A set of internal regulations, fully aligned with the highest international standards and good practices, which sets the requirements for Company operations throughout their life cycle and supports standard safety and environment risk management processes throughout the Group. This set of regulations comprises the HSE Policy and specific regulations for each of the key aspects of safety management: risk management, incidents, transport or asset integrity, among others.\n- \u00b7  A process of regulatory and procedural development to all businesses and assets, which not only ensures compliance with corporate requirements but also encompasses all necessary features arising from the specific nature of each activity, business relation, commercial and trade relations models and specific legal requirements, both national and local.\n- \u00b7  Certification, verification and assurance processes to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of all the above. The Company has adopted the three lines of defense approach. Therefore, all these processes are deployed across all three lines with complementary objectives in sight:\n- \u00b7  Audits to assure the quality of operational processes (e.g. work permits) are run from the first line of defense. This also includes pertinent external certifications 1 and verification in due course (OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001, etc.) at each of the assets.\n- \u00b7  The second line of defense features specific assurance units, which conduct audits that focus on the degree of implementation and compliance with regulations and internal procedures.\n\n- \u00b7  The third line of defense, particularly the Audit division, performs internal audits to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire system, as well as legal compliance. The reinsurers of the assets also conduct external assessments of the safety management system.\n\nThe Company focuses heavily on safety as part of its digital strategy and treats it as area to be developed. Repsol continuously explores and incorporates technologies and tools to reduce people's exposure to risk environments, facilitate the use of mobile apps or enable extensive analysis of available data in operations. Notable examples of these technologies include InWell Center (Integrated Well Center) for drilling activities, which utilizes Digital Twin technology and AI to improve drilling operations at remote locations; Track & Trace, which geolocates product transportation at the Chemicals and LPG businesses; and the implementation of Operational Risk Management platforms at several of the Group's businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the courses of action associated with the 2025 Safety and Environment (SEN) Strategy is now under way. It involves the systematic review of all tools associated with key safety processes (work permits, change management, barrier management or safety training platforms, transport safety, inspections and leak detection, etc.). For each of these processes, the current situation at all of the Company's businesses is analyzed, a survey of available automation and digital technologies is carried out, and the need to adapt existing tools and incorporate new technologies is assessed.\n\nRepsol representatives are actively involved in the main trade associations on safety matters, such as IPSG (International Process Safety Group), IOGP (International Oil & Gas Producers) and CCPS (Center for Chemical Process Safety). This type of collaboration results in sectoral best practice manuals and guides, which are sponsored by these organizations and subsequently applied across the wider industry. In 2020, these mutual efforts focused on defining mechanisms to learn from normal operations, on analyzing the human element as a barrier, and on how to convert the lessons learned from public inquiries into actual company practices. A particular highlight here is Repsol's involvement in building a Process Safety Incident Database (PSID), whereby participating CCPS members can share their experiences and learn from one another.",

Process safety\n\nRepsol continues to deploy the Key Action Lines set out in its 2025 Safety and Environment Strategy, with actions spanning all aspects of safety management: people, facilities and processes.\n\nIn relation to the key line of process safety, Repsol has flagged operational excellence as one of the cornerstones that will enable it to achieve the goals envisioned in the Strategy. To achieve this, Repsol has been working to design, implement, manage and maintain safety barriers and critical processes to ensure the integrity of its facilities. International standards such as API, NFPA, ISO, EN, IEC, IOGP or CCPS are applied.\n\nRepsol runs inspection and preventive maintenance programs to check the correct functioning of safetycritical systems and equipment. These programs are part of the Company's tools that help improve and reduce the industrial accident rate at its assets.\n\nAlthough 2019 culminated in the completion of the task of reviewing and streamlining all corporate regulations, thus completing the Company's set of safety regulations and covering all essential aspects, these rules and regulations are continually being updated. A prime example of this is the work carried out in 2020 to review the corporate regulations governing safety and environmental risk management throughout the life cycle of the Company's activities. These regulations set tolerable risk limits for business continuity and the review process prompted the Company to add further rules to regulate its new businesses and to extend the scope of the mandatory risk assessment studies.\n\nProcess safety is managed by monitoring key performance indicators that are aligned with the main international benchmarks (IOGP, API and CCPS). In 2020, the process safety indicator has increased by 13% over the previous year, although the result is below the 2020 target. The value of the indicator is in asymptotic values since 2016. Thus, the number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 incidents decreased compared to 2019, by 29% and 6%, respectively, and there was a drop in activity of 23%, which has COVID-19 as its main cause.\n\n| Process safety indicator (1)   |   2020 | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| PSIR (2)  TIER 1 + TIER 2      |   0.62 | 0. 55  |\n\n- (1)  A process safety accident is one in which the first line of control has been breached, with the following happening simultaneously: i) There is a process or a chemical involved ii) It occurs at a specific location, i.e. at a facility used for production, distribution, storage, auxiliary services (utilities) or pilot plants related to the chemical process or product involved and iii) It gives rise to an unplanned or uncontrolled release of material, including non-toxic and non-flammable matter (e.g. steam, hot water, nitrogen, compressed CO 2 or compressed air, with certain levels of consequences. The process safety accident will be classified as Tier 1 or Tier 2, according to the defined thresholds.\n- (2)   PSIR: Process safety incident rate . Number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety accidents per million process hours worked.\n\n## 8.5.3.

The first was an eight metric ton spill of untreated production water in Canada, while the second was a 6 metric ton spill of production fluid at Eagle Ford. Appropriate measures were taken for the remediation of the affected area in all cases.\n\nIf a spill occurs in spite of all the preventive measures put in place, early detection and minimization of the impact on people and the environment becomes a priority. The Company has the necessary human and technical resources. Once the spill has been brought under control and the damages have been  remedied, further preventive actions are put in place to avoid any recurrence.\n\nIn the event of marine spills, and in addition to its own response resources, Repsol has contracts in effect with the world's leading companies to assure a swift response by external specialists and equipment (Oil Spills Response Limited - OSRL, including access to the Global Dispersants stockpile, Wild Well Control, Helix, etc.).",

The Company works in reducing personnel accident rates alongside the most affected stakeholders: employees, contractor and suppliers (for more information, see Appendix III Safe operation ).\n\n| Main personnel safety indicators (1)      | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIF)  (2)         | 0.81    | 0.86    |\n| Lost Time Injury Rate for employees       | 0.71    | 0.79    |\n| Lost Time Injury Rate for contractors     | 0.92    | 0.91    |\n| Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) (3) | 1.11    | 1.24    |\n| TRIR for employees                        | 0.85    | 1.02    |\n| TRIR for contractors                      | 1.40    | 1.42    |\n| No. of employee fatalities                | 0       | 0       |\n| No. of contractor fatalities              | 0       | 1       |\n| Number of safety training hours           | 287,452 | 260,872 |\n\nRepsol has a corporate standard that sets out a standard methodology for logging and managing incidents, improvement actions and lessons learned at the Company. All employees are required to report any incident they encounter or witness. All such incidents must be recorded in the corporate tool and an inquiry process is then opened to identify the root causes, propose improvement actions and lessons learned. This standard extends to 100% of the companies in which Repsol has a majority stake or control of operation. Incidents affecting contractors that provide their services under a direct contract are also recorded.\n\nThe Company has set targets for reducing TRIR since 2014.\n\nIn 2020, the TRIR indicator was down 10% on 2019, as the number of incidents counted in this indicator fell by 24%. Hours worked were down 16% versus 2019 hours due to the impact of Covid 19. The greatest impact is observed in the period that includes the most severe period of the pandemic (January to June) and the summer period, with a 53% decrase in these incidentes compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nAt Repsol, occupational safety indicators are reported in accordance with the internal Incident Management Regulation, which is based on\n\ninternational standards (IOGP and OSHA). Incidents are classified according to the severity of both their actual and potential consequences.\n\n| Ocuppational safety                       | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| acording to severity  of consequences (1) | Men    | Women  | Total  | Total  |\n| Very serious                              | 0      | 0      | 0      | 1      |\n| Serious                                   | 2      | 0      | 2      | 1      |\n| Moderate                                  | 57     | 11     | 68     | 80     |\n| Minor                                     | 20     | 3      | 23     | 41     |\n| Trivial                                   | 2      | 1      | 3      | 4      |\n| OVERALL TOTAL                             | 81     | 15     | 96     | 127    |\n\nTo minimize the risks that can cause harm to the people involved in Group operations, the Company has established 10 Basic Safety Rules. These rules are mandatory for all employees and contractors, and represent a commitment by the Company to provide our people with the necessary tools to reduce exposure to risks when performing their work.\n\n## 8.5.5. Safety culture\n\nContinuous improvement in Safety Culture is a key element in preventing major accidents and in achieving the target of ensuring \"zero accidents\". Therefore, the Company continues to deploy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sca/ffolding safety improvements\n\nWorking at heights is one of the 10 basic safety rules put in place by Repsol to promote a safe working environment when carrying out its activities. This particular rule insists on the use of approved sca/ffolding, platforms and ladders, among other requirements.\n\nOver the past two years, the Engineering Division has led a project to detect possible safety weaknesses in the design, assembly and use of sca/ffolding used at the Company's facilities. The main manufacturers and assemblers working for Repsol have been involved in this process.\n\nDuring this time, specific risk analyses have been carried out jointly, as a result of which corrective measures have been identified and implemented to prevent incidents from occurring. These measures a/ffect the design of the equipment and have been validated by the construction area attached to the Engineering Division and are now in the process of being developed and produced by the manufacturers; and also the development and updating of assembly instructions and related training processes, which the manufacturers themselves will provide to the personnel of the assembly companies.\n\nThis initiative is a clear example of Repsol's teamwork with contractors and in this regard the Company has played a central role as a promoter and catalyst of a safety improvement project, with a clear e/ffect both on and o/ff the Company's facilities.",

        "page_content": "specific safety culture diagnostics across all its different assets and businesses. Since the program's inception in 2015, more than 20 safety culture diagnostics have been carried out at different businesses of the Company. More precisely, in 2020, the areas of Supply and Distribution Peru, the Network of Licensed Service Stations in Spain and the Marcellus business unit in North America in the Upstream business were all diagnosed. In addition, diagnostics are currently under way at Eagle Ford (United States) and Canada, both in the Upstream business.\n\nThese diagnostics will generate aggregated information at company level and at the same time lead to the implementation of specific improvement actions at the diagnosed asset or business. These findings can then be used to identify common weaknesses and improve the way they are managed.\n\nA prime example of this is where the Company identifies the need to train key personnel, focusing on the need to consider human and organizational factors in security-related processes (e.g. incident investigations or design of critical procedures and tasks). The following line of action is therefore being pursued to identify and train these key personnel:\n\n- \u00b7  Incorporation of Human Factor Analysis Tools (HFAT). In 2020, 23 experts received training and therefore already have new skills in how to make the human factor part of the investigation process.\n- \u00b7  Agreement with the EI/CIEHF (Energy Institute / Chartered Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors) to certify qualifying technicians as human factor specialists. So far, 300 licenses have been arranged for the introductory course titled \"Human Performance for All\". Some of these technicians will continue their training until they are certified as specialists.\n\nIn the firm belief that leaders have a key role to play in the positive evolution of the Safety Culture, an ambitious global training program known as \"Safety Leap\" was launched in 2019. Despite the difficulties caused by the pandemic and the impossibility of holding face-to-face training events, the initial phase of the program was successfully completed in 2020, covering a group of more than 2,300 people (99.4% of the total number of leaders at the Company). To achieve this result, it was necessary to deploy virtual training sessions that faithfully reproduce the participant's experience. A total of 112 sessions were held during the period (91 face-to-face and\n\n21 virtual), with editions held in 16 countries and a satisfaction rate of 4.64 out of 5.\n\nThe success of the program has prompted Repsol to extend its scope to other segments within the organization and to create a shortened online version available to all employees. Work has also been carried out to create bespoke versions for the different businesses.\n\n## 8.5.6. Emergencies and crisis management\n\nThe Company does its utmost to prevent accidents, as described above. However, it must be prepared in the event that such incidents actually occur. Therefore, in addition to its prevention activities, the Company works on mechanisms to enable early detection and rapid, effective management of emergency situations.\n\nRepsol continues to make progress in deploying and improving a comprehensive emergency and crisis response model that encompasses industry best practices and involves emergency management at facilities, businesses and senior management for the most serious cases, with specific support teams in place to ensure that the incidents are prioritized accordingly in each case and 24x7 coverage, if necessary.\n\nThe operation of this model is supported through the internal Standard on Crisis and Emergency Management, which requires frequent training activities, drills and exercises at all levels, including at least one annual crisis management drill at the highest level of the Company. Repsol has resources, technology and departments that are dedicated to crisis management support and training at its headquarters and at its offices in the various countries in which it operates.\n\nThe development of crisis response plans has proved to be invaluable in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, through the various methodologies and tools put in place and through the lessons learned during crisis management drills and exercises. They have also revealed new approaches and future courses of action that can be undertaken to ensure the continuous improvement of the Crisis and Emergency Response model. Although it has not been possible to have teams such as the Support Group meet face-to-face in the emergency and crisis response rooms, remote training activities and drills have been carried out to improve the remote management of crisis situations.",

For further information, see www.bteam.org).

For further information, see www.repsol.com\n- (3) International Compliance Assurance Programme: OECD initiative that seeks to enhance cooperation between the tax authorities to supervise tax risks at multinational groups, mainly in terms of transparency and permanent establishments. The first ICAP program (pilot) covered financial year 2016 and lasted until 2018. The tax authorities of Spain, the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all supervise Repsol.\n- (4)  Repsol is a member of several of the subcommittees created by the UN's Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters. Repsol also sits on the tax committee of the OECD's Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC).\n- (5)  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative: initiative that seeks to ensure transparency within extractive industries. The EITI is the global standard for the good governance of oil, gas and mining resources. It ensures transparency with respect to how a country's natural resources are governed.\n\n## Presence in non-cooperative jurisdictions\n\nRepsol is firmly committed to having no presence in non-cooperative jurisdictions, except for legitimate business reasons. Repsol's presence in these territories is immaterial (revenues accounting for less than 0.02% of the Group's turnover) and is not intended to hide its business activities or make them less transparent.\n\nAs part of its commitment to transparency, Repsol releases detailed information on its presence and activities not only in tax havens and noncooperative tax jurisdictions, but also in other territories considered contentious for tax purposes by civil organizations, even though they may not be included on official lists.

The Company's compliance function reinforces compliance culture across the Group and improves our ability to identify ethics and compliance risks. We focus especially on anti-corruption measures, money laundering and terrorist financing prevention, crime prevention, international sanctions, antitrust rules and personal data protection.\n\n## Ethics and Conduct Code\n\nRepsol's Code of Ethics and Conduct is approved by the Board, and applies to all Repsol directors, executive  and employees, whatever the nature of their contractual relationship with Repsol. Our business partners, including non-operated joint ventures, contractors, suppliers and other third parties are an extension of Repsol, and for this reason they should act consistently with our Code, as well as any applicable contractual provisions, when working on our behalf or in collaboration with us. These business partners are also encouraged to develop and implement ethics programs that are consistent with our standards. The Code creates a frame of reference for understanding and putting\n\ninto practice the Company's expectations as to each person's behavior, in light of the Group's principles of action.\n\nThis year, Repsol ran a new training action on the Code of Ethics and Conduct for all employees, in a web series format and focusing on anti-corruption, competition, crime prevention, data protection and workplace harassment. It also deployed a global training plan on basic ethics and compliance regulations that includes microlearnings on gifts and entertainment, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption and due diligence with third parties. The plan also included face-to-face or synchronous training sessions for the most exposed groups and further virtual sessions to optimize the use of the screening tool and to ensure a uniform and standard approach in accordance with the rules and regulations governing third-party due diligence norm.\n\nRepsol has pressed on with its internal plan to raise awareness of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, and other Compliance matters, so as to continue reinforcing the global culture of compliance across the Group.\n\nThe Code of Ethics and Conduct is available at www.repsol.com.",

The channel allows employees or any third party to raise queries and/or report possible breaches of the Code of Ethics and Conduct or the Crime Prevention Model to the Ethics and Compliance Committee directly, doing so with absolute confidentiality or anonymity if they so wish and in any language. Specifically this year, 59 communications have been received through the Ethics and Compliance channel, of which 45 have resulted in an investigation, having been confirmed at the end of the year, 2 cases of minor significance under the type of harassment, which after the investigations have not been accredited, being really conflicts between employees and none of discrimination, corruption or violation of human rights.\n\n| Ethics and Compliance                                                                         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of employees to have received online  training in the Code of Ethics and Conduct (1)   | 19,688 | 18,395 |\n| Number of communications received  through the ethics and compliance channel                  | 59     | 66     |\n| Number of corruption mitigation  controls (CPM)                                               | 438    | 432    |\n| Number of audit projects related  to compliance with the Ethics  and Conduct Code (2)         | 32     | 25     |\n| Number of ICFR controls to mitigate fraud                                                     | 1,054  | 1,046  |\n| Number of serious and very serious  offenses due to breach of the  Code of Ethics and Conduct | 169    | 373    |\n| Written warnings                                                                              | 5      | 10     |\n| Employment and wage suspensions                                                               | 123    | 294    |\n| Resignations                                                                                  | -      | -      |\n| Number of dismissals due to breaches  of the Code of Ethics and Conduct                       | 41     | 69     |\n\n## Fight against corruption and bribery\n\nIn its Anti-Corruption Policy, Repsol commits to preventing corruption and bribery by conducting its affairs in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations in all respects and in all countries where it operates, rejecting corruption in any form.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee is also Repsol's Crime Prevention Unit for the purposes of Article 31 bis (2)(2) of the Spanish Criminal Code. Repsol's prevention framework and response mechanisms facing breaches of the Code of Ethics and Conduct or suspected or confirmed criminal offenses within the scope of the Repsol Crime Prevention Model are structured around its policies titled 'Crime Prevention Model Management' and 'Internal Investigations by the Ethics and Compliance Committee'.\n\nRepsol also has a Crime Prevention Manual to provide a clearer understanding of crime risk and explain the behavior expected of all employees, together with a global training plan, which in 2020 included face-to-face or synchronous training events for new executives, heads of industrial facilities and key personnel in different countries, as well as an online course aimed at those responsible for running and managing Crime Prevention Model controls and the whistleblowing channels for raising queries and reporting breaches in relation to the Crime Prevention Model.\n\n## Protection of fair competition\n\nRepsol is firmly committed to complying with anti-trust regulations in all its spheres of action and in all countries in which it operates, making this a core element of Repsol's Ethics and Conduct Code. The Company believes in fair and effective competition on the market and we do not engage in inappropriate practices that might distort or restrict free competition. Nor do we seek to obtain competitive advantages through the use of unethical or illegal business practices.\n\nFurthermore, the Company has opted to implement a competition compliance program to create a compliance culture by preparing materials, such as policies and protocols, developing a specific online course and delivering synchronous and face-toface training on anti-trust issues.\n\nIn addition, Repsol has an Ethics and Compliance Channel as already mentioned, among other resources, where any employee or third party can express its concerns or send any query regarding compliance with competition laws.",

These assessments revealed material information on 18 companies relating to international sanctions, judicial investigations for fraud and/or bribery, fines for anti-competitive activities or environmental damage, and relationships with politically exposed persons. Based on the results obtained, the purchasing areas conduct due diligence processes through specific analyses defined in Repsol's internal regulations, in order to mitigate potential compliance risks.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 28 assessment audits were conducted at suppliers located in Spain and Portugal to analyze matters relating to quality, ethics and conduct, safety and the environment. Due respect for human rights was also confirmed through on-site inspections, which revealed that the companies operating in Spain and Portugal do not present any major non-conformities, but are earnest and reliable companies with which a business relationship can be safely established.\n\nTwo social audits were carried out in 2020. According to the findings of these audits, no contracts were terminated during the year. Meanwhile, a total of 2,007 performance assessments at 1,056 suppliers and contractors were completed in 2020, appraising environmental, labor, social and integrity aspects.\n\nIt is precisely this sustainable supply chain management that calls for greater transparency in the information disclosed in response to consumer demand, as well as the promotion of good practices among suppliers and contractors, who are required by the Company to comply with its Anti-Corruption Policy and minimum standards of human rights.\n\nSuppliers and contractors must also observe prevailing law and regulations and the Group's good practices when working at Repsol work centers and facilities.\n\nTo anticipate risks and ensure efficient supply chain management, the following process is followed:",

Outlook\n\n## Macroeconomic outlook\n\nIt is estimated that global GDP saw a notable decline (-3.5%) in 2020 due to the COVID-19. The evolution of this pandemic will continue to shape economy activity in the future.\n\nThe economic impact of both the pandemic and the lockdown measures has varied over time. The adverse economic impact of the restrictions now seems to be far less than in April and May of 2020, due to various factors: (i) the more recent restrictions are not as severe as during the first wave. The key difference is that most workplaces -including manufacturing- and most schools remain open; ii) supply disruptions in global supply chains were overcome; iii) individuals and organizations have adapted to working from home and other habits, with increased online shopping, etc; iv) orders previously delayed and demand from some countries that successfully controlled the pandemic, such as China, have helped sustain trade and activity within the manufacturing sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the progress made in vaccinating the population could mean that we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. In developed countries, where vaccination will be quicker, restrictions could begin to ease from the second quarter of 2021, or by the third quarter at the latest. Following on, the economic recovery should pick up pace on the back of demand and the increased rate of precautionary savings seen during the pandemic should steadily normalize as well. However, the new waves of the pandemic and the risks posed by the new, more contagious strains mean that the start of 2021 will be even more complicated, calling for even tighter restrictions in many countries.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, forecasts and projections will be fraught with uncertainty. The IMF's baseline scenario expects global GDP to grow by 5.5% in 2021, followed by 4.2% in 2022. However, trends will vary widely across countries and regions, as shown in the table below:\n\n## IMF macroeconomic Outlook\n\n|                     | Real   GDP growth (%)   | Real   GDP growth (%)   | Average inflation  (%)   | Average inflation  (%)   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                     | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2021                     | 2020                     |\n| Global economy      | 5,5                     | (3,5)                   | 3,4                      | 3,2                      |\n| Advanced  countries | 4,3                     | (4,9)                   | 1,3                      | 0,7                      |\n| Spain               | 5,9                     | (11,1)                  | 0,8                      | (0,3)                    |\n| Emerging countries  | 6,3                     | (2,4)                   | 4,2                      | 5,0                      |\n\nSource: IMF  (World  Economic  Outlook  January  2021)  and Repsol's Division of Business Studies & Analysis.\n\nThe following uncertainties will persist in the midterm: The adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy may be mitigated if faster adoption of digital technologies and new forms of organization leads to a swifter rise in productivity. Conversely, productivity could be hurt by an increase in protectionism and a shake-up in international supply chains.\n\n## Energy sector outlook\n\n## Short-term energy sector outlook\n\nOil is one of the energy sectors that most felt the impact of COVID-19; the short-term outlook for supply-demand fundamentals has undergone constant review.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), after publishing an initial estimate in March of an increase in average global demand in 2021 of +2.1 million bbl/d to 102 million bbl/d, now estimates an increase of +6.2 million bbl/d to 96.91 million bbl/d for December. This means that in 2021 global demand will not return to pre-crisis levels due to the sharp drop in consumption of -8.8 million bbl/d in 2020.\n\nConsumption among non-OECD and OECD countries looks set to increase by +5.9 million bbl/d and -6.6 million bbl/d, respectively, in 2021. The IEA expects non-OPEC countries to increase production by only 540 thousand bbl/d in 2021, with US supply shrinking by 510 thousand bbl/d. On the OPEC+ side, the market will be watching closely to see if cuts are implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on demand.",

Given the financial and regulatory pressure faced by the industry, production growth rates are expected to be moderate, with a possible decline in associated gas production from the Permian basin. However, dry gas production is expected to recover as prices stabilize and rise in Appalachia and Haynesville during the first half of the year.\n\nOn the demand side, the strong performance of consumption for electricity generation and the maintenance of high volumes of LNG for export may offset the weakness shown by consumption in the industrial segment, which would remain unchanged, and the residential/commercial segment, impacted by seasonality.

Meanwhile, the impact on demand of a continuing pandemic and the energy/climate policies rolled out by the new US administration will both be critical concerns.\n\n## Long-term energy sector outlook\n\nOn a global scale, hydrocarbons account for over half of the primary energy consumed. Specifically, 31% of global primary energy consumption is derived from oil, which is the most commonly used energy source, followed by coal (26%) and natural gas (23%). Other renewable sources besides hydropower contribute barely 2%.\n\nIn the coming years, the world should move toward a more sustainable scenario in which all energies are involved in the global energy matrix, hand in hand with technology and innovation. The International Energy Agency (IEA), a benchmark institution in the energy sector as to market analysis and outlook in the short, medium and long term, in its World Energy Outlook for 2020 presented a baseline scenario of declared policies in which primary energy demand would grow at an average rate of 1% per year until 2040. In that year, oil would continue to be the most widely used energy source, comprising 28% of the global matrix, followed by natural gas with 25%, coal with 19%, and other renewable sources different from hydro with 8%.\n\nBesides the baseline scenario, in its WEO 2020 the IEA proposes a 2040 sustainable development scenario. In this scenario, oil and gas continue to lead world energy consumption, but renewables (ex hydro) would already be the third most widely used source.\n\nOil and gas the most consumed primary energy sources by 2040 (28% and 25%, respectively)",

A capital reduction will follow, through redemption of treasury shares to avoid dilution shareholders choosing to receive their remuneration in cash. The July payment will be made in cash.\n\nIn the current environment, Repsol expects that in 2021 it will be able to generate cash to finance its investment needs and reward its shareholders.\n\nRepsol's Digital Program will drive forward the digital transformation as a lever to boost the energy transition and business efficiency by implementing new models, digital products and disruptive technologies. The main levers for the Industrial and Upstream businesses are Smart Assets that maximize efficiency, reliability and security, combined with increasing decarbonization. In the commercial business, we shall continue to work on advanced analytical and multi-channel customercentered models that offer multi-energy solutions adapted to customer needs, combined with strategic price analysis to attract new customers and enhance the loyalty of existing ones. Corporate areas will continue to develop solutions that enhance efficiency, employee satisfaction and business value through robotic process automation (RPA), an improved user experience, use of Big Data and Advanced Analytics, and cloud deployment strategy. The overall focus is on improving sustainability, achieving the goal of zero net carbon emissions by 2050, and investing in new internal digital capabilities and new ways of working.\n\nAs an additional lever, our Technology strategy will allow us to have the best alliances and partners in innovative disciplines, giving support to businesses to improve their competitiveness in the medium and long term and providing agility and efficiency.\n\n## 9.3. Highlights of 2021\n\nIn January, the discovery of new volumes of gas from the Caipipendi contract in Bolivia was confirmed, after finishing the Boicobo Sur X1 exploratory well tests ( see Section 7.1 ).\n\nIn January, Repsol also continued developing and implementing decarbonization technology initiatives ( see Section 8.3.1 ), reaching the following milestones:\n\n- \u00b7  Production of the first batch of biofuel for aviation at the Tarragona industrial complex.\n- \u00b7  Joining an international consortium to develop cutting-edge renewable hydrogen technology to create Europe's first 100 megawatt (MW) alkaline electrolyzer plant, which will be connected to a Repsol industrial site.\n\nOn February 3, 2021, Repsol International Finance B.V. notified the bondholders of the subordinated bonds issued in March 2015 ( see Note 6.4 to the consolidated Financial Statements ) of its decision to redeem the remaining balance of the issue (a nominal amount of 406 million euros) on March 25, which will entail an estimated payment of 422 million euros (including the nominal amount and any unpaid interest accrued to date).",

Such risks must be managed effectively in accordance with the established Risk Management Policy. This policy was revised in 2020 to comply with the latest recommendations of the CNMV's Code of Good Governance, which was in turn revised in June 2020.\n\nThe Company has an organization, procedures and systems that allow it to reasonably manage the\n\nrisks to which the group is exposed, such that risk management is an integral part of decision-making processes in both corporate governance bodies and business management. The Enterprise Risk Management System provides a comprehensive and reliable view of the risks that might affect the Company, which allows their joint management.\n\nThe Group's\u00b9 main risks are showed below based on their importance in terms of economic, reputation and people, taking into account a timeframe of 5 years:\n\n## Main Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The risks shown in the diagram are described in Appendix II 'Risks'.\n\n- (1) Relative economic importance is measured in terms of loss at the 95th percentile (potential loss in acid scenario) according to the probability distribution of losses for each of the risks.\n- (2) See Note 11 to the consolidated Financial Statements for 2020.\n\nSome of these risks are sensitive to the phenomenon of climate change and to the scenarios of transition to a low carbon economy, particularly those associated with regulation, future trends in demand, fluctuations in hydrocarbon and other commodity prices and the potential upswing in competition. Given the emerging nature of the climate change risks in the current energy context, and consistently with the commitments made, the\n\nGroup is extending the scope of the analysis of these risks -alongside other emerging risks-  according to a long-term time horizon. This risk map is regularly updated and the Sustainability Committee and the Audit and Control Committee are informed of the methodology used and the risk profile. For further information on emerging risks and climate change, see Section 8.1 Climate Change .",

        "page_content": "## Appendix I. Alternative performance measurements\n\nRepsol's financial information contains indicators and measures prepared in accordance with applicable financial reporting standards and regulations, as well as other measures prepared in accordance with the Group's Reporting Model, defined as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). APMs are measures that are 'adjusted' compared to those presented in accordance with IFRS-EU or with Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Upstream Activities, and the reader should therefore consider them in addition to, but not instead of, the latter.\n\nAPMs are useful for users of financial information as they are the measures employed by Repsol's Management to evaluate its financial performance, cash flows or financial position when making operational or strategic decisions for the Group.\n\nFor more historical quarterly APM information, see www.repsol.com.\n\n## 1. Financial performance measurements\n\n## Adjusted net income\n\nAdjusted net income is the key financial performance measure that Management (the Executive Committee) consults when making decisions.\n\nRepsol presents its segment 1 results including joint ventures or other companies which are jointly managed in accordance with the Group's investment percentage, considering its operational and economic indicators within the same perspective and degree of detail as those for companies consolidated under the full consolidation method. Thus, the Group considers that the nature of its businesses and the way in which results are analyzed for decision-making purposes is adequately reflected.\n\nAdjusted net income is calculated as Net income from continuing operations at Current Cost of Supply (or CCS) net of taxes and non-controlling interests. It excludes certain income and expenses ( Special items ) and the Inventory effect. Financial income is allocated to the adjusted net income of the 'Corporate and Others' segment.\n\nAdjusted net income is a useful APM for investors in evaluating the performance of operating segments while enabling increased comparability with Oil & Gas sector companies that use different inventory measurement methods ( see the following section ).\n\n## Inventory e/ffect\n\nFor current cost of supply (CCS) earnings, the cost of volumes sold is calculated on the basis of procurement and production costs incurred during the period in question and not based on weighted average cost (WAC), which is the accepted methodology under European accounting law and regulations. 2 The difference between CCS earnings and earnings at weighted average cost is included in the so-called Inventory E/uniFB00ect , which also includes other adjustments to the valuation of inventories (write-offs, economic hedges, etc.) and is presented net of taxes and minority interests. This Inventory Effect largely affects the Industrial segment. Repsol management considers that this measurement is useful for investors, considering the significant variations arising in the prices of inventories between periods.\n\nWAC is a generally accepted European accounting method for measuring inventories. It factors in purchase prices and historic production costs, valuing inventory at the lower between this cost and its market value.",

Since it does not include financial and tax indicators or accounting expenses not involving cash outflow, it is used by Management to evaluate the company's results over time, for a more straightforward exercise in making comparisons with peers within the Oil&Gas sector.\n\nEBITDA is calculated as Operating Income + Amortization + Impairment as well as other items which do not represent cash inflows or outflows from transactions (restructuring, capital gains/losses from divestment, provisions etc.). Operating income corresponds to the result from continuing operations at weighted average cost (WAC). Where Net income from continuing operations at Current Cost of Supply (CCS) is used, it is known as CCS EBITDA.\n\n|                            | Fourth Quarter          | Fourth Quarter          | Fourth Quarter                            | Fourth Quarter                            | Fourth Quarter           | Fourth Quarter           | Fourth Quarter   | Fourth Quarter   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                            | Group Reporting   Model | Group Reporting   Model | Joint venture reclassification  and other | Joint venture reclassification  and other | Inventory   E/uniFB00ect | Inventory   E/uniFB00ect | IFRS-EU (2)      | IFRS-EU (2)      |\n| Million euros              | 2020                    | 2019                    | 2020                                      | 2019                                      | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2020             | 2019             |\n| Upstream                   | 643                     | 1,058                   | (246)                                     | (348)                                     | -                        | -                        | 397              | 710              |\n| Industrial                 | 363                     | 563                     | (9)                                       | (5)                                       | 93                       | 31                       | 354              | 558              |\n| Commercial and  Renewables | 294                     | 255                     | (5)                                       | (4)                                       | 6                        | 6                        | 289              | 251              |\n| Corporate and Others       | (41)                    | (24)                    | (23)                                      | (18)                                      | -                        | -                        | (64)             | (42)             |\n| EBITDA                     | 1,259                   | 1,852                   | (283)                                     | (375)                                     | 99                       | 37                       | 976              | 1,477            |\n| Inventory effect  (1)      | (99)                    | (37)                    |                                           |                                           |                          |                          |                  |                  |\n| CCS EBITDA                 | 1,160                   | 1,815                   | (283)                                     | (375)                                     | 99                       | 37                       | 976              | 1,477            |\n\n- (2) Corresponds to ' Income before tax ' and ' Adjustments to income ' in the consolidated Cash Flow Statements prepared under IFRS-EU.",

This APM measures the funds generated by the Company before financial transactions (mainly debt issuance and repayments).\n\nFree cash flow measures cash flow generation from operating and investment activities, and is useful for evaluating the funds available for paying shareholder dividends and servicing debt.\n\n|                                                                                  | Fourth quarter       | Fourth quarter       | Fourth quarter                                 | Fourth quarter                                 | Fourth quarter                 | Fourth quarter                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                                                  | Adjusted   cash flow | Adjusted   cash flow | Reclassification of joint ventures  and others | Reclassification of joint ventures  and others | IFRS-EU statement of cash flow | IFRS-EU statement of cash flow |\n| Million euros                                                                    | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2020                                           | 2019                                           | 2020                           | 2019                           |\n| I.

This distinction is useful in understanding how the Group's Management allocates its resources and allows for a more reliable comparison of investment between periods.\n\n|                           | Fourth Quarter          | Fourth Quarter          | Fourth Quarter                             | Fourth Quarter                             | Fourth Quarter   | Fourth Quarter   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                           | Operating   investments | Operating   investments | Joint venture reclassification   and other | Joint venture reclassification   and other | IFRS-EU (1)      | IFRS-EU (1)      |\n| Million euros             | 2020                    | 2019                    | 2020                                       | 2019                                       | 2020             | 2019             |\n| Upstream                  | 182                     | 915                     | (85)                                       | (116)                                      | 97               | 799              |\n| Industrial                | 225                     | 389                     | (10)                                       | (6)                                        | 215              | 383              |\n| Commercial and Renewables | 339                     | 238                     | (42)                                       | (3)                                        | 297              | 235              |\n| Corporate and Others      | 23                      | 14                      | -                                          | -                                          | 23               | 14               |\n| Total                     | 769                     | 1.556                   | (137)                                      | (125)                                      | 632              | 1.431            |\n\n|                           | January - December      | January - December      | January - December                         | January - December                         | January - December   | January - December   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                           | Operating   investments | Operating   investments | Joint venture reclassification   and other | Joint venture reclassification   and other | IFRS-EU (1)          | IFRS-EU (1)          |\n| Million euros             | 2020                    | 2019                    | 2020                                       | 2019                                       | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n| Upstream                  | 948                     | 2,429                   | (230)                                      | (499)                                      | 718                  | 1,930                |\n| Industrial                | 565                     | 885                     | (14)                                       | (16)                                       | 551                  | 869                  |\n| Commercial and Renewables | 739                     | 491                     | (46)                                       | (12)                                       | 693                  | 479                  |\n| Corporate and Others      | 56                      | 56                      | -                                          | -                                          | 56                   | 56                   |\n| Total                     | 2,308                   | 3,861                   | (290)                                      | (527)                                      | 2,018                | 3,334                |",

Risks\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Repsol's Enterprise Risk Management System - [ERMS]\n\nRepsol has an Enterprise Risk Management System that, through the coordinated action of all units involved, allows the main risks associated with the Group's activities to be identified, measured, managed and supervised in a manner consistent with the risk policy, and monitors whether the management systems effectively mitigate these risks to the established levels. Repsol's Enterprise Risk Management System (ERMS) provides a comprehensive and reliable vision of all risks that may affect the Company, and is based on a Risk Management policy approved by the Board of Directors, the principles of which are set out in an Enterprise Risk Management standard approved by the Executive Committee.\n\nThe core pillars of the ERMS are:\n\n- \u00b7 Senior Management leads enterprise risk management.\n- \u00b7 The risk perspective is integrated into management and decision-making processes.\n- \u00b7 Businesses and corporate areas play a role in the implementation of the model with different levels of\n\nresponsibility and specialization (risk management units, supervisory units and audit units, in accordance with the Three Lines model) as well as the Risks Division, which governs and coordinates the system.\n\n- \u00b7 Risks are identified, assessed and addressed in accordance with the guidelines of ISO 31000.\n- \u00b7 Promotion of continuous improvement to gain efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nAnother key element is the risk tolerance statement which, together with the above principles, is included in the Risk Management policy. Repsol aspires to a low-to-medium risk profile that is appropriate for an integrated and diversified energy company, differentiating between risks in which the Company is ready to accept exposure within its overall tolerance threshold, and others in which it seeks to reduce exposure to levels as low as reasonably possible. The latter type would include accident, environmental, health, safety, ethics and conduct, image and reputation and compliance risks.\n\n## ISO 31000 Risk Management - Principles and guidelines\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In accordance with the ERMS, the risk profile of each management unit is reported at least once a year to the head of the unit for formal validation. However, if at any time it is thought that the Group's risk profile may have changed substantially due to a change in exposure to an especially significant risk, the analysis of such risks is updated.\n\nWhere appropriate, the head of the management unit sets in motion appropriate actions or control mechanisms 1 to align the risk profile with the organization's expectations, in line with the risk tolerance declaration set out in the Risk Management Policy.\n\nThe Risks Division consolidates individual risk maps to obtain the consolidated Risk Map for the Repsol Group, and any partial consolidation agreed to be reported to the executive and governing bodies, which, where appropriate, provide guidelines on the treatment of certain risks, in view of the risk profile, the maturity of risk management systems and the risk tolerance declaration set out in the Risk Management Policy.\n\nThe resulting mitigation actions are driven forward by the supervisor units 2 and, when they involve management units, converge with those units' own strategies.\n\nIn the course of these activities, the Risks Division collects information from the management and supervisor units on their performance and expectations in relation to achieving the objectives of the ERMS. This information collection is supplemented, when appropriate, with campaigns specifically designed to obtain certain data, such as surveys, backtesting studies and others. By reference to this information, the area responsible for the ERMS reviews effectiveness and ensures that the findings result in continuous improvement of the ERMS.\n\nAt all stages of the enterprise risk management process, in accordance with their planning, the audit units evaluate the reasonableness and adequacy of the design and operation of the Repsol Group's risk control and management systems, to ensure that risks are properly identified, prioritized, measured and controlled within the tolerance levels set by the Board in its Risk Management Policy, looking to prevailing standards and good industry practices. The audit units plan their engagements annually, based on the state of the risks and other considerations, with a focus on the key risks.\n\nThe variables in the economic models on which key decisionmaking processes are based, such as the preparation of the annual budget and the preparation and regular updating of the strategic plan, are subject to risk analysis, and information is received from the ERMS accordingly. Going beyond singlescenario approaches, these analyses provide a probabilistic view of the achievable result by simulating multiple scenarios in\n\nwhich these variables, correlated to some extent or another, take different values depending on their prior statistical modeling.\n\n## System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)\n\nThe Repsol Group has a System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) whose correct functioning can reasonably ensure the reliability of the Group's financial reporting. The ICFR model is based on the methodological framework of COSO 2013 ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) as set out in their report Internal Control-Integrated Framework , which provides an integrated framework for internal control over financial reporting that is designed to ensure that transactions are recorded faithfully, in conformity with the applicable accounting framework, providing reasonable assurance in the prevention or detection of errors that might have a material impact on the information contained in consolidated financial statements. The Audit, Control and Risks department annually evaluates the design and functioning of the Group ICFR and draws conclusions on its effectiveness.\n\n## Main risks\n\nThe main risks identified in Section 10 of this document are detailed below:",

Repsol takes the view that materiality analysis must be a comprehensive process that is integrated throughout the organization. Hence, in 2020, 19 areas of the organization and 22 countries took part in the project, including areas in charge of stakeholder relations, areas with expertise in Sustainability issues and the management team. Within the context of the health and economic crisis of 2020, a materiality study is especially useful to capture any changes in stakeholders' sustainability priorities.\n\n- Climate change and energy transition\n- Human capital\n- Human rights and community relations\n- Ethics and compliance\n- Products and services\n\nThe materiality analysis at Repsol is a process that spans four phases:\n\n1. Stakeholder analysis and relations: In 2020, the Company's stakeholder map was validated and consolidated. This map is structured into eight stakeholder groups (1. Shareholders, investors and financial institutions, 2. People in the Organization, 3. Customers, 4. Suppliers and contractors, 5. Peers, competitors and trade associations, 6. Public bodies and institutions, 7. Society and 8. Press and media), which are sub-divided into a total of 40 categories. In addition, the management areas and groups have been consulted on the effectiveness of the communication. Repsol's objective is to have a robust relationship process that facilitates two-way dialogue.",

        "page_content": "## Relations\n\n## with stakeholders\n\nEmployees: Human capital, Corporate governance and transparency, Ethics and compliance, Human rights and community relations, and Innovation and technology are the key issues for this stakeholder. The Company has opened up channels of communication and dialogue with employees both directly and through their union representatives in the corresponding negotiating committees, including the Sustainability Committee (created in 2019), to address issues and reach agreements. Committee meetings ensure monitoring of and compliance with collective bargaining agreements and agreements applicable to specific Group companies. The European Works Council of the Repsol Group stands out for their capacity for dialogue with workers' representatives at an international level.\n\n## Partners, competitors and business associations:\n\nRepsol maintains a constant relationship with this stakeholder through negotiation processes, alliances such as the OGCI [Oil and Gas Climate Initiative], sectoral associations, conferences and events. This stakeholder includes our partners and competitors in the energy industry, meaning they share Repsol's interest in climate change, corporate governance, safety and the environment. The importance of the Transparency issue for this stakeholder group rose strongly in 2020.\n\n## Public institutions and organizations:\n\nContact with this stakeholder is frequent and mainly takes the form of meetings and events, in any case at the frequency required by the di/uniFB00erent international, national, regional and local public institutions and organisations. Climate Change, Ethics and Compliance, Corporate Governance and Environment are the key issues for this stakeholder group.\n\n## Media:\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions is the key issue for this stakeholder, followed by Adaptation to climate change and Respect for labor rights. These are followed by issues surrounding Ethics and Compliance (Integrity and International Sanctions) and Environment (Water Management and Air Quality), with a significant increase in the priority accorded to Air Quality. Repsol is regularly in contact with this stakeholder through press releases and communiqu\u00e9s, interviews, articles, etc.\n\nCustomers: Repsol maintains a constant dialog with this stakeholder through its extensive commercial network, participation at specialist fairs and events, technical assistance services, customer service and the points of sale network. In 2020, we focused on this stakeholder group by conducting 400 surveys and 1,200 interviews. The issues rated most highly as a priority by this stakeholder group include Products and Services, Environment and Safety.\n\n## Shareholders, investors and financial institutions:\n\nRepsol engages in continuous communication and dialog with this group. The CEO of the Company, Josu Jon Imaz, directs and leads senior management roadshows with socially responsible investors to respond to their requests for information on Sustainability. At year-end 2020, socially responsible shareholders accounted for 32% of shares held by institutional shareholders. Corporate Governance, Climate Change, Ethics and Compliance, and Safety are the key issues for this stakeholder group.\n\n132\n\n## Suppliers and contractors:\n\nMany members of this stakeholder group work at assets operated by Repsol and, therefore, have a shared interest in matters related to the Safety axis. In addition, for them it is vital that the Company acts ethically, protecting the group's data and integrity. In 2020, issues related to Products & Services and Supply Chain rose in significance. Repsol maintains a fluid relationship with this stakeholder throughout the management process, from procurement to operations.\n\nCompany: This stakeholder includes local communities, including indigenous populations, trade unions, NGOs, academia, civil society and citizens. Respect for labor rights, stable working environment and attention to employee welfare are the key issues for this stakeholder group. In 2020, this stakeholder group continued to focus on the Climate Change and Human Rights axes. This stakeholder group seeks to ensure that companies such as Repsol prevent and mitigate the key environmental and social impacts of their activities. It also attaches high priority to integrity. Contact and interaction with these stakeholders take on many forms, including meetings, social programs, commercial activities, social media, etc. Furthermore, the Sustainability information that Repsol publishes responds to all requests for information received and participates actively in cross-sectorial taskforces, presentations, conferences and debates on this matter.",

        "page_content": "- 2. Identification of potentially material topics: In 2020, as in 2019, a list of 34 sustainability-related topics with the potential to generate challenges and opportunities for both the company and its stakeholders were identified. These topics have been categorized into 10 focal points.\n- 3. Prioritization of material topics: Internal prioritization (Importance for Repsol) is carried out through consultations with the heads of the business units and corporate areas and through alignment with the sustainability risks identified in the Company's Risk Map. External prioritization (Importance for stakeholders) is carried out through consultations with stakeholders and the company areas and departments responsible for managing the relationship with these stakeholders. In 2020, more than 5,000 interviews and surveys were conducted, with a participation rate of 74%. Further, an artificial intelligence tool was used to globally compare our material topics with other companies operating in the sector, current legislation and thousands of news items in the media and across the social networks. Last but not least, Repsol analyzed more than 100 documents that reflect the needs and demands of stakeholders obtained through consultations, initiatives, analyses and other projects derived from direct dialogue with stakeholders.\n- 4. Construction of materiality matrixes: Based on the assessments explained in the previous point, the materiality matrixes are calculated and thresholds are designated in order to work out the most significant or material topics. After applying these thresholds in 2020, a total of 24 material topics were identified (21 topics in 2019). One global company-wide matrix and eight specific stakeholder matrices were obtained.\n\nThe Repsol 2020 Materiality Analysis integrates the concept of double materiality described in Article 1 of Directive 2014/95/ EU as regards disclosure of non-financial information. To this end, Repsol incorporates expectations in terms of sustainability, both of investors, who take into account the impact of the environment on the Company's activity (financial materiality) and of stakeholders (customers, civil society, employees, suppliers and contractors) who are affected by the impact of the Company's activity on the environment (environmental and social materiality). In addition, the management team and Repsol's sustainability risk map help determine financial materiality by assessing the impact of the environment on the Company.\n\nThe findings of the materiality analysis are embedded in the Sustainability Strategy and deployed downstream through the Global Plan and Local Sustainability Plans. The actions under the plans, locally and globally, are aimed at improving performance and minimizing the impact of identified sustainability risks.

At the General Meeting of May 8, 2020, the report received wide support, as it was approved by a majority of the 89.562% of the capital attending the meeting. Furthermore, and with the aim of assisting shareholders in understanding the information in the official model of the Report on Remuneration, and to continue increasing the transparency of remuneration schemes, the Company has also published an additional voluntary report in recent years on this topic that contains more detailed, comprehensive information on the remuneration of Executive Directors.\n\nWith respect to 2020, the Company has produced the Annual Remuneration Report since 2018, using a free-form approach, together with the statistical appendix, so that shareholders and stakeholders can have all relevant information on the remuneration of the Directors.\n\nAlso, the General Shareholders' Meeting of Saturday, May 31, 2019 approved, with 95.4% of votes in favor, the Remuneration Policy of Directors of Repsol, S.A. for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The policy contains, among other matters, forecasts on the partial payment in shares of long-term variable remuneration and the policy on holding of shares.\n\nThe average remuneration of Directors, by gender, is shown below:\n\n| Average Director remuneration by gender (\u20ac)   |         |           | 2019    | 2019      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|\n|                                               | Women   | Men       | Women   | Men       |\n| Director average                              | 286,966 | 333,567   | 291,025 | 330,378   |\n| Chairman                                      | N/A     | 2,500,000 | N/A     | 2,500,000 |\n\nFor more information, please see the Annual Remuneration Report.",

In addition, the Company is focusing on the promotion of projects of advanced biofuels (based on non-food raw materials) with a strong technological content and high reduction of the carbon footprint. Work is currently under way at the Technology Hub.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of its biofuels, Repsol has signed up to international frameworks that certify compliance with the sustainability parameters defined in the Renewables Directives (RED I and RED II) and the traceability of the raw materials employed throughout the chain of production, from their origin to the finished product. Specifically, at its industrial plants and centers, the Company's operations follow the ISCC1 sustainability frameworks, 1 and they have been certified under the National Sustainability Verification System (SNVS). The percentage of biofuels physically incorporated into gasoline and diesel fuel in 2020 is higher than the minimum limits mandated by law.\n\nIt is worth noting that during 2020, biofuels manufactured using raw materials recovered from waste have been included in the portfolio, thus reducing emissions even further than is normally the case with conventional or first generation biofuels.\n\nThe total volume of biofuels incorporated into the fuels marketed by Repsol in 2020 was 1,121,653 m 3 (1,498,275 in 2019), of which 479,985 m 3 (576,953 in 2019) were produced at the Group's refineries, and the rest, 641.668 m 3 (921,322 in 2019), were bought from third-party companies and blended in the right proportion to meet gasoline and diesel specifications and our customers' requirements. These biofuels have reduced emissions released during transport by 2.3 million tons of CO2. Repsol's biofuel production capacity is 871,000 m 3 /year, divided up between BioETBE (429,000 m 3 /year) and hydrogenated vegetable oil (GVO, 442,000 m 3 /year).\n\nIn line with its strategy to become a net-emission-free company by 2050, in July Repsol produced the first batch of biojet in the Spanish market at the Puertollano refinery, thus becoming the pioneer in the manufacture of this sustainable aviation fuel in Spain. This first batch comprises 7,000 tons of bio-based aviation fuel. Its use will avoid the emission of 440 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, the equivalent of 40 Madrid-Barcelona flights. In addition, in December a second batch of biojet was manufactured at the Tarragona refinery, comprising 10,000 tons of bio-based fuel.\n\nAs part of Repsol's strategy in this domain, in September 2020 the Board of Directors approved plans to build Spain's first plant for the production of advanced low-emission biofuels at the Cartagena refinery. The plant will have a production capacity of 250,000 tons of advanced hydrobiodiesel, and will also produce pure biojet. Placing this production on the market will prevent the emission of 900,000 tons of CO2 per year. The construction phase is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. The investment of 188 million euros will become operational during the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## Environment\n\n## Non-GHG emissions\n\n[305-7] Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and other significant air emissions.\n\n[EM-EP-120a.1] [EM-RM-120a.1] [RT-CH-120a.1] Atmospheric emissions of NOx (excluding N2O), SOx, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM10), H2S (only in Refining & Marketing), HAPs (only in Chemicals)\n\n| SO2, NOx and NMVOC emissions (t)   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| SO2                                | 24,401 | 26,949 |\n| NOx                                | 18,825 | 19,876 |\n| NMVOC                              | 24,361 | 31,747 |\n\nSO2 and NOx emissions in the Refining and Chemicals businesses are measured with continuous concentration and smoke flow analyzers. When there is no continuous analyzer, internal environmental parameter guideline are applied, where the methodology for calculating these emissions is established.\n\nIn the rest of the businesses, the environmental parameters guideline is applied when the applicable regulations do not define a direct calculation or measurement methodology.\n\nIn the case of non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions, it is estimated using the methodology established in the environmental parameters guideline when there is no applicable local regulation.\n\n## Disclosure of significant atmospheric emissions by activity\n\n## Disclosure of significant atmospheric emissions by activity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSO2 emissions were down by 9,5% compared to 2019; NOx emissions were down by 5% and NMVOC emissions by 23%. The reduction of SO2 and NOx is mainly due to Refining having reduced its production activity. The reduction of NMVOCs is mainly due to the E&P Canada asset, owing to the drop in production at Edson and Chauvin.",

This involves contributing to improving the environment by reducing the release of volatile components into the atmosphere. All our facilities were improved to limit the content\n\nin compounds, such as aromatics, sulfur and benzene; our most\n\nrecent investment was in the construction of new units in Peru to produce diesel and gasolines with a 0.005% sulfur mass with additional limits on the content of aromatics and benzene. The Commercial businesses are also reducing the release of volatile organic compounds through the installation of operating procedures and systems.\n\nThe fuel that Repsol markets meets the current quality specifications applicable. Repsol sells mainly in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Peru and Mexico. Where fuel was not produced at Repsol's facilities, the Company has agreements with independent laboratories that carry out product analysis to ensure compliance.\n\n| Maximum content   | Europe   | Mexico (3)   | Peru (3)   |\n|-------------------|----------|--------------|------------|\n| Sulfur mg/kg      | 10       | 15           | 50-2,000   |\n| Benzene %v        | <1       | <1 or <2     | (2)        |\n\nRepsol fuels have a safety sheet and a technical sheet, where consumers can consult information on the benzene and sulfur content in gasolines and diesel fuels.

For example, the requirements in the European Union under the Water Framework Directive, the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Best Available Techniques Reference Documents (BREFs).\n\nFor the Exploration and Production business, specific quality standards have been implemented to ensure minimum quality of discharges when there is no applicable regulation, through\n\nthe Environmental Performance Practices (EPPs) on the quality of sanitary effluents, drilling fluids and production water and their impact on the environment, and the technical guide that establishes Plans for waste water disposal. These technical complementary documents for internal reference, take into account international standards recommended by IOGP, IPIECA and EPA.\n\nThe Refining and Chemical divisions have teams of water experts dedicated to disseminate knowledge, allowing to improve the management of the water discharge of processing units, by controlling the key parameters at the source, to implement best practices for metering or to develop guidelines for treating effluents.\n\n)\n\n| Water discharge (303-4)                                                                       | Water discharge (303-4)                                                                       | 2019             | 2019                        | 2020             | 2020                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                               |                                                                                               | All areas (m 3 ) | Water-stressed areas (m 3 ) | All areas (m 3 ) | Water-stressed areas (m 3 |\n| Water discharge by destination                                                                | Water discharge by destination                                                                |                  |                             |                  |                           |\n| Surface water                                                                                 | Surface water                                                                                 | 11,409,076       | -

Non-hazardous waste decreased by 66% mainly due to E&P Canada, where fewer contaminated site remediation projects were executed in 2020, in accordance with the program established by the business unit.

The following table shows the number of species that may be present at the Company's assets, by level of extinction risk:\n\n| Classification             |   Number of species |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Critically endangered (CR) |                  96 |\n| Endangered (EN)            |                 248 |\n| Vulnerable (VU)            |                 628 |\n| Near threatened (NT)       |                 763 |\n\nIn 2019, we reported 22 critically endangered, 73 endangered, 355 vulnerable and 429 threatened species. In 2020, indicator values rose, because the method was improved: in the analysis of species, we considered all the operating centers of Repsol's different businesses except activities with a high geographical scattering (service stations, for example) or activities of a temporary nature.\n\nRepsol has 38% of proven reserves at operated blocks and 41% of probable reserves within or adjacent to protected areas.\n\n## [G4-OG4] - Number and percentage of significant operating sites in which biodiversity risk has been assessed and monitored\n\nThe following table sets out the percentage of major operating centers of the Exploration and Production business where risks to biodiversity were assessed and monitored:\n\n| Classification                                                                        | Result (%)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Centers where biodiversity-related risks have  been assessed                          | 100%         |\n| Centers where biodiversity-related risks have  been found                             | 100% (1)     |\n| Centers in which the area of influence has been  calculated                           | 100%         |\n| Centers with specific biodiversity management  and ecosystem services                 | 100%         |\n| Degree of implementation of  specific biodiversity management  and ecosystem services | 100%         |",

The COVID-19 Coordination and Monitoring Committee has promoted various initiatives, among others: (i) adopting new approaches to organizing shift work in industrial activities; (ii) maintaining service at service stations in accordance with the safety and service requirements prescribed by the competent authorities; (iii) enabling agile teleworking for a large number of employees, with no impact on their productivity; or (iv) enabling a safe and orderly return to the new normality at the different work centers, guaranteeing the necessary biological capacity and individual protection measures.\n\nFor Repsol it has been a priority to protect employment during the crisis situation, in Spain and under the framework of actions to support the Company's Resilience Plan. Operations in nonstrategic countries were downsized (20% reduction in Asia and 15% in Africa). Due to the decrease in market demand, the number of employees with temporary contracts has been 24% lower than in the previous year.\n\nThe information on employees is itemized below. Total staff (under own management and otherwise, calculated by percentage of occupancy of each employee), was 26,726 in 2020 (27,389 in 2019).\n\n| Overall employee figures   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Headcount  (1)             | 24,125 | 25,228 |\n| Average age                | 43.2   | 42.6   |\n\n| Nationalities by country (1)   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Spain                          |     60 |     66 |\n| Canada                         |     20 |     19 |\n| US                             |     22 |     26 |\n| Algeria                        |     10 |     16 |\n| Portugal                       |     11 |     11 |\n| Brazil                         |     10 |     10 |\n| Norway                         |     10 |     12 |\n| Malaysia                       |      8 |      8 |\n| Peru                           |      8 |     11 |\n| United Kingdom                 |      6 |      8 |\n\n(1) Countries with the largest number of nationalities (excluding those of the country itself).

Criteria for establishing the sought-after wage positioning are generally similar in all employee and executive groups. Accordingly, with the compensation policy, in general terms, the data in the table are affected by the typical wage dispersion of the country and business sector in which the Company operates.\n\nOn an annual basis, the budgets for wage increases are decided by employee group, and criteria are established for maximum individual increases. The increase of the average wage of the entire workforce reflects the wage bills of the workforce of each professional group and the wage increase percentages applied to each group, both those approved by the company and those established through collective bargaining or by legal requirement. Further, the compensation of the highest-paid individual may also increase or decrease owing to variable components, which take on greater weight in positions involving higher responsibilities, even if the base wage remains unchanged.\n\nIn general, there were no substantial changes with respect to the previous year. In general terms, the evolution of the ratio was affected by the vegetative turnover of the workforce.\n\n## Annual total compensation of the highest-paid (1) individual/median annual total compensation for all employees (2)\n\n## Percentage increase of annual total compensation of highest-paid individual/Percentage increase of average annual total compensation of all employees\n\n| Country  (4)    |   2020 | 2019   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Bolivia         |   2.28 | 3.43   | (0.11) | (0.69) |\n| Ecuador         |  12.71 | 11.14  | (1.84) | 1.17   |\n| Spain (3)       |  13.88 | 13.94  | 2.73   | (3.90) |\n| Peru            |  14.78 | 13.50  | (9.30) | 0.58   |\n| Portugal        |   6.59 | 5.18   | (1.85) | (2.36) |\n| Repsol S.A.

At the Company's discretion, hours of absenteeism exclude incidents caused by occupational accidents or professional illnesses. This year, figures are included for Malaysia, Ecuador and Norway, and thus encompass 97.35% of total employees.\n\nRepsol has employees under collective bargaining agreements in Spain, Peru, Portugal, Brazil, Indonesia, France, Italy and Norway.

The aim of each action is to help employees become aware of their health and well-being and preserve or improve it.\n\n## [403-1] Occupational health and safety management system\n\nThe health management system covers all company employees in all activities and work centers. Emergency medical care also covers contractors.\n\nRepsol complies with the legal requirements of each of the countries where it operates and with its own internal regulations, following the best practices of the industry (IOGP, OSHAS). Repsol is regularly audited internally and externally in accordance with the legislation of each country or for obtaining and maintaining certifications, integrated in each business.\n\nInternal regulations are reviewed regularly to incorporate legislative changes and improvements. The latest review started in 2020 and will be completed in 2021.\n\nRepsol SA and Repsol Bolivia are certified as Empresa Saludable (\"Healthy Company\").\n\n## [403-3] Occupational health services\n\nHealth services are available in all countries where Repsol is present to cover health care and preventive and health promotion activities. In some countries the services are covered in part by the company's own employees (Bolivia, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal and Venezuela). In the remaining countries they are engaged from a supplier. All professionals who provide these services have the necessary qualifications according to the type of activity to be performed: occupational health, emergency care, community health, etc.\n\nMedical centers are on or offsite depending on the type of activity and work center. In offshore and field sites and large industrial facilities, a medical center is available within the facility itself and provides care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At office buildings, such as in Madrid, Lisbon, Quito, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Puerto La Cruz, medical services are available at the work center itself and cover the whole or part of the business day, depending on the number of employees at the center and the requirements of each country's legislation.\n\nPreventive medical examinations are conducted according to protocols drawn up according to assessed risks at the workplace and at the intervals established in the legislation of each country. The checkups are managed by Medical Services or by a representative of the country's occupational health function. Depending on the type of risk to which an employee is exposed, a medical examination may be mandatory or voluntary.\n\nThe confidentiality of medical information is protected by using computer applications that conform to the data protection laws in force in the country or to Repsol's own standards, which follow Spanish legislation. Only employees themselves have access to their health data.\n\nCompliance with health data protection regulations is regularly audited internally. There may be external audits if the country's legislation so requires.\n\nThe company receives prevention recommendations for workstation or activity adaptations or support measures for emergency evacuation without reference to the health reason for these recommendations.\n\nAggregate information from medical examinations and health campaigns is also provided to evaluate the performance of preventive and health promotion programs and make improvements.",

This committee comprises  representatives elected by the employer and by the employees.  In general terms, the role of the HSC is to advise and assist with health and safety  in the workplace (but it is not responsible for management). This includes hearing and addressing concerns raised by workers, identifying hazards,  developing and promoting education programs, taking part in investigations where appropriate, and conducting quarterly safety inspections. As a  result of these changes, HSCs have been established at our three locations in Canada: Calgary, Edson and Chauvin. |\n| Colombia       | Joint Committee on Health and Safety in the workplace (COPASST): meets once a month, with workers accounting for 15% of its members   (8/53 people); management representatives and employee representatives are represented in the same proportion.

These rights encompass the rights set forth in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles set forth in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work,\n\nas well as the eight Fundamental Conventions that implement them: freedom of association (N. 87), collective bargaining (N. 98), forced labor (N. 29, N. 105), child labor (N. 138, N. 182), fair wages (N. 100) and discrimination (N. 111). Repsol promotes respect for employees' human rights and ensures compliance with these rules throughout the value chain. ( For further information, see Appendix III-Human Rights and Community Relations - indicators [407-1], [408-1], [409-1].)\n\nMoreover, the unique nature of indigenous, tribal, aboriginal and native peoples is recognized and respected. Repsol also recognizes and respects their rights, in accordance with current legislation and ILO Convention 169, whether or not it is part of the national regulations of a given country.\n\nThis includes, inter alia, rights to land, territory and resources, including the right to water; to their organization and to their social and economic structure; and to free, prior and informed consultation, through appropriate procedures and, in particular, through their representative institutions, whenever legislative or administrative measures are envisaged that may affect them directly, in good faith and in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, with the aim of seeking understanding or contributing to the achievement of consent on proposed mitigation measures.\n\nWorking in a conflict zone requires using strategies that do not aggravate the conflict and promote peace, such as:\n\n- \u00b7  Partnership with prestigious international organizations such as the UNDP (United Nations Development Program) to carry out social investment projects that improve the quality of life of local communities and show an ongoing commitment to sustainable development.\n- \u00b7  Implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights on the use of security forces in our operations.\n- \u00b7  Human rights training for employees of the National Oil Company to raise the standard of work.\n- \u00b7  Support for HSE culture to ensure the safety of employees and operations.\n- \u00b7  Compliance with Repsol's highest Ethics and Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) standards and requirements.\n- \u00b7  Gaining our license to operate by building up the Operator social performance skills.\n\nRepsol is currently operating in Libya, where it leads a consortium of companies that work alongside the National Oil Company at two assets. Repsol works to the highest human rights and security standards in all its operations, with special attention to conflict areas. Stakeholder identification is key to human rights management, in conjunction with risk assessment and training of security contractors. In Libya, we place our human rights expertise at the disposal of the consortium and provide training to National Oil Company employees to ensure compliance with the Company's standards.\n\nThe Company's goal is to build strong relationships with communities within the area of influence of our projects and",

For indigenous communities, this is reflected in the signing of formal agreements to create shared value with the communities and support their sustainable development.\n\nThe political commitment, due diligence processes and grievance mechanisms are detailed in Section 8.2.2 Respect for human rights and community relations , as adapted to the specific rights of indigenous peoples.\n\n## [EM-EP-210b.1.] [RT-CH-210a.1] Discussion of engagement processes to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests\n\nThe Company has in place an organization, procedures and systems so as to reasonably manage the social, environmental, cultural and economic risks surrounding the management of human rights of communities in the areas in which Repsol operates. This risk management constitutes an integral component of the Company's decision-making process, at the level of corporate governance bodies and in business management. Human rights risks are integrated with corporate management as part of the Enterprise Risk Management System (ERMS System), both in the management of strategic risks (reputation and image) and operational risks (Code of Ethics and Conduct).\n\nThe due diligence processes applied by Repsol to assess impacts arising from start-up of operations are set out in Section 8.2.2 of Respect for human rights and community relations and in the corresponding section of Appendix III , as adapted to the specific rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Company applies its Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment Standard (ESHIA) to ensure that environmental, social and health impacts are properly identified and mitigated. This ensures that our businesses engage in inclusive dialogue with stakeholders during the impact assessment process, provide them with relevant information and involve them in the actions to be undertaken as specified in the prevention, mitigation and monitoring plan. The measures to be implemented to manage environmental, social and health impacts consider the needs and priorities of stakeholders and avoid direct monetary compensation.\n\nDifferent processes, procedures and practices are in place to manage community interests:\n\n- \u00b7  Implementation of specific socially sensitive environmental projects.\n- \u00b7  Engagement with local organizations that protect community interests.\n- \u00b7  Opening of channels for direct dialogue, such as the Public Advisory Panel, where local residents' concerns and interests can be discussed.\n\nAs a practical example of social impact mitigation, in an area of Wayuu indigenous communities in Colombia, the Company conducted a human rights impact assessment with an inclusive approach and respect for indigenous cultures. Repsol's approach was previously presented to the traditional local authorities. Interviews were conducted so as to achieve diversity, with the goal of ensuring the active involvement of the communities. The study results were shared with the communities through collective meetings in the local language (wayunikki), where issues related to territoriality, loss of identity of young people, and labor, economic, women's and environmental rights were identified. However, the key identified issue was the protection of sacred spaces and the cultural impact. As there was no feasible mitigation measure, the Company's decision was not to continue operations in this block, consistently with Repsol's policy in terms of recognition and respect for communities' cultural diversity.\n\nExamples of environmental impact prevention and mitigation are set out in Section 8.4 Environment .\n\nThe Company identifies and strengthens positive impacts and shared value in regions where it is present as a result of a consensus with communities. A key tool for achieving positive impacts are social investment initiatives. Priority is given to entrepreneurship projects that empower local communities to avoid future dependency. Furthermore, our activity has a positive impact through wealth creation in our sphere of influence, via local employment and supplier development. The context determines the scope and specific form of the investment. In 2020, social investment came to 37.8 million euros. See Indicator (203-1 and 203-2) for more information and examples of social investment projects.\n\nMonetary contributions to foundations and non-profit entities in 2020 amounted to 7.01 million euros (8.49 million euros in 2019).",

Repsol also collaborates with the corresponding authorities to transfer the necessary responsibilities, once the Company no longer has a presence in the area.\n\nThe Company has internal regulations on asset integrity and risk management, which ensure that any major accident scenarios that may occur during dismantling are identified and evaluated, including those that may arise from interference with assets in operation. For each identified scenario, measures are implemented that seek to preferably eliminate or minimize these hazards, and when this not possible, control and/or mitigate them, so that the risks to health and the environment are tolerable.\n\nIn 2020, 9 service stations were dismantled, and 31 service stations and the thermal power stations at Escucha, Puertollano and Tarragona are in the process of being dismantled. In the Exploration and Production business, work has been done in 2020 on the dismantling of 6 blocks in Bolivia, Norway, the United States and Peru. A highlight was the dismantling of the Mapi and Mashira wells in Block 57 in Peru, where an Ecological Restoration Plan is being carried out under an agreement with the Eco Ash\u00e1ninka indigenous organization. Replanting monitoring is coming to and end and the social investment plan established in the abandonment strategy is being implemented.\n\n## [EM-EP-210b.2.] Number and duration of non-technical delays\n\nIn 2020, there were 3 stops for non-technical reasons for a total duration of 495 days.\n\nIn Norway, the Gyda P&A asset was shut down for 215 days at the Company's discretion due to COVID-19 restrictions, while in Brage there was a reduction in production equivalent to 15 days due to government restrictions also caused by the pandemic. In Libya, political instability forced the shutdown of asset NC115/NC186 for 265 days due to force majeure.\n\n## Safe Operation\n\n## [403-2] Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation\n\nRepsol regularly conducts job position evaluations by competent personnel. We also systematically apply communication and hazard identification techniques such as tool box talks, JSA (Job Safety Analysis). Together with the work permit system, these ensure the implementation of risk minimization measures before work begins. Moreover, asset operating units have in place a Stop Work Authority policy that empowers any worker, whether our own or a contractor's, to stop operation if he/she believes circumstances may arise that could endanger his/her integrity, that of others or that of the asset, without fear of retaliation, in line with the principle set forth in the Company's Health, Safety and Environment Policy.\n\n## [403-7] Prevention and mitigation of impacts on the health and safety of workers directly linked to business relations\n\nRepsol is a global energy company with a presence throughout the value chain, with strong and diverse business relationships at the different stages of the life cycle of the products and services the company offers. In this context, the safety requirements specified in the safety management system and in the Global Sustainability Plans must be tailored to the specific features of the businesses, assets, operations and products, whether managed directly by Repsol or through business relationships with third parties. As an example, Repsol embeds specific safety requirements in the stages of approval, tendering and assessment of contractors and suppliers. Similarly, Repsol encourages the development of safety requirements by carrying out safety culture diagnostics in non-operational settings, launching awareness campaigns or holding specific scheduled safety conferences and events. The Company also provides contractors and business partners with resources to reinforce the safety culture: safe working environments, Basic Safety Rules, White Paper on Safety Culture, etc. In addition, safety data sheets are drawn up for the entire range of products, intermediate and final, and released to contractors and customers, thus promoting safe use and handling. Moreover, we support analysis and reporting of all safety incidents related to the Company's operations, activities and/or products, including those outside the Company's own management framework. The overarching goal is to have an impact on continuous improvement of safety at all levels through the learning acquired.",

For each accident scenario, the inquiry also analyzes all root causes that may have contributed to the harm, identifying technical, human or organizational shortcomings. In 2020, hazards categorized as thermal contact and striking by objects or tools were those that caused highconsequence injuries. The Company's regulations include measures to control risk in line with an inherently safe design. For example, under the SMA Risk Management Standard one requirement is inherent design safety. Process and plant design must prioritize elimination of hazards and maximize inherent safety. In addition, improvement actions can be derived from different sources (incidents and preventive SMA analyses). In the case of incidents, actions act on all root causes identified and are classified according to criticality in terms of potential role in avoiding harm. All identified improvement actions must be: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. The implementation of improvement actions is monitored to validate effectiveness as applicable, and close out each action.",

Repsol seeks to be publicly recognized as a company of integrity and fiscal responsibility. The Group's tax decisions are  adopted responsibly in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of tax regulations, and are aligned with the economic  activity of Repsol's different businesses. The tax function is present in the Group's business decisions to ensure that they are in line with the principles of its Tax Policy  and with the economic reality and motivation of its businesses. Hence there are internal regulations and procedures (the  rules on investments, related-party transactions, etc.) that ensure the adoption of tax positions based on sound economic or  business grounds (avoiding abusive tax planning schemes or practices), avoidance of opaque or artificial corporate structures  to hide or reduce the transparency of activities, and application of the principle of open competition in intra-group transactions.                                                                                                                    |\n| GRI 207-2.

For further information on how the tax approach is integrated into Repsol's organization, see the report on the  'Tax Control  Framework'  published on the corporate website. https://www.repsol.com/es/sostenibilidad/fiscalidad-responsable/marco- control-fiscal/index.cshtml Integration of the tax approach at Repsol is governed by an orderly compliance management model comprisingpolicies, rules  (general and specific), internal procedures and standardized processes, all of which are subject to the guidelines of the Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Description of tax  governance and  control framework                                                             | a.iii)  Tax risks,  identification,  management and  monitoring                       | Tax risk management at Repsol is embedded in the global policy of the Enterprise Risk Management System (ERMS in  Spanish) and is reflected in the existence of processes, systems and internal controls (ICFR, Compliance Plan, Key Controls,  etc.). A cornerstone of the ERMS is the concern to maintain a risk profile that is aligned with a medium-low risk tolerance,  typical of a global and integrated multi-energy company business model that is present throughout the value chain. To  mitigate tax compliance risks, Repsol has implemented standardized and documented processes that regulate essential  aspects of tax compliance. Such processes identify the people/areas responsible for each phase of tax management and  specify all activities to be carried out for the preparation of tax returns and self-assessments. Tax management processes  must, therefore, ensure the reliability and traceability of the information and establish a suitable level of prior reviews. In addition, Repsol operates robust information management systems that assure the integrity of the information and tax  compliance processes while minimizing the possibility of 'human error.' |",

These include, inter alia: (i) the procedure for monitoring and periodic  evaluation of the system of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). ICFR controls are continuously overseen by the  Audit and Control Committee of the Group's Board of Directors and monitored by the Internal Control department and the  Audit department. Rules and procedures are reviewed by the People and Organization department, whose purpose is to assure the integrity,  uniformity, validity, availability and accessibility of the Company's internal regulatory documents and to support management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                              |                                                                                  | b.)

Tax content verification  process                                           | Repsol has an expert team that analyzes the good tax governance initiatives of international organizations to align its tax  strategy with the principles that inform global best practices. Hence Repsol performs a self-assessment of its tax control framework by comparing it to the highest standards in tax  governance, including the B-team principles of responsible taxation, the requirements of GRI 207 and the OECD model  for controlling tax risks, among others. The alignment of the tax control framework to international best practices in tax  compliance is verified and tested by an independent expert. According to the expert's evaluation, Repsol's tax control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Stakeholder  engagement and  management of  tax concerns (1) | a.i)  Commitment to  tax authorities                                             | In accordance with the principles that guide our tax policy, Repsol is committed to supporting an effective tax system and  maintaining cooperative relations with the tax authorities of the countries where it operates, based on mutual respect,  transparency and trust. To this end, Repsol cooperates with tax authorities in the detection and search for solutions to  fraudulent tax practices, facilitates access to information and prioritizes non-litigious channels for dispute resolution. This  approach encompasses adherence to cooperation agreements and active audits in real time. Key examples of Repsol's initiatives in the field of cooperative relations include: (i) voluntary adherence in Spain to the Code  of Good Tax Practices, and presentation, since 2015, of the Voluntary Tax Transparency Report; (ii) Repsol's qualification as  an Authorized Economic Operator in the European Union and Peru, in recognition of its status as a reliable operator in the  field of customs procedures; (iii) involvement in the OECD's ICAP initiative (coordinated verification by the tax authorities of |\n|                                                              | a.ii)  Advocacy of public  policy on taxation                                    | Many of the laws and regulations on tax transparency and fiscal now in force arose from the debates and forums of  international organizations (UN, OECD, EU, etc.). Hence at Repsol we support institutional relations with these authorities  and other stakeholders to align the Company's tax policies with social reality, contribute responsibly to the creation of a fairer  and more balanced international tax framework, and enable anticipation in tax management in the face of any regulatory  changes to minimize their risks and impacts. An example of this is Repsol's involvement, sometimes on its own behalf, in the  public information regularly issued by various international organizations such as the OECD or the Platform for Collaboration  in Tax Matters (UN, OECD, IMF and World Bank). Through our engagement in these discussions (usually at the invitation of the corresponding organization), we have had the                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

Negative assessments frequently related to logistics contracts and equipment installation and maintenance. As in 2019, after these negative assessments, improvements were agreed with 100% of suppliers. We highlight that, as in the previous year, we have not terminated any supplier relationship for environmental reasons.\n\n## [414-2]: Negative social impacts on the supply chain and measures taken\n\nWe conducted 2,007 assessments (2,605 in 2019) on social issues regarding 1,056 suppliers (1,248 in 2019). We found 28 assessments (67 in 2019) corresponding to 22 suppliers (53 in 2019) with a performance rating in social aspects lower than 5 out of 10. As in 2019, negative assessments largely concerned the Code of Ethics and Human Rights. As in the previous year, after these negative assessments, improvements were agreed with 100% of suppliers. As in 2019, no supplier relationships were terminated due to social issues (e.g., human rights or labor issues).\n\n## Responsible customer management\n\n## [RT-CH-410b.2] Strategy to (1) manage hazardous chemicals and (2) develop alternatives with reduced human and/or environmental impact\n\nRepsol has internal rules in the field of safe product management that lay down the requirements to ensure suitable handling of the risks at each stage in the life cycle of a product, from design to placement on the market. The Chemicals division has rolled out these requirements through a procedure whereby:\n\nDuring product design, it is necessary to study potential adverse effects and identify uses to put in place suitable risk management measures. This stage tests whether it is necessary to seek substitute products, if technically and economically feasible.\n\nDuring procurement of raw materials and additives, information is compiled on their hazardousness and suitable measures for safe handling.\n\nDuring operations, by means of the inherently safe design of facilities, we assess operational risks and waste management.\n\nWhen products are placed on the market, customers must be provided with the necessary information for them to take steps to handle the products Repsol supplies safely.\n\nIn the Polyolefins business, two key projects are underway to replace substances that could be a concern for humans and the environment. In the phthalate-free polyolefins project, Repsol is looking for catalyst activators with which to replace the current ones. In the field of food safety, we seek to identify and replace substances in food contact materials that migrate into food at a threshold rate.\n\nElsewhere, in the range of polyol-ethers at the Intermediates business, we are working to reduce volatile organic compounds so as to improve the product that reaches the end consumer.",

(the Parent company) and investees comprising the Repsol Group (hereinafter 'Repsol' or 'the Group') which forms part of Group's consolidated management's report attached.\n\nThe content of the consolidated management report includes additional information to that required by current commercial legislation on non-financial reporting which has not been covered by our verification work. In this respect, our work has been restricted solely to verifying the information identified in Appendix V 'Statement of Non-Financial Information' and Appendix IV 'GRI Index' of the accompanying consolidated management report.\n\n## Responsibility of the directors of the Parent company\n\nThe preparation of the CNFIS included in Group's consolidated management report, and the content thereof, are responsibility of directors of Repsol, S.A. The CNFIS has been drawn up according to the provisions of current commercial legislation and with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter 'GRI Standards') in accordance with the Comprehensive option and the Oil and Gas Sector Disclosures of the GRI G4 Guidelines (hereinafter 'Oil and Gas Sector Disclosures'), in line with the details provided for each topic in the tables included in Appendix V 'Statement of Non-Financial Information' and Appendix IV 'GRI Index' of the aforementioned consolidated management report.\n\nThis responsibility also includes the design, implementation and maintenance of the internal control that is considered necessary to ensure that the CNFIS is free from material misstatement, due to fraud or error.\n\nThe directors of Repsol, S.A. are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information required to prepare the CNFIS is obtained.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence requirements and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants ('IESBA') which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.",

Our work has been aligned with the requirements set by the current International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000 Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and with the Guidelines for verification engagements on non-financial statements issued by the Spanish Institute of Auditors ('Instituto de Censores Jurados de Cuentas de Espa\u00f1a').\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed vary in terms of their nature and timing of execution and are more restricted than those carried out in a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, the assurance obtained is substantially lower.\n\nOur work has consisted of posing questions to management and several Group units that were involved in the preparation of the CNFIS, in the review of the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the CNFIS and in the application of certain analytical procedures and review sampling tests, as described below:\n\n- x Meetings with Group's personnel to ascertain the business model, policies and management approaches applied and the main risks related to these matters, and to obtain the information required for the external review.\n- x Analysis of the scope, relevance and integrity of the content included in the CNFIS for 2020 based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in section 'Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement' of Appendix III , considering the content required under current commercial legislation.\n- x Analysis of the procedures used to compile and validate the information presented in the CNFIS for 2020.\n- x Review of information concerning risks, policies and management approaches applied in relation to material issues presented in the CNFIS for 2020.\n- x Verification, through sample testing, of the information relating to the content of the CNFIS for 2020 and its adequate compilation using data supplied by the sources information.\n- x Obtainment of a management representation letter from the directors and the management of the Parent company.",
