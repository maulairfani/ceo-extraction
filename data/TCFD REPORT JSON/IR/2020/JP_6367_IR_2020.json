We are the world's only general air-conditioning equipment manufacturer with in-house divisions covering both air conditioning and refrigerants. We have continued to grow and develop based on people-centered management, the pursuit of originality, and diversity management. Based on the enterprising spirit espoused in our core values, our employees have worked in unison to take on the challenge of achieving established goals. By demonstrating the ability to fully carry out our duties, we have successfully refi ned our strengths in energy-saving and environmental as well as IAQ technologies, robust sales network, and local production for local consumption model.\n\nUnder our fi ve-year FUSION 20 strategic management plan that ended in fi scal 2020, we had adopted the two pillars of thoroughly strengthening our core businesses-air conditioning, chemicals, and fi lters-and expanding our business domains while transforming our business structure. As a result, we were able to steadily implement our key strategies while investing in growth for the future.\n\nWe are currently experiencing a once-in-a-century pandemic, and the COVID-19 crisis is causing unprecedented environmental changes and a dramatic transformation of the consumer structure. We are also experiencing major structural changes in society, such as the promotion of carbon neutrality. As the world's only manufacturer that develops and produces both air-conditioning equipment and refrigerants, we have been contributing to the environment by providing differentiated products and services that take advantage of our environmental and energy-saving technologies around the world. However, we believe that it is essential to achieve both business growth and the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nIn formulating FUSION 25, the strategic management plan that we started in fi scal 2021, we took into account the major changes in the structure of the economy, industry and society 10 to 20 years into the future, as well as the ideal state of the Daikin Group. Based on this back-casting approach, we have set specifi c themes to be addressed during the fi ve years of FUSION 25.\n\nWhile contributing to solving environmental and social issues, we will expand our business to achieve further growth and development. Our goal is to realize contributions to both a sustainable society and the growth of the Daikin Group.",

Through this report, we hope to convey the Group's aspiration and endeavors to help realize a sustainable society by balancing efforts to resolve environmental and social issues with the growth and development of its business while collaborating with customers, business partners, employees, local communities, and other stakeholders.\n\nIn the 'Process of Value Creation,' we have clearly outlined the relationship between the six types of capital and outcomes, as well as expressed our aim to achieve sustainable growth by working to solve social issues through the Group's unique strengths and business model. In the 'Risks and Opportunities That Affect Medium- to Long-Term Value Creation' section, we identifi ed important social issues that could affect the Group's medium- to long-term value creation in light of changes in the external environment, and identifi ed related risks and opportunities. In the 'Looking Back on Our Strategic Management Plan 'FUSION'' section, we summarized our efforts, achievements, and progress to date. In addition, the ''FUSION 25' Strategic Management Plan' section outlines the details of this strategic management plan that began in fi scal 2021. Under FUSION 25, our goal is to 'offer new value for the environment and air to realize both contributions to a sustainable society and Group growth' with the aim of continuing to grow and develop by expanding our business and strengthening profi tability while contributing to the environment and society. We have also set our key strategic themes, including the challenge to achieve carbon neutrality. The report outlines the specifi c measures, both fi nancial and non-fi nancial, that Daikin will take to realize its vision for fi scal 2025, the fi nal year of the plan.\n\nThis report contains information that is of particular importance to enhancing the corporate value of the Daikin Group.

        "page_content": "## Fiscal 2020 Results and FUSION 20 Overview\n\n## Achieved performance exceeding announced values due to management approach in confronting COVID-19 crisis\n\nIn fi scal 2020, the fi scal year ended March 31, 2021, amid the uncertainties in the outlook due to the spread of COVID-19, we took the management position of confronting the crisis immediately. Having established themes for 'defensive and proactive measures' and 'constitution strengthening and reform' as important issues to be tackled by the global Group as a whole, I myself have been involved in enacting six emergency projects, efforts that led to the creation of results by the entire Company. By carrying out fl exible management in response to the ever-changing situation, we were able to manage and also to achieve results that exceeded the announced values. Sales for the year in full reached \u00a52,493.4 billion, up \u00a533.4 billion against the announced forecast value but a 2.2% decrease year on year. Operating profi t came in at \u00a5238.6 billion, up \u00a56.6 billion against forecast but a 10.1% decrease year on year.\n\nAs a company that operates globally, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic has been very signifi cant, and we estimate that it has had a negative impact of approximately \u00a5350.0 billion on net sales and \u00a5150.0 billion on operating profi t. As a result, in fi scal 2020, both sales and profi ts decreased compared with previous year. However, I believe that we were able to not only secure short-term results, but also to further strengthen our management structure for future growth and development through the measures we took amid the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## Looking back at FUSION 20\n\nTo date, the Company has been aiming for sustainable development through our unique FUSION management that encapsulates the meanings of balancing short-term profi tability and long-term growth potential, collaboration with global Group companies and other companies and working together as one on development, production, sales, and services. In particular, after showing where we were aiming to be in fi ve years' time, we have produced results and have led to growth and development by clarifying the key strategies toward those goals and the quantitative targets and execution themes for the following three years.\n\nUnder FUSION 20, which ran from fi scal 2015 to fi scal 2020, we worked on the thorough implementation of a twinpronged raft of measures, that is on the one hand strengthening our core businesses-Air Conditioning, Chemicals, and Filters-and on the other hand, the expansion of our business scope and the changing of our business structure, which were adopted as priority themes. From the fourth quarter of fi scal 2019 onward, we have been greatly affected by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but even amid a severe business environment, we focused on achieving FUSION 20 and the Group as a whole tackled the diffi cult situation. I believe that we were able to secure both short-term profi ts and medium- to longterm growth by steadily implementing our key strategies while investing in growth for the future.\n\nIn 2018, we formulated our Environmental Vision 2050, which has the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero toward 2050, and accelerated the development\n\n## FUSION 20 Results\n\n|                                       | FY2016   | FY2017   | FY2018   | FY2019   | FY2020 FUSION 20 Goals Actual   | FY2020 FUSION 20 Goals Actual   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Net sales (100 million  yen)          | 20,440   | 22,906   | 24,811   | 25,503   | 29,000                          | 24,934                          |\n| Operating  profi t (100 million  yen) | 2,308    | 2,537    | 2,763    | 2,655    | 3,480                           | 2,386                           |\n| Operating  profi t margin (%)         | 11.3     | 11.1     | 11.1     | 10.4     | 12.0                            | 9.6                             |",

Under 'FUSION 25', we will further strengthen this initiative\n\nand continue to work toward the realization of a sustainable society by balancing the solving of environmental and social issues with business growth.\n\n## Management Approach to Fiscal 2021\n\nCompared with the past fi scal year, the social situation has calmed down slightly in fi scal 2021, but I feel that the uncertainties about the future will continue for the time being with no clear idea of how the situation will change. Although there are now the negative effects of lockdowns due to the reemergence of infections, there exists the possibility that the economy will recover rapidly once the infection has been put under control by the widespread use of vaccines and the effects of large-scale economic measures taken by various countries. In the current fi scal year, I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we take fl exible measures to respond to these changes in the situation according to the circumstances but with even greater speed than before. I will thus steer the management in a fl exible manner that enables us to respond quick-\n\nly to the vagaries of the business environment.\n\nThe business environment factors surrounding the Company in the current fi scal year include the uncertain impact from COVID-19, the signifi cant negative impacts brought by raw material market conditions and sharp rises in logistics costs, concerns about a slowdown in the residential air-conditioning market and a delay in the recovery of the commercial air-conditioning market, all of which are placing the Company in a diffi cult situation. Even under these circumstances, based on what we have been working on in fi scal 2020, I would like us to continue to adopt an aggressive stance and show a willingness to take on challenges toward the implementation of measures while aiming to accumulate results and achieve record-high performance.\n\n## Strategic Management Plan 'FUSION 25'\n\n## In the course of formulating Strategic Management Plan 'FUSION 25'\n\nIn formulating 'FUSION 25,' we took into account the major changes in the structure of the economy, industry, and society, and looked at the changes in the world's economy and society 10 to 20 years into the future, as well as the ideal state of the Daikin Group. Based on this back-casting approach, we have set specifi c themes to be addressed during the fi ve years of 'FUSION 25.' Unprecedented environmental changes and a dramatic transformation of the consumer structure are being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is said to be a oncein-a-century event. In addition to geopolitical changes, we are also experiencing major structural changes in society, as the world moves toward a decarbonized society, or carbon neutrality. Companies are required to have a management stance and the business strategies to win out in the new normal era.\n\nOver the next fi ve years, we will contribute to solving environmental and social issues, while expanding our business and continuing to achieve growth and development. Our goal this time is to realize both contributions to a sustainable society and to the Group's growth. We have set three themes for our growth strategy: 'challenge to achieve carbon neutrality,'\n\n'promotion of Solutions business connected with customers,' and 'creating value with air.'\n\n## Changes in business environment surrounding the Company\n\nThe fi rst major change is the growing importance of environmental and social contributions. Among the efforts to tackle various social issues, in particular the corporate responsibility to reduce CO 2 emissions and decarbonization has become a major issue.\n\nAs the world's only manufacturer of both air-conditioning equipment and refrigerants, we have been contributing to the environment by providing differentiated products and services that take advantage of our energy-saving technologies around the world and by popularizing products equipped with low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. In the years to come, however, I believe that it will be essential to achieve both business growth and the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions (carbon neutrality) by 2050.\n\nThe second point is that the values and needs of customers are changing more rapidly than ever, from goods to experiences and from ownership to use. I believe that the key to future",

        "page_content": "## Three Growth Strategy Themes\n\n## Challenge to achieve carbon neutrality\n\nAs a raft of measures toward achieving carbon neutrality, we will promote the expansion of our Heat Pump Space and Water Heating business, the further expansion of sales of energy-saving devices equipped with inverters,  the use of low-GWP refrigerants, the establishment of the refrigerant eco-cycle (recovery, reclamation and destruction), and the reduction of CO 2 emissions during the manufacturing process. In the Heat Pump Heating business, in particular, combustion-type and electric heaters are currently the mainstream in Europe and North America, and the ratio of heat pump space heating remains at around 10% of the market. By accelerating the shift to heat pump space and water heating systems in Europe and North America, which are our top priority regions, we plan to double our Heat Pump Space and Water Heating business sales by fi scal 2025 compared with fi scal 2020.\n\n## Promotion of Solutions business connected with customers\n\nIn the Air Conditioning Solutions business, we will establish a business model that provides customers with experiences while accelerating the expansion of the business. While reinforcing the service, engineering, and other business foundations we have built to date, we will work to provide new value, such as the provision of individually optimized air-conditioned spaces and improvements in comfort and safety, by directly connecting with users by application and market, such as hospitals and factories, and combining the use of equipment operation data, energy management, and IAQ technology. In addition, we will provide competitive solutions to reduce the electric power load by utilizing data through the promotion of connected devices that take advantage of our technological strength as an air-conditioning specialist to\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, with regard to refrigeration, we would like to take on the challenges in building a highly profi table business model as well as in solving social issues, such as reducing food loss, by connecting the cold chain from the production area to the consumption area.\n\n## Creating value with air\n\nSeizing the opportunity presented by demand for IAQ and ventilation, which has been growing amid the COVID-19 crisis, we will create a market for air purifi ers in each region of the world and take on the challenge of selling one million units per year in each region. In addition to creating new products and services that enrich the healthcare fi eld and daily life, we will promote collaborative creation with external parties to tackle the business of pursuing new value with air.\n\n## Execution of growth investments\n\nTo realize the 'FUSION 25' growth strategies and take advantage of the changes of the times as opportunities to expand our business, we will make aggressive investments. We are planning to invest a cumulative total of \u00a5800 billion over the next three years (a fi ve-year total of more than \u00a51.3 trillion), including capital investment and investments in R&D, digital technology, and human resources.\n\nIn addition to capital investment centered on increasing production capacity to support business expansion in each region of the world, we will concentrate our resources boldly on technological areas related to our growth strategy in R&D. In addition to strengthening our overseas R&D bases, by utilizing collaborative creation inside and outside the Company as well as by reforming our development process utilizing digital technology, we will advance environmental technologies, such as heat pumps and next-generation refrigerants, and create differentiated products one after another.  I also believe that it will be essential to acquire and develop the talented human resources who will provide the driving force behind these innovations. Expanding our digital investments is not only designed to accelerate business innovation, such as the promotion of our data-driven Solutions business and the creation of air value. This time, they will also promote process innovation that will lead to a shortening of development lead times, thereby improving supply chain effi ciency and to strengthen our management foundation.\n\nAlthough M&A have not been factored into the quantitative targets (for sales, operating profi t, and investment plans) at this time, we are actively promoting alliances, collaborations, and M&A to increase the speed of our business expansion. In particular, the areas that we want to focus on are heating and refrigeration service companies in Europe, service and engineering companies to expand our Solutions business in Asia and North America, and sales and wholesale companies to strengthen Goodman's sales network. At this point, we are currently envisioning M&A totaling approximately \u00a5600 billion over the next three years.\n\n## Efforts to improve profi tability of mainstay businesses\n\nTo invest in the growth strategy themes and thereby expand our business, it is essential to further strengthen the profi tability of our existing businesses. Above all else, we will promptly work to raise the profi tability of the Air Conditioning business in North America.\n\nI believe that we have been able to increase the competitiveness of our North American Air Conditioning business in terms of sales, production, and products through the aggressive investments we have made so far but, on the other hand, we are still in the process of recovering our investments. Under 'FUSION 25,' we will strive to achieve an operating profi t margin of 10% or higher in fi scal 2025 while making further investments in growth to become the number one air-conditioner manufacturer in North America.\n\nOn the one hand, a US-based competitor is accelerating its business expansion by initiatives that include becoming a specialized air-conditioning company. On the other hand, however, it is expected that energy-saving regulations will become more stringent and environmental policies will be strengthened, and thus we will take the initiative in changing the market by converting to inverters, heat pumps, and low-GWP refrigerants, which are our strengths.\n\nAt Goodman, we are expanding our business in the residential market and promoting the conversion to inverters by increasing sales of premium products as well as increasing productivity in Goodman's factory. At Daikin Applied Americas Inc., we plan to expand earnings by fully developing our Solutions business in the applied market.\n\nIn Japan, we will aim to become the top company in all areas in the residential, commercial, and IAQ and ventilation businesses. At the same time, we will accelerate our growth by utilizing data to expand the Solutions business.\n\nIn Europe, we will not only engage in equipment sales in all the fi elds of air conditioning, space and water heating, applied,",

China is one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world, and we have been working to build a business model that includes sales and marketing activities that utilize digital technology. In addition to hybrid sales activities that combine our unique strengths, such as offl ine sales via PROSHOP and online sales activities, we will work to expand sales by system proposals that, for example, bundle ventilation and air purifi cation with IAQ sensors. In terms of production,\n\n## Responses to Social Issues\n\nThe last fi ve years have also been a period of major changes in the structure of the economy, industry, and society. Their pace having been faster and the extent of the shift greater than expected, those changes are exerting an infl uence in a variety of ways, from the business activities of the Group to the way we lead our own lives. Due to the increasing importance being placed on environmental and social contributions, companies are also required not only to pursue profi ts but also to help solve social issues set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWe have set a quantitative target under 'FUSION 25' because we believe that it is our top priority to further acceler-\n\n## Shareholder Returns\n\nAs a company that is expanding its business on a global basis, fi scal 2020 turned into a year in which Daikin was greatly affected by the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although sales and profi ts decreased compared with the previous fi scal year, as a result of the Group working together as one to tackle important issues, we were able to achieve results that exceeded the announced values and thus paid a year-end dividend of \u00a5160 per share, in line with what had been previously announced.\n\nBased on our nimble yet robust management structure cultivated in the fi scal year under review, in fi scal 2021 we will continue to implement measures while adopting an aggressive stance and showing a willingness to take on challenges to secure double-digit sales and profi t growth. We will aim for a\n\nwe will also aim for a state-of-the-art smart factory that utilizes digital technology.\n\nConcerning the Air Conditioning business in Asia, which is expected to display the world's greatest market growth, we would like to establish an overwhelming number one position there. In India in particular, we would like to expand our business in the future and make it a major base of operations. We will strengthen our local production system, sales network, and product development to expand sales of energy-effi cient products and services while taking the lead in the market's shift to inverters and low-GWP refrigerants (R32).\n\nate our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of our products, as efforts to realize a decarbonized society are spreading worldwide.\n\nThe global air-conditioning market is expected to triple in size in the 30-year period to 2050 in step with the economic development of emerging countries and other factors. In 2018, we declared in our Environmental Vision 2050 by which we aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Under 'FUSION 25' we will further strengthen our efforts to not only fulfi ll our social responsibilities, but also to achieve business growth, making it sustainable.\n\nV-shaped recovery in earnings that surpasses our pre-COVID performance. In fi scal 2021, we are planning to pay an annual dividend of \u00a5180 per share, comprising interim and year-end dividends both of \u00a590.\n\nOn the basis of our implementing stable and continuous dividend payments, in the future as we have in the past we will strive to maintain a ratio of dividends to shareholder equity (DOE) of 3% or higher and at the same time also aim for an increasingly higher level of dividend payout ratio. In addition, we will expand our business while making upfront investment for further growth and development and strive to further enhance shareholder returns by increasing corporate value and increasing market capitalization.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Strategy\n\n## Deepening and Promoting 'Ratio Management' Company Wide\n\n## Capital Cost-Oriented Financial Strategy\n\nDaikin undertakes 'ratio management' focusing on capital costs to increase corporate value. The background behind introducing 'ratio management' started with our intention to pivot away from emphasizing monetary amounts (i.e., net sales, operating profi t) on P/L statements, aiming to become global No. 1 under 'FUSION' launched in 1996. We then began 'ratio  management' to focus more on operating profi t 'margin,' profi tability, and fi nancial structure based on our aim to 'become an attractive company that draws together people, capital, and information' under the revamped FUSION in 1999.\n\n'Ratio management' involves overseeing 'profi tability, cash, and fi nancial structure' as a set using indicators such as free cash fl ow and DVA* 1 along with ROE and ROA. Regarding DVA, we have shifted to ROIC (return on invested capital) and free cash fl ow as management indicators for each division in recent years, as all segments have reached the black.\n\n- *1  DVA: Daikin economic value added\n\nWe adopted DVA with the start of ratio management as an indicator that resonates easily by simplifying and fostering employee understanding of EVA (economic value added). Beyond simplifying the calculation formula, we focused on promoting DVA internally by explaining DVA to employees in terms of corporate value rising when profi ts generated from business activities over an entire year exceed capital costs.\n\n## ROIC Tree\n\n## Companywide ROIC Tree\n\nROIC was introduced as an internal management indicator to monitor capital effi ciency beginning with reducing inventories and to facilitate greater implementation among employees.\n\nMore specifi cally, we have positioned ROIC as an internal management indicator linked to Companywide ROE targets and then apply it to each business target as a means to specifi cally show how ROIC is connected to the duties of each employee. For example, during employee training we describe ROIC as a tree to explain concepts such as how  inventory reduction improves ROIC and the relationship between selling prices and costs to increase profi tability. In addition to staff in Japan, we use the 'ROIC Tree' concept to explain to the employees of overseas bases how ROIC is linked to their daily duties.\n\nWe promoted 10 key Companywide themes essential for achieving FUSION 20 fi nal year targets; 1-7 listed below show the connection between seven of those themes and the ROIC Tree. In addition, given the uncertain outlook from amid the COVID-19 pandemic of fi scal 2020, we are undertaking ROIC Tree-linked measures, namely six emergency projects that address important management issues as well as strategic 7 themes to be raised for fi scal 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial Analysis over the Past Decade\n\nDaikin achieved a V-shaped recovery amid major economic changes following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, achieving ten consecutive years of sales growth from fi scal 2010 through fi scal 2019 and nine consecutive years of operating profi t for nine years straight through to fi scal 2018. This breakthrough earnings growth refl ects Daikin's penetration of the North American air-conditioning market after acquiring major US air-conditioning manufacturer Goodman in 2012. In addition, we position operating profi t margin as an indicator of profi tability under Ratio Management and set a target of 12.0% as the  target of FUSION 20. While the operating profi t margin rose to 11.1% in fi scal 2018, buffeted by the impact of COVID-19, actual results for fi scal 2020 amounted to 9.6%.

In the Chemicals business, we intend to proactively invest in production capacity expansion in China and the U.S. to meet the increasing demand for semiconductors and batteries. However, due to the uncertain outlook caused by COVID-19, we will keep a closer eye on determining priorities, timing of implementation, and amount of investments.\n\nUnder FUSION 25, we will continue aggressive investments\n\nto realize our growth strategies and to leverage the changing times as opportunities for business growth. Covering capital investments, as well as investments into R&D, digital technology, and human resources, we plan to invest a cumulative total of \u00a5800 billion over the three-year period from fi scal 2021 to fi scal 2023 and a cumulative \u00a51.3 trillion over the fi ve-year period to fi scal 2025. Moreover, we envision M&A activities cumulatively amounting to approximately \u00a5600 billion over three years.\n\nAs for shareholder returns, by striving to maintain a consolidated ratio of dividend to net assets (Dividend on Equity, DOE) of 3.0% while at the same time aiming for an even higher consolidated dividend payout ratio, we will introduce initiatives to further increase returns to our shareholders with the core goal of stable and continuous dividends. In fi scal 2020, the annual dividend was set at \u00a5160.

However, given the well-entrenched culture of ducted air conditioning, market entry proved diffi cult and a withdrawal was unavoidable. We subsequently revisited the idea of establishing a U.S. presence\n\nduring our advance to establish business globally, and in the 2000s, with the acquisition of the O.Y.L. Industries Bhd and Goodman Global Group, Inc., added ducted air-conditioning products to our lineup marking the start of full-fl edged operations in the U.S.\n\n## Current status\n\n## Market Environment\n\nThe air-conditioning market in the U.S., having reached maturity, is based mainly on replacement demand. In fi scal 2021, government economic measures and strong personal spending bolstered the economy, and demand was steady in the housing market.\n\n## Business Conditions\n\nIn ducted unitary for houses, supply tightened due to a suspension of operations at the Goodman factory put in place in April to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the subsequent impact of a shortage of manufacturing personnel.

We carry out decision-making with foresight, as well as by executing business with greater speed, transparency, and soundness in response to challenges and changes in the business environment.\n\nWe strive to improve our current integrated management framework, under which directors assume responsibility for both business execution and management. In this way, we fulfi ll our responsibility for management, making strategic decisions quickly and providing appropriate supervision. We also improve the monitoring function conducted by third parties, including multiple external directors.\n\nWe aim for management with greater speed, soundness, and transparency. We will continue to boost corporate value by seeking and implementing new ways to achieve optimal corporate governance, pursuing best practices in all facets and at all levels of the Daikin Group.\n\nRegarding Japan's Corporate Governance Code set by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Daikin has already implemented all the principles contained in the revisions of June 1, 2018, including 'enhancing information disclosure,' 'maintaining the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board,' 'defi ning roles and responsibilities of independent external directors,' and 'the policy of having constructive dialogue with shareholders.' Going forward, Daikin will continue to enhance these initiatives.\n\n## Management and Operational Execution System\n\nRather than adopting a U.S.-style 'committee system' that completely separates decision making and business oversight from operational execution, the Daikin Group has adopted an 'integrated management system' in its aim to promote a higher level of management, in view of the special characteristics of the Group's business and in judging that this is a more-effective means of accelerating decision making and operational execution. 'Integrated management' means that the directors jointly take charge of both management responsibilities and business execu-\n\ntion responsibilities.\n\nDirectors also bear responsibility for the execution and completion of their own decisions by carrying out their decision making, business execution, and supervision/guidance in an 'integrated' manner. The multiple external directors provide monitoring of the status of business execution from an independent perspective and take responsibility to support 'integrated management' from the standpoint of transparency and integrity by offering appropriate oversight and advice with regard to decision making. In addition, the Group has introduced an 'executive offi cer system' to accelerate the speed of execution based on autonomous judgments and directions in units handling each region, division, and function. Appointments of executive offi cers are carried out by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Appointment of Directors\n\nWhen appointing directors, the Daikin Group gives emphasis to factors ranging from the globalization of the Group's businesses and the broadening of its business fi elds to a diverse range of background factors, such as nationality, gender, and career history.\n\nAs of the end of June 2021, there were 11 directors (including one female and one non-Japanese directors) who carry out expeditious and strategic decision making as well as sound oversight and guidance throughout the Group.\n\nDaikin's Board of Directors includes four external directors (as of the end of June 2021), conditional upon them not having a confl ict of interest with the Company. Daikin seeks external directors that can provide oversight and advice from a high-level perspective based on a wealth of experience and deep insight. Accordingly, Daikin appoints external directors with business experience, mainly as directors at listed companies, and that do not hold concurrent external director positions at fi ve or more companies.\n\nTo ensure that the external directors can effectively contribute to Daikin's corporate governance system, assistants to the external directors are assigned in the Company. They strive to provide the external directors with information, early notice of Board of Directors meetings, and prior notice of Board of Directors meeting agenda items, as well as implementing prior explanations of particularly important agenda items. In addition, when external directors are unable to attend a Board of Directors meeting, the assistants provide them with related materials and subsequent explanations of meeting proceedings.\n\n## Audit System\n\nDaikin employs an Audit and Supervisory Board System and has established the Audit and Supervisory Board. As of the end of June 2021, Daikin's four Audit and Supervisory Board members included two external Audit and Supervisory Board members. The principal nomination criteria for external Audit and Supervisory Board members are the same as those for external directors and include independence from the Company in terms of not having a confl ict of interest with the Company.\n\nAudit and Supervisory Board members attend meetings of the Board of Directors, as well as other important meetings, and receive reports. In addition, they can express diverse opinions.\n\nTo ensure effective audit functions, the Audit and Supervisory Board receives reports on important issues related to management and performance when necessary and also investigates relevant units, confi rms approval of documents, and regularly exchanges opinions with representative directors, executive offi cers, and the accounting auditors. In addition, the Audit and Supervisory Board Member Offi ce has been established, and the staff perform their duties under the orders and direction of Audit and Supervisory Board members. The opinions of the Audit and Supervisory Board are respected on matters related to personnel transfers, work evaluations, and other matters pertaining to Audit and Supervisory Board Member Offi ce staff.\n\n## Corporate Governance Structure (as of the end of June 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agile Management Support System\n\nDaikin's three main management bodies are the Board of Directors, the Group Steering Meeting, and the Executive Offi cers Meeting and by keeping the number of directors at a minimum they secure expeditious decision making based on substantial discussion.\n\nThe Board of Directors, along with providing healthy business execution and appropriate supervision and guidance, is the decision-making institution for all matters related to the Group as a whole, as stipulated by laws and regulations as well as the Company's Articles of Incorporation, and for other important management matters.

In fi scal 2020, the Group Steering Meeting was held six times.\n\nThe Executive Offi cers Meeting was established as a place where we can expedite thorough deliberations and prompt implementation of important management issues, and it met 20 times in fi scal 2020.\n\nIn addition, to respect and protect the interests of diverse stakeholders other than stockholders, Daikin has, based on the Board of Directors, established its Internal Control Committee, Corporate Ethics and Risk Management Committee, Information Disclosure Committee, and CSR Committee.\n\n## Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nDaikin analyzes the effectiveness and appropriateness of the Board of Directors and the corporate governance system through interviews with the directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members and deliberations by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of the Company is assessed as 'making appropriate decisions through open and active discussions, and playing an effective role in enhancing corporate value over the medium to long term.' We will continue to improve Board effectiveness, as well as engage in other initiatives, including discussions of cross-Group strategies and issues and enhanced reports of the status of business execution.\n\n## Corporate Offi cer Remuneration\n\nTo ensure the transparent management of its corporate offi cer personnel and remuneration processes, Daikin has established the HRM Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee. These committees engage in discussions and deliberations regarding issues including corporate offi cer nomination criteria, candidates, and remuneration. As of July 2021, both committees comprised six members, including four external directors, one in-house director, and one executive offi cer in charge of personnel, with the committee chairman being chosen from the external directors.\n\nThe Compensation Advisory Committee reports its opinion to the Chairman of the Board of Directors within the maximum limit authorized at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors determines the remuneration of directors after receiving approval to reappointment from the Board of Directors. Remuneration for Audit and Supervisory Board members is determined through discussions among Audit and Supervisory Board members within the maximum limit determined by a resolution at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn response to the expectations of shareholders and in accordance with management policy, offi cer compensation is structured to motivate offi cers to continuously improve their performance over the medium to long term, and to contribute to increasing the value of the entire Group. Compensation for directors, excluding external directors, consists of fi xed compensation, performance-linked remuneration that refl ects short-term Group performance and the performance of the division in which a director is in charge, and stock compensation-type stock options that refl ect medium- to long-term performance. In addition, the performance-linked ratio is set higher than the market rate to ensure suffi cient incentives for performance improvement. External directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members receive fi xed compensation only.\n\nDaikin determines compensation levels based on the relative position of its performance and remuneration levels compared to other leading manufacturing companies in Japan after reviewing objective data from a specialized external institution on the remuneration of corporate offi cers active in approximately 300 Japanese\n\ncompanies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In specifi c terms, the three indices used by the Company are the sales growth rate, operating income margin and ROE, as well as the medium-to-long term increase in corporate value.\n\nRegarding performance-linked compensation for directors other than external directors, three performance-linked indicators by which to assess Companywide performance: net sales, operating income margin, and operating income have been selected. These indicators have a clear and mutual relation to Daikin Industries' numerical management targets. Further, these indicators facilitate comparison with the performance of other companies in the industry. Net sales and operating income margin are calculated according to single-year performance versus budget. Operating income is calculated according to growth linked to medium- and long-term management plans.\n\nPerformance-linked compensation for the chairman and president uses a performance-linked coeffi cient derived from Companywide performance-linked indicators. Performance-linked compensation for directors other than the chairman or president is determined using a performance-linked coeffi cient derived from Companywide performance-linked indicators, adjusted by single-year performance versus budget for net sales and operating income for their respective divisions (serving as indicators that represent the targets of the work that each division carries out daily) and individual priority initiatives carried out over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nThe number of compensatory stock options paid to directors excluding external directors is determined each fi scal year by dividing a sum determined by taking into account the status and results of each individual's efforts on short-term, medium- and long-term priority issues in the previous fi scal year and that is based upon the standard for each position, by the average closing price of the most recent share price. These are exercisable from three to 12 years after the date of grant.\n\n## Total Compensation for Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members (Fiscal 2020)\n\n|                                                                                                |                                        | Total of different types of compensation  (Millions of yen)   | Total of different types of compensation  (Millions of yen)   | Total of different types of compensation  (Millions of yen)   | Persons  paid   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Position                                                                                       | Total  Compensation  (Millions of yen) | Fixed  compensation                                           | Stock  Options                                                | Performance- linked  compensation                             | Persons  paid   |\n| Directors (excluding  external directors)                                                      | 1,217                                  | 518                                                           | 178                                                           | 520                                                           | 8               |\n| Audit and Supervisory  Board Members  (excluding external  Audit & Supervisory  Board members) | 70                                     | 70                                                            | -                                                             | -                                                             | 2               |\n| External Corporate  Offi cers                                                                  | 92                                     | 92                                                            | -                                                             | -                                                             | 6               |\n\n## Accounting Auditor Compensation (Fiscal 2020)\n\n## Group-Wide Governance\n\nTo meet governance needs on a Groupwide basis, including companies acquired through M&A, Daikin holds meetings of the Group Steering Meeting to ensure the thorough sharing of important management policies and basic strategies. Moreover, Daikin aims for corporate action based on unifi ed Group objectives by promoting and strengthening support for the resolution of challenges of Group companies. In addition, to strengthen Group-based auditing and supervisory functions, Daikin is working to enhance its management at the Group Auditors Meetings, which comprise audit managers from major Group companies.

        "page_content": "## Message from the External Director\n\nThe Daikin Group strives to raise corporate value through corporate governance. We carry out decision-making with foresight, as well as by executing business with greater speed, transparency, and soundness in response to challenges and changes in the business environment.\n\nThis year we spoke with Tatsuo Kawada, one of the Group's external directors, about his thoughts on the characteristics of Daikin's Board of Directors and his expectations for the strategic management plan 'FUSION 25.'\n\n## Open and Active Discussions Unique to Daikin\n\n## Tatsuo Kawada\n\nExternal Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTatsuo Kawada is the Chairman of Seiren Co., Ltd. During his many years as manager of this comprehensive textile manufacturer, he has succeeded in changing the company's business model, creating innovation, and transforming the corporate culture. He has abundant experience and a high level of insight as a corporate manager. He has served as an external director of the Group since 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Characteristics and Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nI feel that the Group's Board of Directors is committed to appropriate decision-making through open and active discussions based on the concept of 'integrated management.' Under this concept, the Board members assume responsibility for both business execution and management, where they fulfi ll these responsibilities by coordinating on all aspects of management through rapid strategic decision-making and through sound, appropriate supervision.\n\nMy most important mission as an external director is to verify and ensure that decisions made by the Board of Directors are without question appropriate and relevant. In addition to sharing an outline of the agenda with the external directors prior to each Board meeting, the Group provides explanations on particularly important items ahead of time, which allows me to further deepen my understanding of these issues. Moreover, I feel that the meetings are extremely open because the Board's chairperson directs the proceedings in a manner that always provides an opportunity for participants to comment.\n\nAs a global corporation, the way in which the Group broadcasts its environmental initiatives will also become extremely important in the future. Although the Board of Directors has already decided to endorse the TCFD and is investigating specifi c measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in each business, I believe the Board of Directors will become more effective as it continues to discuss CSR and SDGs activities in a manner that includes goals.\n\nAnd as a Global Excellent Company, I look forward to the Board of Directors becoming increasingly engaged through more expansive deliberations on cross-Group strategies and issues, as well as through more detailed reports on addressing risk, for example.\n\n## Strategic Management Plan 'FUSION 25'\n\n'FUSION 25' illustrates the Group's growth strategies in terms of both fi nancial and non-fi nancial aspects, including 'Challenge to Achieve Carbon Neutrality,' 'Promotion of Solutions Business Connected with Customers,' and 'Creating Value with Air.' I also believe the Plan is extremely clear in conveying its intent to solve social problems in light of the COVID-19 pandemic while growing the business, and therefore expect to see the Group achieve sustained growth and development into the future.\n\nIn contrast to Japan with its declining population, developing countries in Southeast Asia and other regions, as well as Africa, are likely to see further growth in the air-conditioning market. However, I felt, and therefore pointed out, that the Plan contained too few descriptions of specifi c initiatives regarding the strategy for developing countries and Africa during the formulation and review stages. Ultimately, in addition to covering the establishment of a dominant position in regions with existing business operations, the Plan mentioned strengthening the foundation in developing countries and Africa, so I expect to see specifi c developments here.\n\nAlong with the recent manifestation of industrial competition and trade competition between nations, I have also come to recognize the importance of increasing the Group's risk sensitivity as a global company and of refl ecting this in medium-term planning, so I intend to monitor future developments in this area.",

On top of this, the Corporate Ethics and Risk Management Committee promotes the management of operational risk and thorough compliance.\n\nChaired by the offi cer in charge of corporate ethics and compliance, the Corporate Ethics and Risk Management Committee is comprised of each department head and the presidents of major Group companies in Japan. In principle, the Committee meets twice a year to identify issues that need to be strengthened and promote their resolution, and to report on the status of initiatives at overseas Group companies.\n\nSteps are also taken to formulate and develop comprehensive common rules to tackle compliance and risk management for overseas Group companies.\n\nThe Daikin Group established its Group Conduct Guidelines that clearly outline required conduct for individual officers and employees and appointed a Compliance and Risk Management Leader (CRL) for each division and each of the main Group companies in Japan and overseas to ensure thorough compliance. By regularly checking the status of compliance and risk management, sharing information, and disseminating these Guidelines, every effort is being made to foster 'culture free of compliance violations' and to elevate 'mechanisms to ensure that there are no compliance violations.'\n\nIn fi scal 2020, compliance meetings were held in Asia, Oceania, Europe, and China to share information on self-assessment as well as on education and training initiatives.\n\n## Self Assessment System to Check the Status of Conduct Guidelines Compliance\n\nOnce a year, Daikin uses its unique self assessment system to ensure that the Group is in thorough compliance with the Group Conduct Guidelines. Using self assessments, employees check their own actions based on the Group Conduct Guidelines. Drawing on the results, employees identify issues for the organization and put in place countermeasures. The issues identifi ed and countermeasures are reported to and shared with the Corporate Ethics and Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Identifi cation of Important Risks and Planning and Implementation of Countermeasures\n\nWith the rapid expansion of the Group's business, the Daikin Group has introduced risk management across the Group to gain an overall picture of risks from a global perspective in an accurate and prompt manner and to reduce risks. Every year, each division and main Group companies overseas and in Japan identify critical risks through risk assessments. Based on the fi ndings, each Group company puts forward and implements countermeasures and works diligently to reduce these risks. The status of each company's risk reduction measures is shared with and reported to the Corporate Ethics and Risk Management Committee. For example, in fi scal 2020, Daikin Industries made efforts toward key themes such as 'Information management risk,' 'Economic security risk,' 'Quality risk,' 'Natural disaster risk,' 'Strengthening overseas crisis management functions,' and 'Harassment prevention.'\n\n## Corporate Ethics and Risk Management\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Establishing a Robust Supply Chain\n\nWe are working to further solidifying our supply system while uncertainties such as global supply chain disruptions and increasing decoupling on a global scale are rapidly growing.\n\nTo that end, we are taking steps to shift to region-based procurement to achieve local production for local consumption and establish concurrent production and backup systems to\n\navoid risks. In addition, we aim to centralize supply chain information utilizing digital tools to realize optimized SCM. The introduction and use of simulation tools will enable us to respond to demand fl uctuations, make more sophisticated decisions in the event of abnormalities, and achieve overall optimal planning.\n\n## Making practical use of solutions that support the planning and execution of optimal production and sales plans that respond immediately to changes in demand\n\nAs part of IoT-based collaboration with Hitachi, Ltd., Daikin has applied Hitachi Group's SCM optimization simulation technology* 1 in the Company's Chemicals business to put into practical use solutions that support the planning and implementation of optimal production and sales plans that respond immediately to demand fl uctuations. Until now, manufacturing and sales measures-such as which products to produce, how much and at which locations, and where to sell them-had to be formulated manually by those in charge, making the process very time-consuming. Based on the supply-demand balance of multiple manufacturing and sales bases, this solution can automatically present manufacturing/sales measures and production plans that are optimized to maximize key performance indicators (KPIs) including for sales and profi ts. We have confi rmed that it is possible to create about 60 times as many patterns in a short period of time as conventional methods, and that the time required for decision making can be reduced by about 95% since consensus can be formed quickly based on quantitative simulation results* 2 . Going forward, we will continue to use digital technology to enhance the sophistication of ECM and SCM.\n\nSupporting the planning and execution of production and sales plans by connecting global manufacturing and sales bases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1  Technology that simulates optimal production bases, production volume, sales volume, and total costs, etc., using mathematical optimization methods developed by Hitachi Solutions, Ltd.\n- *2  Survey examples during the Daikin and Hitachi demonstration. The number of patterns created per unit of time, and the time to determine whether production is possible after demand is known.\n\n## Promoting Digital Transformation for Innovation\n\nWe will work to create new products, services, and business models and fundamental business process innovations with signifi cantly enlarged digital investments.\n\nWe will build a platform for linking and analyzing data to expand the Solutions business as well as a system to manage customer information and utilize it to offer value throughout the AC equipment lifecycle. In addition, we will increase connected equipment to obtain equipment data as well as obtain data on people, buildings, and others that lead to future busi-\n\nness development through external collaboration. Furthermore, we will reform processes for ECM, SCM, and development, construct systems for upgrading the management foundation, and increase the effi ciency of indirect operations using robotic process automation and AI.\n\nTo promote such digital transformation, we will pursue the development of 1,500 human resources in digital fi elds through the Daikin Information and Communications Technology College and other initiatives.\n\n## Selected for 'DX Stocks 2020'\n\nThe Company was selected as one of the 'Digital Transformation Stocks (DX Stocks) 2020' by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 'DX Stocks' category selects companies that are actively engaged in 'DX' activities, such as using data and digital technologies to transform their products, services and business models, as well as radically reforming their business processes.\n\nWe are actively pursuing the use of AI/IoT technology to provide high-value-added air-conditioning to society. For example, we launched the spatial data co-creation platform 'CRESNECT' with partner companies. As its fi rst project, we opened the co-working space 'point 0 Marunouchi' in 2019. Combining the Company's cutting-edge technology, data, and expertise, we are conducting fi eld tests aimed at creating 'offi ce spaces of the future' that will improve productivity and maintain health. Looking ahead, we will continue to create innovations that help solve social issues by steadily advancing DX through collaborative creation both internally and externally.\n\nLecture at the Daikin Information and Communications Technology College\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year marks the eighth time overall and the seventh consecutive year that Daikin has been selected.\n\nAs an air-conditioning manufacturer with global business operations, Daikin allows the use of some of its patents by other companies in order to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases for the industry overall. For example, Daikin granted free access worldwide to 93 patents related to air-conditioning equipment utilizing R32, a refrigerant with low global warming potential (GWP). Since 2019, Daikin has expanded the scope of patents and pledged the non-assertion of those patents to support conversion to refrigerants with high energy savings and low GWP. In recognition of these efforts, Daikin was awarded the 'Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award' at the Intellectual Property Achievement Awards for fi scal 2020 conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Japan Patent Offi ce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDaikin will continue to work on R&D activities for creating innovation that provides new value to society as it further strengthens the intellectual property activities that support them.\n\n## Improving HR Capabilities through Advanced Diversity Management\n\nResponding to the changing times, we will further refi ne our corporate culture and organizational DNA based on 'people-centered management'-which is the foundation of our growth and development-and will work to ensure that such initiatives are thoroughly implemented and take hold Groupwide. We will develop human resource measures that\n\nenable all employees around the world to maximize their diverse individuality and unlimited potential for growth. As the impact of COVID-19 changes the way we work and live, we will fl exibly respond to the 'new normal' in order to create new value and achieve further growth and development.\n\n## Granted 'Nadeshiko Brand' Designation in Fiscal 2020 for the Eighth Time over Seven Consecutive Years\n\nThe Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) jointly selects and publicizes TSE-listed enterprises that are outstanding in terms of maximizing the talents of women in the workplace under the 'Nadeshiko Brand.' Daikin was granted the Nadeshiko Brand designation in fi scal 2020, marking the eighth time over seven consecutive years.\n\nDaikin considers diversity management to be a pillar of its management approach. In particular, we have been working on maximizing the talents of women under a project directly controlled by top management that was launched in 2011. In fi scal 2020, the number of female managers and the ratio of female employees increased, as did the number of candidates for management positions. We have been steadily expanding the scope of our activities through a series of concrete measures. The proactive nature of these efforts was evaluated highly, and we believe that this led to the Company being granted the 'Nadeshiko Brand' designation.\n\nWe have also formulated an action plan for maximizing the talents of women toward the end of fi scal 2025, setting quantitative goals such as increasing the number of female executives appointed internally to at least one position and the number of female managers to 120, as well as maintaining a parental leave utilization rate of at least 90% for both men and women.\n\nGoing forward, we will accelerate our efforts to promote diversity management with the aim of creating an environment where every employee can demonstrate their full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n## Summary of the Period\n\nDuring the fi scal year ended March 31, 2021, the overall world economy slowed signifi cantly as economic activity stagnated due to the global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). While some countries saw a recovery, there were also regions where the infection spread again, prolonging the impact of the disease. Although the U.S. economy slowed due to a decline in personal consumption in the fi rst half of the period, there were signs of a recovery from the second half as government economic measures and strong online sales laid the groundwork for increased consumption. The European economy was supported by a recovery in exports, despite the continued slowdown in personal consumption attributable to prolonged restrictions on activities. In the economies of Asia and emerging countries, domestic demand was sluggish due to restrictions on activities, but there were signs of economic recovery, helped by gains in exports and government spending. The Chinese economy continued a recovery trend buoyed by the quick resumption of economic activities and increases in exports and government infrastructure investment in the information and telecommunication as well as energy sectors. Despite export gains to China and a recovery in production activities, sluggish personal consumption placed downward pressure on the Japanese economy.\n\nAmid this environment, the Daikin Group launched cross-divisional projects, and focused on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of business operations, including production, procurement, and sales. In particular, the Group worked to develop and launch new products related to air quality, such as air purifi ers and ventilation products, by capitalizing on the growing awareness for the safety and assurance of indoor air quality and air environments. In addition, while procurement from sales networks, production sites, and suppliers was affected in each country, the Group worked to maintain its product supply system. Although market environments vary according to country and region, sales are returning to a recovery trend, particularly in residential air-conditioning equipment.\n\nIn addition, the Daikin Group set 'Accelerating Our 3 Structures of Collaborative Innovation, Let Us Win in this Era of Change' (3 Structures of Collaborative Innovation: Collaborative Innovation with Customers, Collaborative\n\n## Domestic and Overseas Sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInnovation with External Bodies, and Collaborative Innovation within the Group) as the slogan for its Annual Group Policy for 2020. The Group made efforts to strengthen sales and marketing capabilities; foster new product development; build fl exible production and procurement systems; improve quality; enhance human resources capabilities; and reduce both fi xed and variable costs in each region around the world.\n\nIn the fi scal year under review, the Daikin Group's net sales fell to \u00a52,493.4 billion (a year-on-year decrease of 2.2%). As for profi ts, consolidated operating income dropped to \u00a5238.6 billion (a decline of 10.1% from the previous fi scal year). Net income attributable to owners of the parent decreased 8.5%, to \u00a5156.3 billion.\n\n## Performance by Business Segment\n\n## Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment\n\nTotal sales of the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment segment decreased 1.5% from the previous fi scal year, to \u00a52,273.8 billion. Operating income declined 5.5% year on year, to \u00a5223.1 billion.\n\n## \u00b7 Japan\n\nIn the Japanese commercial air-conditioning equipment market, industry demand declined, particularly in the market for stores, due to the spread of COVID-19. As air quality needs rose for ventilation and disinfection, the Daikin Group expanded its proposals for air environments using systems that combine air-conditioning equipment and ventilation equipment. This includes the launch of new products in the 'Heat Reclaim Ventilator' lineup, high-performance ventilation equipment that can ventilate a room without affecting the room's temperature. The Group strengthened its efforts to convey its value to the market in order to meet expectations as an air-conditioner manufacturer, such as by developing 'untact' sales utilizing online activities, stimulating demand through advertising focused on ventilation and disinfection, and opening an 'Air Consultation Service' to directly answer customer concerns. However, net sales of commercial air-conditioning systems were lower year on year due to factors including reduced demand.\n\n## Operating Income and Operating Income Margin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net Income Attributable to Owners of the Parent\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In the Japanese residential air-conditioning equipment market, industry demand for both room air conditioners and air purifi ers exceeded the previous fi scal year because of demand for additional purchases of air-conditioning equipment due to changes in residential applications including remote work, as well as growth in demand for home appliances due to people spending more time at home. The Group responded to market needs by launching a series of high value-added products utilizing proprietary technologies, such as the Streamer disinfection unit, waterless humidifi cation, and room air conditioner air supply ventilation, including the room air conditioners 'Urusara X' and 'Ururu Sarara Air Purifi er.' Additionally, despite disruptions to its supply chain caused by COVID-19, the Group worked to maintain a stable supply system and increased sales. Through these efforts, the Group's net sales of residential air-conditioning systems increased year on year.\n\n## \u00b7 Americas Region\n\nIn the Americas, net sales decreased year on year as a whole due to the impact of COVID-19. Residential air-conditioning system demand was positively affected by people spending more time at home, increased adoption of remote work, and favorable weather conditions. However, net sales declined year on year as the pandemic took hold throughout the United States, which contributed to tight supply as a result of the temporary closure of factories. Net sales of commercial air-conditioning systems also declined year on year due to the review and suspension of projects in the retail and restaurant as well as certain other industries. In the market for large buildings (Applied Systems), the Group worked to strengthen its sales network and expand sales of ventilation products, particularly of rooftop units and air-handling units (large commercial air-conditioning systems that meet a wide variety of air-conditioning needs depending on the type of business and room application). Despite these endeavors, net sales fell below the level of the previous fi scal year due to a slowdown in the market caused by the spread of infection.\n\n## \u00b7 China\n\nIn China, the Group strengthened its lineup of air and ventilation products to meet the changes in the market and expanded online sales. In April and May, there was some impact from sales activities restrictions, but sales recovered from July\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sales by Segment\n\nonwards, and annual net sales exceeded the previous fi scal year. The Group maintained a high level of profi ts by reducing fi xed costs and promoting cost reductions. Recovery was rapid for residential air-conditioning systems, and the Group expanded sales by developing sales that combined the Internet with its 'PROSHOP' specialty shops, and simultaneously strengthening online sales in order to capture new customers and demand for replacements. In the commercial retail market where recovery in demand was slow for stores and offi ces, the Group expanded customer contact points by leveraging ventilation and cleaning and captured replacement as well as additional demand. In the large-scale projects market, the Group promoted collaboration with major developers in order to secure net sales. In the Applied Systems air-conditioning equipment market, the Group strengthened sales in growth fi elds, such as infrastructure, data centers and other information-related businesses, as well as in repair and maintenance.\n\n## \u00b7 Asia/Oceania Region\n\nIn Asia and Oceania, sales dropped signifi cantly due to the suspension of business activities in many countries in April because of governmental decrees in response to the spread of COVID-19. However, the Group exploited growing demand from the relaxation of restrictions by strengthening sales from May onwards, and sales for the fourth quarter (January to March) recovered to nearly the same level year on year. As restrictions were eased in residential air-conditioning systems, the Group captured demand, despite the remaining restrictions in place on business activities, as people spent more time at home and from a rebound in the decline in demand when business activities were suspended. In addition, the Group promoted sales through its own dealer channels as shopping malls leasing space to home electronics retailers were closed in many countries due to restrictions on business activities. In commercial air-conditioning systems, a diffi cult situation continued as the spread of infection caused delays in construction starts and construction schedules across the market due to a shortage of workers and mandatory COVID-19 testing at construction sites. For the full fi scal year, net sales decreased year on year as a whole due to the signifi cant impact of the spread of infection in the fi rst quarter (April to June), which is the peak season for air-conditioning use in Asia.\n\n## Segment Profi t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Europe/The Middle and Near East/Africa\n\nIn Europe, the impact of strict lockdowns in response to the spread of COVID-19 in various countries forced the Group to start in a harsh business environment. However, the Group established a stable intra-regional production and supply system even while having to perform sales and promotional activities online and ensure social distancing. In addition, the Group improved business performance by capturing new needs that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as demand from remote work and staying at home, and increased awareness of air quality such as ventilation and disinfection. As a result, overall net sales were higher year over year. Demand for residential air-conditioning systems rapidly increased due to intense heat waves in France, Spain, and other countries, as well as demand from staying at home. The Group capitalized on this demand by taking full advantage of its nearest factories in the Czech Republic and Turkey to provide supply. In addition, the Group strengthened its sales network by developing new dealers and expanded sales of residential heat pump hot water heating systems, aided by new and greater subsidies under the European Green Deal, an economic stimulus measure for European nations aimed at achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030. In particular, sales increased signifi cantly in Germany and Italy thanks to the effects of introducing new models and strengthening marketing capabilities. As a result of these factors, overall net sales of residential air-conditioning systems increased year over year. As for commercial air-conditioning systems, demand from offi ces, hotels, restaurants, and stores, which are major applications, declined due to the repeatedly imposed lockdowns in various countries. Even at food retailers with strong performance, new store construction and renovation projects were cancelled or postponed. Although sales were maximized through the use of proposal-based sales effectively leveraging online tools amid this diffi cult market environment and the restrictions placed on sales activities such as visits to customers and worksites, net sales of commercial air-conditioning systems decreased year over year.\n\nIn the Middle and Near East/Africa, sales of residential air-conditioning systems increased year over year. However, overall net sales decreased year over year because sales of commercial air-conditioning systems were sluggish due to a decrease in the number of projects caused by low crude oil prices. In Turkey, net sales in the local currency increased year\n\nCash Dividends per ShareTotal Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nover year, driven by sales of residential air-conditioning systems and heating systems, but yen-equivalent net sales remained at the same level year over year due to the impact of the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira.\n\nIn the fi lter business, while the global commercial market declined due to the spread of COVID-19, the Group expanded sales of high value-added products that contribute to higher air quality and launched infection control products ahead of competitors. Sales of high-performance fi lters mainly for residential use were strong in the United States, and sales of negative pressure units and air purifi ers grew in Japan thanks to subsidies. In Europe, however, there was a severe impact from lockdowns because sales mainly consist of end users for commercial applications, and there was also customer restraint on investments in commercial dust collection systems for gas turbines, large plants, and similar facilities. As a result, overall net sales in the fi lter business remained at the same level year over year.\n\nIn the marine vessels business, net sales increased year over year due to an increase in unit sales of marine container refrigeration units.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nOverall sales of the Chemicals segment decreased by 8.7% year over year to \u00a5164.2 billion. Operating income decreased by 52.2% to \u00a511.4 billion.\n\nThe general condition regarding overall sales of fl uorochemical products was harsh due to a decline in demand affected by the spread of COVID-19 in a wide range of fi elds, including semiconductors and automobiles, and a decline in demand in the European gas market.\n\nNet sales of fl uoropolymers decreased year over year due to the major drop during the fi rst half of the period, as well as a decline in demand for construction and aircraft in the United States, despite the recovery trend of global demand for semiconductor and automotive-related applications especially in the Chinese market. Net sales of fl uoroelastomers also decreased year over year, despite a recovery in demand in the automotive fi eld centering on the Chinese market.\n\nAmong specialty chemicals, net sales of anti-fouling surface coating agents increased year over year as a result of strong sales in China. In addition, net sales of semiconductor etching agents increased year over year due to sales expansion to meet\n\nWorking Capital and Current Ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsequently, we expanded our lineup of 'air conditioners with ventilation' in order to support 'ventilation,' which has become the norm in homes, sequentially launching the 'Urusara X,' 'Urusara mini,' 'V Series,' 'Ururu Sarara Ceiling Mounted Cassette-Shape Single Flow Type,' and 'Ururu Sarara Floor Mounted Type' from November 2020.\n\nIn facilities used by an unspecifi ed large number of peoplesuch as restaurants, stores, and offi ces-'ventilation' and 'virus suppression' are urgently needed. Accordingly, in May 2020 we released 'titanium apatite fi lters' that absorb bacteria and viruses for use in commercial air conditioners.\n\nMoreover, in September 2020 we launched 'Venti-air,' an exposed installation total heat exchanger unit that can be retrofi tted. The 'Venti-air' system not only eliminates the need to replace ceilings when installing additional equipment in existing buildings, but also can be installed in a variety of ways, including on the ceiling, interior walls, and under the eaves, making it easier to install ventilation equipment. We have also developed three new products that are set to be released sometime from May 2021: the industry's fi rst 'outdoor installation type' that can be installed outside; a 'ceiling-suspension type' suitable for retrofi tting in schools and other facilities where there is no ceiling space; and an 'exposed installation type (150 m 3 /h type)' that can be used in small spaces.\n\nFurthermore, we plan to release from April 2021 the 'UV Streamer Air Purifi er,' which quickly and effectively suppressing viruses in spaces that are diffi cult to ventilate, such as small windowless spaces and conference rooms that are constant use. Developed in cooperation with Asahi Kasei Corporation, this air purifi er is the industry's fi rst to use UVC LEDs, which emit deep UV rays with a wavelength of 265nm that are highly effective in inhibiting viruses and bacteria.\n\nThe 'UV Streamer Air Purifi er' irradiates viruses and bacteria captured by the 'Antibacterial HEPA Filter-a dust collection fi lter with an antibacterial agent attached to conventional electrostatic HEPA fi lters-using our unique powerful decomposing 'streamer' and 265nm deep UV rays, which are highly effective in inhibiting viruses and bacteria. This product suppresses viruses by more than 99% in 30 minutes and bacteria by about 10 times faster than conventional streamer air purifi ers. We will establish a supply system based on domestic production in order to respond to fl uctuations in demand and rapidly supply this product.\n\nWe will continue to develop devices useful for 'ventilation' and 'virus control' by utilizing air purifi cation technology that combines 'streamer technology' and 'UVC LED,' as well as expand our product lineups in order to help further improve air quality.\n\nIn the residential market, there is a growing demand for new air conditioners to be installed in rooms not equipped with air conditioners in light of more time being spent at home working or studying. In order to meet this demand, we launched a new series of products in March 2021: 'risora' a wall-mounted type room air conditioner that features a design that blends in with the room based on its thinness and texture; and the 'Cocotas,' a small space multi-cassette type for small private rooms, corridors, washrooms and other non-residential rooms.\n\nThe 'risora' has a new look, featuring two types of front panels for indoor units. The 'natural wood' panel, with its soft color and wood texture, blends into the room with a relaxing look amid people spending more time at home. The other new panel, 'aluminum silver' is designed to appear different depending on the viewing angle and lighting.\n\n'Cocotas' was previously designed as a multi-type air conditioner in which two or more indoor units were connected to one outdoor unit. In order to meet the increasing demand for air conditioning in small spaces, however, we have developed a pair-type air conditioner that connect one indoor unit to one outdoor unit, making installation easier.\n\nIn the commercial market, we launched the waterless humidifi cation unit 'Ururu Unit' in June 2020 for store users who require humidifi cation such as clinics, cram schools and nursery schools. Applying waterless humidifi cation technology cultivated in room air conditioners enables humidifi cation along with ventilation, resulting in improved room air quality. In February 2021, we released an outdoor installation-compatible version of our 'beltless type' air conditioner for facilities. Indoor facility space can be effectively utilized by installing the indoor unit outdoors. In addition, during installation, maintenance and servicing, work can be done without entering the room, thus reducing the impact on factory operating hours. The 'outdoor air control mode' is used to increase the amount of ventilation in order to meet growing ventilation needs without creating new installation space in rooms.\n\nIn Applied Systems, we released a new dedicated outside air treatment system (DOAS) model in July 2020 in North America, featuring improved operating effi ciency that reduces energy consumption for outdoor air intake. We also released the industry's smallest indoor air handling unit in October 2020. This new unit uses a compact design featuring signifi cant installation freedom, while also realizing the same functionality and performance as larger models. In addition, it uses high-performance air fi lters and an anti-contamination design to provide better indoor air quality.\n\nIn Europe, we launched in September 2020 a water-cooled screw heat pump chiller that uses the low-GWP refrigerant R1234ze. In combination with our air-cooled heat pump chiller already on the market, this product can be used not only for air conditioning but also for supplying hot water.\n\nIn China, we launched a modular magnetic bearing turbo chiller in April 2020, featuring a never-seen-before compact and lightweight design, and it can be transported by forklift or passenger elevator. In addition, units can be connected (cooling capacity expansion) through simple on-site installation to meet the demand for partial upgrades, expansion and split investment of existing properties. In March 2021, we released a modular scroll chiller equipped with a free-cooling function that can signifi cantly improve server cooling effi ciency for small and medium-sized data centers.",

Daikin conducts R&D for new products and new applications based on its rich experience in fl uorine products and fl uorochemical technology. In the fl uoropolymer resin and fl uoroelastomer fi elds, fl uorochemicals exhibit good heat resistance, low drug reactivity, and dielectric properties. Using these properties, Daikin is developing new differentiated products for automotive, semiconductor, wire and cable (IT fi eld), and other applications. Daikin also develops coatings based on the non-adhesive and chemical resistant properties of fl uoride-based substances, and develops textile treatment materials and carpet treatment materials based on the water and oil repellent properties. In addition, Daikin engages in a wide range of fl uoride-related R&D, including the development of telecommunication and information terminal materials based on the functionality of fl uorine containing compounds and the provision of contracted synthesis research for pharmaceutical intermediates.\n\nIn addition to these developments, as part of R&D in peripheral areas aimed at developing new techniques and applications, Daikin is working on the development of fi lm process products and multilayered materials and conducts advanced materials research related to the medical, optical, environmental, electric power battery, and energy areas. Through these initiatives, Daikin is endeavoring to further secure the global No. 1 position and become the sole provider of fl uorochemical solutions. Especially, in the automotive battery fi eld, Daikin is making concerted efforts to grow its ties globally and further expand its markets. In addition, we are pursuing the development of various environmentally friendly products from an SDGs perspective.\n\nBy furthering and accelerating its R&D, the TIC, which has the mission of new product development in Daikin's Chemicals business, is seeking to develop technologies that will lead on next-generation themes.\n\n## Other Operations\n\nR&D expenses for the Other operations totaled \u00a52.0 billion. In oil hydraulics, Daikin is drawing on the special features of its hybrid oil hydraulic systems technology, which combines oil hydraulic technology and inverter technology to realize energy conservation and high functionality that could not be realized with previously existing hydraulic systems. In addition, besides the medium- to low- and small-volume markets, where Daikin is working to expand the adoption in Japan and overseas, the Group is also developing units for high-pressure and high-volume applications.\n\nIn the industrial press and other industrial machinery applications, Daikin's 'Super Unit' has won high acclaim for its low electric power consumption. It also contributes to improvement in the workplace environment and reduction in environmental impact because of its lower noise, reduced heat emission, and smaller tank size.\n\nMoreover, Daikin has launched a large-scale extruder system that equals electric power as a motive force for its responsiveness and energy conservation. By expanding the lineup of units in this series to meet the special needs of countries in Asia and other regions for handling multiple voltages and other features, Daikin will promote the adoption of this system for presses and other machines and move forward with sales\n\nexpansion globally.\n\nAlso, Daikin is proceeding with the development of an energy conservation system for use on special vehicles. One of these units, a hydraulic hybrid system for use on vehicles, has already been adopted. In addition to conventional hydraulic systems, Daikin is proceeding with the development of advanced environmentally responsive products and technology that go beyond existing frameworks and will fi nd applications globally.\n\nIn defense systems, Daikin mainly conducts R&D related to artillery shell and guided missiles components, for Japan's Ministry of Defense, as well as equipment used in home oxygen therapy.\n\n## Dividend Policy and Dividends Applicable to the Fiscal Year\n\nThe Company will continue to focus on expanding its businesses while investing its assets strategically and improving its fi nancial structure by such means as proceeding with the reduction of overall costs and enhancing its fi nancial position. Through these initiatives, we are committed to being a truly global and excellent company while at the same time further improving our corporate value and enhancing profi t returns to our shareholders.\n\nSpecifi cally, by striving to maintain a consolidated ratio of dividend to net assets (Dividend on Equity, DOE) of 3.0% while at the same time aiming for an even higher consolidated dividend payout ratio, we will introduce initiatives to further increase returns to our shareholders with the core goal of stable and continuous dividends.\n\nIn addition, internal reserves will be applied to strategic investments to expand business and increase competitiveness such as reinforcing the structure of management, promoting global businesses, and accelerating eco-conscious product development.\n\nFor the fi scal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has proposed an annual cash dividend of \u00a5160 (\u00a580 for the interim dividend and \u00a580 for the year-end dividend). For the fi scal year ending March 31, 2022, the Company plans an annual cash dividend of \u00a5180 (\u00a590 for the interim dividend and \u00a590 for the year-end dividend).\n\n## Outlook for Fiscal 2021\n\nGoing forward, the global economy is expected to start expanding due to the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines and economic measures taken by various countries. China and the U.S. continue to engage in major fi scal spending and thus are expected to lead the economic expansion, while Europe and Japan are also expected to see a gradual economic recovery, albeit later on. Against this backdrop, we adhere to under the Group's slogan for its Annual Group Policy for 2021, 'Taking 'Overwhelming Changes' as Opportunity, Let's Challenge New Initiatives.' Accordingly, we will take the following initiatives. We will strengthen our Solutions business, which is not limited to the sale of single units; further increase sales of heat-pump heaters and hot-water units; build a low-temperature business that links the cold chain from pro-",

As for technological development, we will also strive to acquire differentiated technologies by collaborating with venture companies and academic institutions.\n\nIn addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) foresees demand for air conditioning more than tripling by 2050, from today's levels, in line with the development of emerging countries. While this represents a huge opportunity for the Daikin Group with its main business in air conditioning, there is the worldwide issue of climate change. Amidst growing demand for decarbonization, there are issues such as curbing energy consumption associated with air conditioning, lowering the use of fossil fuels, and preventing leaks of refrigerants that cause greenhouse effects. Unless we make a concerted effort to control greenhouse gas emissions, these could become a risk for the Group. The Daikin Group aims to respond to these risks by reducing its environmental impact by, for example, developing and spreading the use of refrigerants with lower global warming potential, developing and spreading the use of high-effi ciency air conditioners, and creating solutions for buildings that utilize energy effi ciently throughout the entire facility. In 2018, the Daikin Group formulated its 'Environmental Vision 2050' to aim for zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050, while offering a safe and healthy air environment. Daikin announced its support and agreement with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in May 2019. An important issue is the impact climate change will exert on business continuity, and as such, Daikin analyzes the risks and opportunities it will have on business, and together with refl ecting that to management strategy, the Group contributes to solutions to climate change and other social problems while also aiming for further growth.\n\nFor the fi scal year ending March 31, 2022, Daikin forecasts a 10.3% increase in consolidated net sales, to \u00a52,750.0 billion, with operating income expected to rise 13.1% year on year, to \u00a5270.0 billion, and net income attributable to owners of the parent expanding 13.3%, to \u00a5177.0 billion. The estimated exchange rates for the fi scal year are \u00a5105 to the US dollar and \u00a5125 to the euro.\n\n## Principal Risks Associated with the Daikin Group's Operations\n\nManagement recognizes the following principal risks that may infl uence decisions made by investors given their signifi cant impact on business conditions as stated in the securities report, and among matters pertaining to accounting status, consolidated companies' fi nancial status and business performance, as well as cash fl ows.\n\nThe following have been determined as of the end of the consolidated fi scal year under review.\n\n## (1) Risks related to the market environment\n\n/L54706 Risks related to changes in the market environment The Group develops, procures, manufactures, and sells goods\n\nand services in each of its business domains, chiefl y air conditioning, as it grows its business globally. The Group strives to raise market share by strengthening its sales network, offering competitive products and services, and cutting fi xed costs in order to expand its business and enhance profi tability.\n\nNonetheless, in the event that market conditions deteriorate in countries and regions in which the Group has operations, due to, for example, rising instability in the political and diplomatic situation, trade friction, economic contraction, extreme weather, and outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, there is a possibility that business expansion and increases in profi tability will not progress as planned. As a result, there is a possibility of an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54707 Risks related to fl uctuations in currency exchange rates and funds procurement environment\n\nOverseas sales accounted for a high ratio of the Daikin Group's consolidated net sales in fi scal 2020. The acceleration of global business development going forward is expected to further elevate this overseas sales ratio. Consolidated fi nancial statements are prepared by translating local currency-denominated items for Group operations in each global region, including sales, expenses, and assets. Accordingly, depending on currency exchange rates at the time of the currency translation, there may be an impact on yen translation values even when there has been no change in local currency-denominated fi gures. In addition, because the Group engages in foreign currency-denominated transactions in raw materials and parts procurement and in the sale of goods and services, there is a possibility that fl uctuations in currency exchange rates could impact manufacturing costs and sales performance. To avoid such currency exchange rate-related risks, the Group undertakes short-term risk hedging via forward exchange contracts and similar instruments. Daikin also undertakes medium- to long-term measures to continuously adjust procurement and manufacturing operations and optimize them for changing currency exchange rate trends, and to balance imports and exports in each currency.\n\nThrough this, the Group works to realize a business structure that is not greatly impacted by fl uctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nIn addition, the Daikin Group procures funds necessary for its business activities through loans from fi nancial institutions, or by using commercial paper or bonds. When the economic environment fl uctuates, the lending posture of fi nancial institutions and the situation in funds procurement markets will change, and there is the risk that necessary funds cannot be procured, or that the funding rate will rise. In response to such risks, we set commitment lines, and use interest swaps and other measures to fi x the interest rate, among other efforts. However, there is a possibility that fund procurement costs will rise, and that there will be an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54708 Risk related to fl uctuation in market value of securities\n\nThe Daikin Group takes a strategic approach to holding corporate stock that can be anticipated to enhance Company value. However, stock market trends could cause a decline in the value of these stocks, and potentially impact the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.",

However, the emergence of new technology, products or services that differ from those anticipated by the Group, or abrupt changes to the market such as rapidly escalating competition, including from new market entrants, may lead to the necessity to amend or transform technology or product strategy.\n\nIn that event, delays in bringing about new products or services, or launching new businesses, will cause the Group to lose its advantageous position against competitors or new market entrants. As a result, this may impact the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54707 Risks related to acquisitions and alliances with other companies\n\nThe Daikin Group has in the past utilized corporate acquisitions, in addition to organic growth leveraging existing management resources in order to grow its business globally and to strengthen its product lineup and sales structure. Going forward, to expand its business domains and accelerate the transformation of its business structure, it will aggressively undertake alliances, collaboration, and M&A activities. In the project evaluation stage, the Group not only assessed strategy toward business expansion but also considered the risk in terms of business operation, and following project execution, will strive to ensure that business integration occurs smoothly. Nonetheless, after a project is executed, there is a possibility that integration will not proceed according to plan due to a deteriorating market environment, the inability to fully utilize the management resources of the target company, and the lack of smooth cooperation with the target company, or other reason. As a result, there is a possibility that there will be an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54708 Product and service quality and responsibility\n\nThe Daikin Group operates in over 160 countries worldwide, and endeavors to provide products and services that are in tune with local needs. In addition, it undertakes strict design overviews and quality audits for each respective region, and does its utmost to assure quality and safety. However, by any chance that a problem with regard to safety arises, it gives fi rst consideration to the safety of the customer. To prevent reoccurrence or expansion of the accident, the Group will repair or exchange, and will through newspapers or other means notify and disclose information to sales vendors and other relevant third parties, fulfi lling its responsibilities based on the Product Liability Law.\n\nAs these countermeasures may incur large expense, we have enrolled in product liability insurance, however, in the event that expenses exceed the limit of compensation or if sales decline as a result of a deteriorated brand image, there is a possibility of an adverse impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54709 Risks related to procurement\n\nIn the event management conditions at suppliers deteriorates,\n\nor if natural disasters or accidents occur, the Daikin Group makes efforts to ensure that raw materials, parts, and other items are supplied in a stable and timely manner, and at reasonable prices. This can be achieved by diversifying its suppliers and transitioning to domestic and local procurement, as well as by creating parts commonalities and standardization, among other efforts. However, in the short term, it may be diffi cult to take the measures described above, and in the event of an unforeseen situation, such as the spread of a global pandemic or large-scale disaster, the Group could experience shortages of raw materials and parts, delays in delivery, and other problems. In this case, there is a possibility that this may have an impact on the Group's business.\n\nIn addition, the Daikin Group and its suppliers set prices of raw materials and parts in accordance with a contract. The Group strives to enable procurement at stable prices through long-term contracts and other means, although abrupt changes in the supply and demand environment or fl uctuations in exchange rates may make sharp rises in procurement prices unavoidable.\n\nIn such an event, there is a possibility that there will be an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54710 Legal regulations\n\nThe Daikin Group, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide, is subject to laws and regulations covering competition, the prevention of bribery, human rights, labor and safety, the environment, and other areas in all nations and regions around the world. In each country the introduction of ever more severe laws and regulations and changes in the legal interpretations and operating guidelines of local authorities may lead to limitations of the Group's business activities. The Group conducts an array of training sessions with the aim of thorough compliance, along with the introduction of an annual 'self-check' to confi rm whether or not daily business is being performed in adherence to laws and regulations. Together with raising a consciousness of compliance, the Group conducts audits and confi rms the status of adherence.\n\nNonetheless, in the event that violations of the law occur, there is a possibility that the Group will face administrative action for the payment of monetary penalties. In addition, a decline in brand image has the potential to impact the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## /L54711 Information security\n\nIn the course of carrying out its business, the Daikin Group obtains confi dential information from third parties and personal information from customers, in addition, the Group also handles its own proprietary confi dential information. For that reason, there is a possibility of unauthorized access by hackers or being the subject of a cyber-attack that causes external leaks of personal or confi dential information, which could halt production lines at each location or logistics systems, and exert a serious impact on business.\n\nTo prevent any of these situations from arising, the Group is putting into place countermeasures that include strengthening information security systems, thoroughly controlling confi dential notifi cations, restricting external access, maintaining internal regulations, and conducting education and training. However, in the event such situations were to occur, there may",

        "page_content": "be requirements to pay large-scale damages or fi nes. Moreover, the payment of enormous countermeasure costs has the potential to impact the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## (3)  Risks related to climate change and other environmental issues\n\nClimate change is one of the social problems that the Group must tackle on a global basis. Based on the Group Philosophy to 'Be a Company that Leads in Applying Environmentally Friendly Practices,' the Daikin Group therefore develops and spreads energy-conserving, high-effi ciency air conditioners and refrigerants with lower global warming potential, and generates solutions for the effi cient use of energy throughout entire buildings. In this way it is taking aggressive action to curb greenhouse gas (CO 2 , fl uorocarbons) emissions, and to mitigate climate change. However, in the event that regulations covering use and emissions of greenhouse effect-causing refrigerant gas, and regulations pertaining to energy conservation become more stringent as the shift to a low-carbon society progresses, there is a possibility of increased costs necessary to adhere to such regulations. In addition, in the event that taking a suffi cient response to these regulations is diffi cult and delays occur, product sales may be hindered, and there may be an impact on smooth business operations. One of the physical risks here is damage to the Group's employees, manufacturing facilities, systems, and supply chains in the event of a largescale disaster associated with abnormal weather, which presents the potential for signifi cant impact on business activities.\n\nIn addition, The Daikin Group takes every possible measure to prevent environmental pollution from our business activities, including not only compliance with regulations but also the establishment of even stricter voluntary standards. However, in the event that chemical substances released by the Group effectively give rise to environmental problems, it will be necessary to respond by undertaking purifi cation treatment, paying damages, and other measures, and it is possible that costs will be incurred to address such situations.\n\nThe emergence of such risks entails a possibility of an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation and management performance.\n\n## (4) Others\n\n## /L54706 Impairment of long-lived assets\n\nThe Daikin Group records various tangible and intangible longlived assets, including assets used in operations and goodwill arising from acquisitions. These assets are assessed for any indication of impairment loss. If an indication of impairment is identifi ed, steps are taken to estimate the total amount of future cash fl ows to determine the existence of loss. The future cash fl ows required to make these determinations are based on management plans and are estimated after factoring in future uncertainties. If an impairment loss is recognized in the future due to fl uctuations in business performance or other factors, the fi nancial position and results of operations of the Group may be affected. Meanwhile, the Group monitors its performance on an ongoing basis and strives to take action before it becomes diffi cult to recover investments.\n\n## /L54707 Natural disasters, etc.\n\nThe Daikin Group possesses R&D, manufacturing, sales, and\n\nservice bases around the world. In recent years, Japan has experienced earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, torrential rain, and other natural disasters. In preparation for such natural disasters, the Company takes measures to reinforce each business site against earthquakes, and also acts to put in place countermeasures against tsunamis, signifi cant rainfall, fl ooding, and other disasters. In addition, it also formulates disaster prevention regulations pertaining to natural disasters, and periodically conducts disaster prevention training in efforts to minimize the impact of natural disasters. Nonetheless, there is a possibility that a major natural disaster will signifi cantly impact business activities, and that harm will come to the Group's employees, production facilities, systems, and other assets. At overseas locations as well, in addition to various types of natural disasters, terrorism, riots, wars, and other incidents could conceivably cause harm not only to the Group's business bases, but also to supply chains and customers. This holds a possibility of hindering the Group's business activities and causing delays.\n\nFurthermore, the spread of contagious diseases has become a risk for the Daikin Group's business. In response to the spread of COVID-19, the Group has made securing the health and safety of its employees the top priority in exerting every effort to prevent the spread of infection. The Group has also engaged in addressing important management issues, such as strengthening procurement, manufacturing, inventory, and logistics globally; promoting online sales that address declines in demand and changes in consumer purchasing behavior; expanding sales of ventilation products that seize upon the greater awareness of air quality and ventilation; and developing products that stand out. At the same time, vaccination is also progressing in countries around the world. However, given that it is diffi cult to foresee when the COVID-19 pandemic will come to an end due to factors such as the spread of variants, there is a possibility of an impact on the Group's fi nancial situation or management performance.",
