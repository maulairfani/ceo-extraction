We challenge ourselves to continuously provide innovative solutions based on our strength: Science & Technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunao Manabe Representative Director, President and CEO\n\nneeds.' The mission, which incorporates our Purpose, describes what we should do to fulfill our Purpose. Based on our established strengths in science and technology, we have created many innovative pharmaceuticals with know-how and knowledge across the value chain at the core and provided products addressing diverse needs including generic drugs, vaccines, and OTC drugs. Our common desire to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world is at the root of our business and drives us to realize our purpose. Our strong desire to help patients suffering from illness is reflected to our sincere attitude toward society and customers, which has built trust in the Group.\n\nThe world is now facing a lot of challenges such as climate change and human rights violations. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed society and our lives, and has made us rethink the challenges for the sustainable development of society. I believe that only a company that can meet expectations from society and create shared value with stakeholders including patients by addressing these social issues will be able to grow sustainably and be recognized as valuable. In the process of formulating our 2030 Vision and our current 5-year business plan announced in April 2021, we had a lot of discussions among the members of the Board of Directors in consideration of these thoughts.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFirst, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to people who lost their families to COVID-19. I would also like to express my profound gratitude to healthcare professionals around the world who have been working tirelessly to treat infected people and prevent further spread of infection.\n\nWe have strived to thoroughly prevent the spread of infection in our workplace while continuing research and development activities, ensuring a stable supply of pharmaceutical products and providing the highest quality medical information to fulfill our mission as a healthcare company. We are taking actions to overcome COVID-19 such as mRNA vaccine development and contract manufacturing of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with external organizations by fully leveraging our own research assets, technologies and knowledge.\n\n## Facing Society Faithfully toward the Realization of Our Purpose\n\nOur purpose is to 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world.' Our mission is 'To contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world through the creation of innovative pharmaceuticals, and through the provision of pharmaceuticals addressing diverse medical",

        "page_content": "## Healthcare as a Service, Lifelong Partner to an Individual\n\nIn formulating the current 5-year business plan, we shared the view on what the world could look like in 2030 beyond our 2025 vision which we set in 2016 and discussed the value that the Group will be able to provide sustainably. In light of these, we defined our 2030 Vision as an 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society.' The advancement of our digital transformation will enable the analysis of a variety of data fully utilizing digital technology, and drastically transform healthcare services that is the foundation for the enrichment of quality of life. In the near future, tailored and best healthcare solutions will be provided throughout the life journey of an individual from the very beginning of life through the end. For instance, genetic testing will be able to identify risks or causes for diseases. Utilization and analysis of accumulated big data will enable us to provide the most efficient solutions for the treatment and prevention of diseases.\n\nAdditionally, real-time understanding of health status with a wearable product will enable remote data analysis and service provision. As a wide variety of companies are expected to start providing healthcare services, collaboration with other industries will become essential.\n\nSurrounded by such an environment, considering what value we can provide with certain advantages, I believe that we can contribute to the treatment and prevention of diseases by providing modalities* based on our greatest strengths in science and technology. We will seek to develop various modalities such as nucleic acid drugs, gene therapy, and cell therapy as new treatment solutions to follow antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). With 'patient's perspectives' in mind, we want to be a company that can offer a wide range of solutions to society based on the modalities that work best.\n\n- *  Drugs include small molecules, antibodies, and other types of drug molecules, collectively called modalities.\n- External Environment and How We Will Provide Value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG Management Corresponding to the New Stage\n\nThe ESG management that we drive represents 'management based on a long-term perspective that enhances both financial and non-financial value by reflecting ESG elements in business strategies.' We believe that such long-term focused management translates into sustainable growth of both our company and society.\n\nAs it is described in 'The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers' (Baruch Lev, Feng Gu Published: 2016), value that cannot be read in the financial statements is becoming more important in corporate value (market capitalization) in the market. I believe that such nonfinancial value will be enhanced by ESG management with a long-term perspective. Recent studies show that companies with higher ESG scores better improve long-term returns than those with lower scores, hinting that companies that keep on creating non-financial value grow sustainably.\n\nIt takes many years to create innovative pharmaceuticals. Enhertu \u00ae and other ADCs took many years. Looking ahead 10 years and beyond, we will recognize the importance of management with a long-term perspective and will remain committed to engaging with stakeholders and further advancing ESG management that meets their expectations.\n\n## Business Model Underpinned by Our Strength in Science & Technology (Value Creation Process)\n\nOur 'value creation process' illustrates how we create and provide value to society to realize our Purpose schematically. With our strengths in science and technology as our source of competitive advantage, we invest our important capital such as",

In this way, we create products addressing diverse needs (innovative pharmaceuticals, generics drugs, vaccines, and OTC drugs) to provide value to society. We also contribute to improving access to healthcare, streamlining healthcare financing, and solving other social issues. In these ways we create and provide value to society and reinvest it as capital. By circulating the process, we should achieve both sustainable growth of the company and of society as a whole. Human capital, one of the important capitals for value creation, is positioned as the most important 'asset' in our HR management philosophy. We aim at mutual sustainable growth of the employees and the company by respecting the diversity and promoting the success and development of people in all business fields. These approaches to human resources and our uniqueness of having R&D based in Japan lay a foundation for our strengths in science and technology. In fact, the 3ADCs* we created are the result of collective efforts of a diverse range of highly specialized and experienced talent with capabilities to create new drugs - and this demonstrates the tradition handed down through our history of over 100 years dating back to the days of our predecessor companies - to assess the science, and to create sophisticated drugs. It is these strengths that provide us with the source of sustainable value creation, which gives us confidence in our capabilities to undertake in-house drug discovery.\n\n- *  3ADCs: 1) Enhertu , Trastuzumab deruxtecan ( T-DXd , DS-8201 ), 2) Datopotamab deruxtecan ( Dato-DXd , DS-1062 ) and 3) Patritumab deruxtecan ( HER3-DXd , U3-1402 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Setting the Materiality KPI\n\nIn FY2019, the Group identified material issues at the Board of Directors after much discussion.\n\nThe level of importance of material issues was assessed from two perspectives and was discussed for prioritization. The two perspectives were the existing 'impact on our business' and, additionally, 'expectations from society' that incorporate an ESG approach and will translate into non-financial value. Eight material issues were identified and organized into 'materiality on business' and 'materiality on business foundations.'\n\nNeedless to say, social value creation through 'creating innovative pharmaceuticals' in the 'materiality on business' is the most important materiality in our sustainable growth strategy for establishing a competitive advantage. I consider that the same is true for the 'promoting environmental management' in the 'materiality on business foundations.' The members of the Board of Directors gave many opinions on our corporate social responsibilities for environmental issues, a pressing social issue. We are engaged in business activities that contribute to the healthy life of people around the world. We are strongly aware that our business activities must not cause environmental issues that might threaten the health and lives of people.\n\nAfter about a half year discussion in FY2020, long-term goals as well as KPI targets linked to the current 5-year business plan were set for each materiality. In this process, we obtained opinions and feedback from investors and Outside directors. With this as the first step, we will continue to appropriately understand expectations for us through dialogue with internal and external stakeholders while reviewing material issues every year, confirming progress on the KPI targets, and improving our initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe value we provide to our stakeholders and society through our value creation process\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Recap of the Previous 5-year Business Plan\n\nRegarding the major progress made in each of the six strategic targets, and shareholder returns during the previous 5-year business plan (FY2016-FY2020), first and foremost, we made a remarkable achievement in establishing our oncology business: the launch of Enhertu . With 3rd line treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer a the first indication, we were able to obtain approval and launch the product in the US within only four years and three months from the initiation of the clinical study. Subsequently, it was also launched in Japan and Europe, and is gaining new indications steadily. In addition, the two strategic alliances with AstraZeneca for Enhertu and Dato-DXd have enabled us to develop strategies to maximize the value of these two ADCs. The alliance brought us monetary resources and allowed us to expand the original development plans. In addition, we are enhancing our expertise across the oncology arena.\n\nAs for the continuous generation of innovative drugs, the value of our late-stage pipeline increased substantially, particularly for the 3ADCs, and good progress has been made around drug discovery utilizing a variety of modalities beyond ADC, particularly for nucleic acid drugs, cell therapy and gene therapy.\n\nAs for the financial targets for the previous 5-year business plan, we have optimized manufacturing and R&D structures globally, optimized commercial structures in accordance with our product portfolio in the U.S. and the EU, and divested non-core assets as well and improved our ability to generate profit. However, it is expected that the targets will be achieved in FY2022 or beyond due to the exit from pain business in the U.S. and additional investment associated with substantial progress in the clinical development of the 3ADCs.\n\n## Positioning and Strategic Pillars of the Current 5-year Business Plan\n\nAs the establishment of our oncology business has been progressing well , we are confident that we can realize our 2025 Vision of being a 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology.' Therefore, we decided to position it as a specific target of FY2025. Our current 5-year business plan that covers FY2021 through FY2025 is a business plan designed to achieve our FY2025 target and to shift toward a growth stage to realize our 2030 Vision under ESG management.\n\nThe specific corporate image to be achieved by 2030 is: Global top 10 in terms of oncology revenue; Having additional pillars as a source of growth; New products being a source of profit in each business unit; and Contributing to the sustainable development of society through our business.\n\nThe financial targets for FY2025 are: Consolidated revenue of \u00a51,600.0 billion, of which the revenue from oncology will be more than \u00a5600.0 billion. In other words, the oncology business aims to achieve revenue growth of more than six times than the current level. In light of this, the most important strategic pillar of the current 5-year business plan is 'to maximize 3ADCs,' we will continue to work on maximizing 3ADCs as planned. The key to maximize 3ADCs is development capabilities to produce high-quality clinical data.\n\nTo maximize the potential of each product, high-quality clinical data must also be used to support them. And the strength of global development is critical to obtaining highquality clinical data. We learned the importance of global development capabilities through the global development of edoxaban and mirogabalin . In order to continue to obtain high-quality clinical data, we will further strengthen our global development capabilities.\n\n## Achieve FY2025 Target 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology' and shift to further Growth\n\n- Revenue: \u00a51,600.0 billion (Oncology business revenue: \u00a5600.0 billion or more)\n- Core operating profit ratio before R&D expenses: 40%\n\n## Pro/fit growth for current business and products\n\n## Create shared value with stakeholders\n\n- Maximize Lixiana profit\n- Grow Tarlige , Nilemdo , etc. quickly\n- Transform to profit structure focused on new drugs\n- Profit growth for American Regent and Daiichi Sankyo Healthcare\n- Patients: Contributing to patients through 'Patient Centric Mindset'\n- Shareholders: Balanced investment for growth and shareholder returns\n- Society: Environment load reduction across the value chain, and actions against pandemic risks\n- Employees: Create one DS culture through fostering our core behaviors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Data-driven management through DX, and company-wide transformation through advanced digital technology Agile decision making through new global management structure\n\n## FY2025 Financial Targets\n\n## Maximize 3ADCs\n\n- Maximize Enhertu and Dato-DXd through strategic alliance with AstraZeneca\n- Maximize HER3-DXd without a partner\n- Expand work force and supply capacity flexibly depending on changes around product potential\n- ROE: 16% or more\n- DOE*: 8% or more",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, taking a long-term perspective as a pharmaceutical company, we will 'identify and build pillars for further growth' by taking into account the next 10 years or beyond. We will remain committed to identifying the post-3ADCs growth drivers, and select and advance the promising modalities that will become post-DXd-ADC growth drivers. Generally speaking, it takes more than 10 years of research and development to launch a product. We will work to fulfill our responsibilities by keeping in mind that it also takes 10 years to see the results of strategies developed by the current executives.\n\n## Creating Shared Value with Stakeholders\n\nAs the fourth strategic pillar of the 5-year business plan, four initiatives have been identified for each stakeholder to create shared value with stakeholders.\n\nWith patients, we will further focus on 'Patient Centric Mindset' and co-create value by providing new drugs and information with significant social needs. Going forward, patient centric mindset will become even more important for us as our activities will target oncology and rare diseases more in our pipeline. As such, we are determined to incorporate the voice of patients and their families into the entire value chain by developing new drug formulations considering patient's perspectives, providing easier to understand and more accessible safety information.\n\nWe will also create shared value with stakeholders and investors. We will remain committed to maximizing shareholder value through appropriate information disclosure and constructive discussions. We will aim for ROE of 16% or more in FY2025 and will enhance capital efficiency. As for shareholder returns, in addition to maintaining the current ordinary dividends of \u00a527 per share, we will increase dividends that take account of our profit growth. We will also flexibly acquire own shares and will enhance shareholder returns. We have adopted dividend on equity, 'DOE', based on the policy of stable shareholder returns, as a KPI for shareholder returns going forward. Our target is DOE of 8% or more in FY2025, exceeding cost of shareholders' equity, and maximizing shareholder value through this achievement.\n\nAs for society, we will create shared value by deepening our recognition of social issues we need to address through discussions with various stakeholders. We have established three long-term targets for 2050 to reduce the environmental impact throughout the value chain. They are carbon neutral; 100% recycling; and environmental risk minimization.\n\nAdditionally, we will contribute to society by establishing technology and manufacturing expertise for COVID-19 and future epidemics, and we intend to work on the development of vaccines not only for COVID-19 but for possible future pandemics.\n\nToward creating shared value with employees, we will address changing core behaviors in order to build a unified culture. To achieve the current 5-year business plan, we need to build on the strengths of our global organization and talent\n\nwith the expansion of our oncology business by recruiting diverse talented people from many countries and regions. To create an inclusive culture where people with various values can be their best under One DS Culture, we have defined three 'Core behaviors,' embedded across the entire Group. We will focus on creating synergies by promoting mutual understanding among regions and functions, collaborating efficiently based on transparency and trust, and strengthening human resource development and growth through challenges and proactive actions.\n\n## In Closing\n\nOur Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members give opinions and advice from a variety of perspectives, which has been further enhancing the oversight functions of the Board of Directors.\n\nAdditionally, we will actively engage in a dialogue with stakeholders and incorporate their constructive opinions into management. We also intend to enhance corporate management based on swift and optimal decision-making.\n\nWe have incorporated ESG evaluations by the DJSI, FTSE, and ATM as a performance measure consideration for the newly introduced medium-term performance-based share compensation for executive compensation in Daiichi Sankyo Japan. We will further promote ESG management for sustainable growth and strive to continuously create new drugs for patients that are extremely important for business continuity in 10 years and beyond.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After that, we launched in Japan in May 2020 and in Europe in February 2021. For gastric cancer, SAKIGAKE designation* 2 was granted in Japan in March 2018, and indication for third line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer was approved in September 2020. In the U.S., breakthrough therapy designation was granted in May 2020, and the indication for second line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer was approved in January 2021. We are successfully obtaining approval for additional indications and expanding marketed countries through our strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca.\n\nOur proprietary technologies used for Enhertu , an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)* 3 , are the product of research in which hundreds of compounds were made and tested by screening and optimizing over hundreds of combinations of antibodies, linkers, and payloads to address issues that were identified back then. It was no coincidence that Daiichi Sankyo was able to launch Enhertu in only ten years (which is relatively short period for the development of pharmaceuticals) after a research team with an objective to develop ADC technologies was officially organized in 2010. This is an example that our strategies to develop competitive products succeeded based on our strengths in Science & Technology ('S&T') that have been accumulated for many years. We also established our proprietary ADC technology platform * 4 that is helping us create new ADCs after Enhertu .\n\n- *1: A system in the U.S. that expedites the development and review of medicines that may be more effective than existing therapies in treating serious diseases.\n- *2: Items designated by the SAKIGAKE designation system. The SAKIGAKE Designation System is a core measurement of the 'Strategy of SAKIGAKE' (formulated by Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and released on June 17, 2014). The system aims to lead the world in the practical application in Japan of innovative pharmaceuticals, medical devices, in-vitro diagnostics, regenerative medicines, etc. The system's objective is to designate medical products including pharmaceuticals and regenerative medicines that have the potential of prominent effectiveness against serious and life-threatening diseases in order to make them available to patients in Japan ahead of the rest of the world. The system designates innovative new drugs that meet certain conditions in the early development phases. The drugs designated are prioritized for consultation and reviews for regulatory approval.\n- *3: Antibody-drug conjugate is a medication formed by connecting an antibody and drug (small molecule compound) via an appropriate linker. The antibody connects with the targeted protein that causes cancer to deliver the drug directly to the cancer cells, thereby maximizing the anticancer effect while minimizing the body's systemic exposure to the drug. For Enhertu , our proprietary ADC technology is used where Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary drug-linker covalently combined with an anti-HER2 antibody. https://www.daiichisankyo.co.jp/investors/individual/cancer/\n- *4: Daiichi Sankyo has been promoting several ADC projects including 3ADCs ( Enhertu , Dato-DXd , and HER3-DXd ), using our proprietary ADC technology.\n\n## The Source and Driving Force of S&T\n\nEnhertu is the first product utilizing our proprietary ADC technology, which we expect to be the biggest growth engine for us. Typically, research and development of a new drug takes 9 to 16 years, but Enhertu only took 10 years to commercialize. This achievement was made as a result of our high level of scientific assessment capabilities and technological capabilities to refine drugs, the source of S&T. As a drug discovery-oriented pharmaceutical company, we have cultivated techniques and experiences of drug development over many years. In addition, we set a strategy to thoroughly differentiate our products from competitors by utilizing our high level scientific assessment capabilities. Based on the techniques and experiences under the strategy, we have been taking advantage of the techniques for refining drugs-technologies originated from craftspersonship.\n\nIt takes many years of experience for a researcher to acquire techniques and experiences to find drug development candidates and to refine them. This applies to the researchers who developed our proprietary ADC technologies. They went through a long period of preparation to obtain scientific assessment capabilities through continuous practices in advanced basic\n\n- 'Characteristics of Daiichi Sankyo's ADC' on pages 71 to 72 of Value Report 2020\n\nReference\n\nhttps://www.daiichi-sankyo.es/fileadmin/daiichi-sankyo-contents/DS\\_ES/Value\\_Report\\_2020\\_EN.pdf\n\n- Video: Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and Daiichi Sankyo's ADC technologies\n\nReference\n\nhttps://www.daiichisankyo.co.jp/investors/individual/cancer/",

These activities were started through bottom-up suggestions from research laboratories and were not then included in each company's key research areas. And it is because of the visionary leaders with strong leadership that we succeeded in the biopharmaceuticals discovery area after establishing Daiichi Sankyo. Our proprietary ADC technologies were based on researchers' bottom-up and self-directed leadership. Later, the ADC technologies were invented and developed by combining our own research insights and research assets of our predecessor companies. In 2013, Daiichi Sankyo established the Biologics Function in R&D to develop and accelerate discovery research and manufacturing technologies for new modalities including biosimilar antibodies and nucleic acid medicines, in addition to ADCs. Before the aforementioned initiative, we worked on in-house development of biosimilar antibodies, which we had to give up from business perspectives. However, know-how in antibody production gained through biosimilar development greatly helped the research and development of Enhertu .\n\nWith regard to our proprietary research in ADCs, at first, there were some talks that it was too late to start to achieve successful results. Despite those views, people in our research laboratories thoroughly examined ADC literature, eagerly formulated hypotheses against the difficult challenges associated with ADCs (see the figure below) and validated their hypotheses.\n\nTo solve the difficult challenges, they focused on the selection of payloads and research on drug-linkers, which turned out to be the key to success. As the payload, we selected a novel derivative (DXd) of the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor DX-8951, which was created by our predecessor company. The achievement is owing to the fact that we already had sufficient data on DX-8951. This is because we had progressed the development of DX-8951 to clinical trials, although we discontinued it due to safety concerns perspective. One of the reasons we succeeded is that ADCs can reduce the development of toxicity. The drug-linker was selected from more than 100 prototypes. It is unique and has great features where it can be conjugated with various antibodies and demonstrates high stability in human blood.\n\nOur 'capabilities of refining drugs' accumulated through research and development of small molecules contributed to the development of our ADC technologies. The technique that refines candidates to differentiate and to optimize them through continuous efforts is what we call Japanese artisans' skills-craftspersonship.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate culture-respect each other and exchange opinions in a free and open-minded manner\n\nWe worked on the development of Enhertu with highest priority across the organization as it showed encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 clinical trial. The Biologics Oversight Function established in R&D Unit was upgraded to Biologics Unit. In Japan, a project that aimed large number of workforce re-assignment had started. Outside Japan, we were also making efforts to strengthen and expand the organizations including the development function in the US. We focused on obtaining approval and preparing for the launch of Enhertu across the organization, not only in R&D but also in functions like Pharmaceutical Technology, Supply Chain, Quality Assurance, Marketing, Medical Affairs, and Pharmacovigilance. The culmination of all the hard work done across the organization brought the outstanding achievement to obtain marketing approval only four years after starting clinical trials (it takes four to nine years normally).",

Our driving forces to discover innovative new drugs are researchers' passion for drug development, their perseverance of not giving up nor being afraid of failure, and their eagerness for innovations. Going forward, we will give to the next generation the experiences and lessons learned from success and failure as well as the dedication of Daiichi Sankyo to create the best drugs possible so that we can develop pillars of our research that leads to future drug discovery.\n\nShinagawa R&D Center\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKasai R&D Center\n\n## R&D Organizational Culture and Talent\n\nFor our best-in-class products including Enhertu \u00ae and Lixiana \u00ae (anticoagulant), we conducted research aiming to thoroughly differentiate our drugs from existing products. On the other hand, for our first-in-class products including pravastatin (cholesterol lowering agent) and HER3-DXd , which is under development, research has been conducted focusing on researchers' ideas and imagination to change the Standard of Care (SOC: universally applied best treatment in today's medical practice).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Major Products in the History of Daiichi Sankyo\n\nThe history of the Daiichi Sankyo Group as a pharma innovator goes back to the founding of its predecessor organizations, Sankyo and Daiichi Pharmaceutical. Sankyo started its business with the launch of digestive enzyme Taka-Diastase which also appeared in I Am a Cat , a novel by Soseki Natsume, while Daiichi Pharmaceutical started with the domestic manufacturing of Salvarsan , a therapeutic drug for syphilis, a disease prevalent in Japan at that time. We have continued to produce various drugs needed in Japan, including drugs in the field of infectious diseases. They include Transamin , a hemostatic and anti-inflammatory drug listed in the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines.\n\nWe started global business expansion in the 1980s and promoted the development and launch of new drugs. The launch of antimicrobial agents Tarivid and Cravit in the field of infectious diseases contributed to the suppression of infectious diseases in Japan as well as in the world. While lifestyle diseases draws attention as a social challenge, we have also developed drugs in the area of cerebral and heart diseases, such as the hypercholesterolemia treatment Mevalotin , antihypertensive agent Olmetec / Benicar , and anticoagulant LIXIANA .\n\nOn the other hand, we have worked on research and development of new drugs in oncology, the largest unmet medical needs at present, as the top priority area. We successfully launched ENHERTU , an innovative new anti-cancer agent that utilizes the Group's proprietary ADC technology, a technology that is garnering much attention, in the United States and Japan in 2020 and in Europe in 2021.\n\n## 1899\n\n## 1910\n\nDigestive enzyme Taka-Diastase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1902\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdrenalin , an adrenal cortex hormone agent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1921\n\nDr. Umetaro Suzuki, a future Sankyo scientific adviser, made the world's first discovery of vitamin B1 ( Orizanin ) in rice bran and established a foundation for the theory of vitamins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1915\n\nDr. Shozaemon Keimatsu (founder of Arsemin Shokai, the predecessor organization of Daiichi Pharmaceutical) began domestic manufacturing of Salvarsan , a therapeutic drug for syphilis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * The launch year as the Daiichi Sankyo Group unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 1965\n\nTransamin , a hemostatic and anti-inflammatory agent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBegan manufacturing of Bosmin , a vasoconstriction/ hemostasis and asthma medicine",

Our researchers obtain scientific assessment capabilities and scientific intuition through lessons they learn from success and failure as well as discussions with colleagues, while learning the basics of drug development through daily research.\n\nThe keys to in-house developed products are our talent and the organizations that bring out the best in them. One of our advantages is that we can hire top students as researchers due to recognition of our high-level research and development capabilities. Every year, we employ many, diverse talent with high level of expertise in a wide range of fields, such as pharmacology, synthetic chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. After they join Daiichi Sankyo, we develop them in the organizational culture where people are dedicated to create the best drugs possible. In addition, we develop and enhance talent who support S&T through systems such as programs to gain experience at international academia and research laboratories conducting cutting-edge research; training systems for drug discovery capabilities; and fair evaluation, awarding, and appointments.\n\nIn addition, we are proactively hiring people who have a proven track record as researchers in and outside of Japan. In our corporate culture, researchers respect each other as\n\n## 1985\n\nTarivid , a broadspectrum oral antimicrobial agent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1985 anti-inflammatory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLoxonin , an analgesic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na specialist in science, and exchange opinions in a free and open-minded manner regardless of positions and tenure. This is also one of our major strengths.\n\n## Deep Trust in the R&D Organization\n\nA high level of trust from senior management to the R&D organization is one of the reasons we were able to create an organizational culture where bottom-up suggestions are encouraged in research laboratories. Also, R&D leaders grant a wide range of decision-making authority to each research laboratory. In that way, trust from management strongly motivates researchers to obtain good results from organizationwide and individual research activities.\n\nAdditionally, we have been maintaining R&D expense ratio to sales (see next page) at about 20% on average since FY2006, which is higher than the average of the industry in Japan at 14%.

At R&D, typical researchers include those with scientific points of view to correctly judge researchers' suggestions, who have high capabilities for coming up with ideas, and who are good at verification through experiments.\n\nWe proactively hire leaders from outside. Junichi Koga, former Global Head of R&D, is one of those leaders. His enthusiasm strongly inspired members of R&D, that is: Push the level of biopharmaceuticals in Japan to the global level and realize that at Daiichi Sankyo. The organization smoothly metamorphosed (like an insect that grows with flexibility) so as to focus on research activities with a venture spirit.\n\nAnother example is a leader who had experience as a clinician. The leader significantly raised our global clinical development skills through his world-class experience in clinical development strategies for cancer drugs and his enthusiasm to deliver new drugs to cancer patients as quickly as possible.\n\nAs described above, R&D leaders from outside brought a new wind to the entire organization. Specifically, we have transformed into a global organization that can quickly achieve goals in clinical development, manufacturing, and product launches in oncology including ADCs.\n\nIn our corporate culture, people are flexible enough to candidly accept new ideas, and they respect each other and exchange opinions in a free and open-minded manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cooperation Organically Connected with Science\n\n## Researchers Supporting Our Strengths around Research Base\n\nOne of the sources that support our research base is a rich pool of researchers who have accumulated diverse expertise in drug development. Recently, there is a trend of outsourcing drug discovery. However, we believe that it is important to retain core technologies internally so that we can maintain and strengthen our research and development platform that lies underneath drug development. We have been developing talent to have diverse expertise in various fields including medicinal chemistry* 1 , protein engineering* 2 , drug evaluation, and computational science. This also contributes to demonstrating a high level of scientific assessment capabilities, which is important when discovering drugs using the latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, and global drug discovery networks such as external collaboration.\n\n## Clinical Development Driven by Science & Technology\n\nTranslational research is an approach that aims to improve the productivity of drug discovery by using outcomes from research into clinical development. We expect translational research to help us to efficiently perform research and development as follows: Information obtained through basic research such as the mechanism of diseases is provided to clinical development. Then, insight obtained through clinical trials and clinical practice are fed back to the research function, which helps in formulating new research hypotheses.\n\nWe noticed the importance of this concept early, and in 2009, established Translational Medicine function by integrating groups that are in charge of early phase clinical development and omics research* 1 . Our Translational Medicine function has expanded since it started with about 50 staff members. Currently, 300 members are involved in this function, including members in the Early Clinical Development Department, Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology Department, and Translational Science Department, as well as the Translational Research Department at Daiichi Sankyo RD Novare Co., Ltd., and our organizations outside of Japan.\n\nIn particular, the early-stage development function, which we are focusing on, plays an important role in conducting Proof of Concept (POC)* 2 for clinical trials and connecting the project to late-stage development after obtaining POC. If POC shows expected efficacy or better than expected efficacy, late-stage",

On the other hand, if POC shows no efficacy or the efficacy does not meet the pre-determined criteria, we need to decide whether or not to stop the development as quickly as possible. To achieve this, we assign to early-stage development function the personnel with expertise in development and researchers with long-term experience so that scientific discussions with specialists in research laboratories and external medical institutions can be made more closely.\n\nIn addition, Daiichi Sankyo RD Novare established a clinical research laboratory with cutting-edge technologies, where pathological data and omics data obtained from samples from patients are analyzed. Having own clinical laboratories, we can take advantage of cutting-edge technologies to respond to finegrained clinical needs. This is one of our strengths to conduct high-quality clinical trials.\n\n- *1: Comprehensive analysis of the molecules, DNA (genomics), RNA (transcriptomics), protein (proteomics), etc. that make up the cell for the purpose of clarifying life phenomena.\n- *2: An approach of verifying the efficacy and safety of new drug candidates under research and development in human trials.\n\n## Capabilities to Accomplish Clinical Development\n\nTo conduct late phase clinical trials quickly and with high level quality, operational capabilities that facilitate global cooperation is necessary. To establish such capabilities, we are working on initiatives for seamless global research and development. Starting from the development phase of a project, we proactively discuss development strategies for the project globally, and use those strategies aiming to increase the probability of success through translational research. Further, we conduct clinical trials based on science in order to implement the development strategies formulated.\n\nIn addition, we have capabilities for leading science discussions with regulatory authorities for marketing approval applications, etc., from the patient's perspective with the aim to deliver drugs to patients in each region and country as quickly as possible. One of the examples that demonstrates our strength in quality of clinical trials and flexibility around strategies is when Enhertu was approved in the U.S. for gastric cancer with data from a clinical trial conducted only in Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global R&D in the Future\n\nOur global products, Enhertu and our ADCs that follow Enhertu are being developed using our proprietary ADC technologies. Development of these ADCs contribute to the growth of our global talent, which are our development base. We have been expanding our R&D bases in Europe. Further, we started to expand our global R&D bases including in China. We are\n\nmaking steady progress in establishing an infrastructure where we can conduct agile development globally.\n\nAdditionally, in FY2021, we welcomed Ken Takeshita as our new Global Head of R&D, who has previously demonstrated his skills in the development of many cancer drugs. With him, our research and development entered into a new stage.\n\nR&D leads our sustainable growth as the source of innovation. Under the new Head of R&D, we are further focusing on improving the efficiency of global clinical trials, increasing the speed of decision-making, and developing global talents and next generation leaders, for our growth post 3ADCs. Going forward, we will formulate a unique, global R&D development organization by taking advantage of the strength at each base so that we can capture innovation around the world. At the same time, with our S&T, we aim to continuously discover innovative new drugs that bring hope to patients suffering from diseases including oncology, rare, and CNS diseases.\n\n## Global R&D Structure\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specifically, we collect information on unmet medical needs and analyze and evaluate the collected information. We identify clinical questions existing in the real clinical setting through collecting, analyzing and evaluating the information on unmet medical needs and develop medical strategies to solve them. We perform clinical research activities based on the medical strategies and disseminate new evidence. Repeating this cycle of information collection, analysis and evaluation; and evidence generation and dissemination leads to improved value of the products.\n\n- * Questions related to drug usage from patients or healthcare professionals\n\nMedical strategy",

Medical affairs is also in charge of publication strategy as part of information dissemination activities and effectively disseminates evidence through presentations at scientific conferences and publication of research papers. As the oncology medical practice continues to advance at a fast-moving pace, it is essential to collect information on treatments and competitive products. We are conducting several activities to contribute to maximizing the medical value of products from an early stage of research and development by enhancing these functions to collect, analyze, and evaluate information, as well as by strengthening cooperation with related functions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo help maximize the value of DXd-ADC pipelines and other products as a pharmaceutical company with competitive advantage in oncology, we develop cancer type-based medical strategies in addition to product-based medical strategies, and carry out relevant activities. In addition, we enhance the functions of medical science liaison (MSL)* 1 , real world evidence (RWE)* 2 , and companion diagnostics/biomarkers. Cooperating with related functions, we complement 'Fast to Market strategies' (meaning strategies to obtain approval and launch a product in the shortest period of time) from a scientific and medical perspective. Through patient advocacy activities (such as support for patient groups) mainly outside Japan and the publication of patient-friendly manuscripts, we will also strengthen patient-centric information collection and evidence dissemination.\n\n- *1  Conduct medical and scientific communication with external medical experts based on the latest scientific knowledge in the related disease area\n- *2 Evidence from analysis of actual clinical data\n\n## Provision of Safety Information through ILD Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe principle of PV in R&D based pharmaceutical companies starts with first in human (FIH) study.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Clinical Safety & Pharmacovigilance Unit, which is responsible for pharmacovigilance (PV) of the entire group, evaluates reported adverse events from clinical trials to postmarketing period, and develops and implements safety measures based on the evaluation results.\n\nFor Enhertu , we identified Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) as an 'important identified risk', and we continue to implement safety measures by developing guidelines for the management of ILD and the guide for physicians and patients participating in clinical trials for ILD education. After launching in several countries where Enhertu has already been approved including the United States and Japan, we have collected and evaluated patient information of ILD development, and have continued to provide related information to promote proper use to healthcare professionals, so that the risk of progression to severe disease would be reduced by early identification and intervention for ILD,\n\n## Development of a Clinical Study Data/Adverse Drug Reaction Search Tool (Safety Lake)\n\nWith the launch of Enhertu , we are required to provide safety information with higher expertise/individuality. The information includes not only post-marketing data but also clinical study data. Traditionally, information provision took time, because safety management division staff responded to inquiries from healthcare professionals sent via MRs by searching through an enormous amount of clinical study information.\n\nIn order to provide healthcare professionals with best safety information for patients faster, we developed a clinical study data/adverse drug reaction search tool (Safety Lake) utilizing an integrated data analysis platform and BI* tool and introduced it to Enhertu . Safety Lake enables more exhaustive search than before and faster information provision.\n\n*Business intelligence tool: a tool to support decision making and business operation through data analysis and its visualization",

Compliance issues may damage corporate  reputation.

Across the Daiichi Sankyo Group companies, we believe compliance is the foundation  of our business activities. Therefore, we promote a compliance management system  which encourages each employee to behave with the high ethical standards, in  addition to complying with applicable laws and regulations.

Moreover, global policies are required to be adhered to and disclosed appropriately outside of a company to show that its global business activities are being conducted with integrity. In April 2015, we established a global policy on the individual behavior of all executives and employees. Replacing the Daiichi Sankyo Group Individual Conduct Principles, we established the Daiichi Sankyo Group Employee Code of Conduct ('ECC') to provide broader, uniform standards of individual behavior expected of executives and employees of all Daiichi Sankyo Group companies in April 2020.\n\nWe are also conducting training programs regularly to increase awareness of the ECC. In FY2020, we conducted its training using unified materials for the Daiichi Sankyo Group, not only to raise awareness of the ECC, but also to foster\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting Sustainable Procurement Activities\n\nTo realize a sustainable society, the Daiichi Sankyo Group believes that it is essential to work together with its business partners to promote sustainable procurement based on a mutual understanding. As part of these efforts, the Group conducts a CSR Self-Assessment Survey every three years based on the Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCC)* in cooperation with its major business partners, in order to deepen their understanding of BPCC and strengthen communication with them. We are conducting the second survey (FY2020 to FY2022), having sent the questionnaires to 403 major business partners in Japan and overseas in FY2020, and 340 companies (84%) have already responded as of March 31, 2021.\n\na sense of harmonization across the Group companies. We will continue to provide training regularly to raise individual compliance awareness among executives and employees, which will help to reduce compliance risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn light of the survey results, we will promote and strengthen sustainable procurement based on mutual understanding through continuing communication with our business partners.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is working on building a system to objectively evaluate and continually monitor potential risks of our business partners by using an external data source, which further enhances our compliance system with respect to our business partners.\n\n* This Code of Conduct stipulates compliance rules in such fields as ethics, human rights, safety and health, and environmental management with which the Group urges its business partners in Japan and overseas to comply.\n\n## CSR Self-Assessment Surveys\n\nFirst CSR Self-Assessment Survey Results (period, FY2017 to FY2019)\n\nSecond CSR Self-Assessment Survey (period, FY2020 to FY2022) in progress\n\n|                                                                  |   Number of companies  surveyed | Number of respondents  (Response rate)   |   Number of companies  we communicated with |   Number of companies  surveyed | Number of respondents  (Response rate)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Total                                                            |                             381 | 355 (93%)                                |                                          26 |                             403 | 340 (84%)                                |\n| Sub-total of (1) to (3)                                          |                             248 | 230 (93%)                                |                                          18 |                             263 | 231 (88%)                                |\n| (1) Raw materials  *1                                            |                             119 | 113 (95%)                                |                                           6 |                             138 | 116 (84%)                                |\n| (2)  Licensed products and consigned  manufacturing products  *2 |                              99 | 92 (93%)                                 |                                           7 |                              89 | 85 (96%)                                 |\n| (3) Manufacturer/Non-tier 1 Supplier * 3                         |                              30 | 25 (83%)                                 |                                           5 |                              36 | 30 (83%)                                 |\n| Indirect materials * 4                                           |                             133 | 125 (94%)                                |                                           8 |                             140 | 109 (78%)                                |\n\n- *1 Raw materials for pharmaceutical products manufactured by the Daiichi Sankyo Group\n- *2 Contract manufacturing outsourcing\n- *3 Manufacturers of raw materials for our products that have no direct contract with the Daiichi Sankyo Group\n- *4 Purchased goods (facilities, equipment, services) other than those described in (1) to (3)\n\n## External Evaluations\n\nThe Group has been included in the DJSI World Index, ESG indices managed by S&P Global to evaluate the sustainability of a company, for four consecutive years.

During this period, we will prioritize R&D and capital investments for 3ADCs, our growth drivers, as well as stable dividends and dividend increase taking our profit growth into account.\n\nAdding the planned operating cash flow before R&D expense for the next five years to our current cash in hands, available source for cash allocation during the current 5-year business plan is estimated to be approximately \u00a52.8 trillion. Our plan is to allocate approximately \u00a51.5 trillion to R&D prioritizing 3ADCs; and to allocate approximately \u00a5500 billion to capital investment focusing on enhancing DXd-ADC production and supplying capabilities. As for the production and supply of ADCs, we plan to invest in outside contract manufacturing organizations in addition to global in-house manufacturing facilities. Our investment will depend upon the progress of 3ADCs and following DXd-ADCs to build a global supply chain with resilience that can maintain stable supply of products not only in case of rapid growth in demand but also in times of natural disasters, pandemics, and other contingencies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, we will achieve further profit growth through additional growth of American Regent and Daiichi Sankyo Healthcare businesses both of which are already making significant contributions to our consolidated profit.\n\nIn addition to increase operating cash flow through profit growth in our current business, we will also enhance our total asset turnover ratio by streamlining non-core assets to further generate cash for growth investments and shareholder returns.

Furthermore, we intend to increase the value of our product portfolio and pipeline through continued investment aimed at sustainable growth, translating into higher corporate valuation in the stock market.\n\nindicator calculated by multiplying the ROE by dividend payout ratio has been adopted as a KPI for shareholder returns.\n\nWith increased profitability through the growth of our 3ADCs, and with enhanced capital efficiency through flexible acquisition of own shares, we will aim for ROE of 16% or more in FY2025. I would like to note that the current equity ratio of around 60% is assumed to be maintained to ensure financial soundness.\n\nAs for shareholder returns, in addition to maintaining the current ordinary dividends of \u00a527 per share and dividend increase taking account of our profit growth, we will also flexibly acquire own shares for further enhancement.\n\n## Trend in Total Shareholders Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  Calculated based on share price and dividend per share after reflecting the 3-for-1 split of common stock effective October 1, 2020\n\n## Strengthening Our Ability to Finance Drug Discovery for Sustainable Growth\n\nIn the current 5-year business plan, our target is to increase the core operating profit ratio before R&D expense to 40% in FY2025, the final year of the 5-year business plan. Core operating profit before R&D expense can be reworded as our ability to finance drug discovery that secures enough profit to cover both R&D expense for in-house drug discovery and cash to acquire external seeds and technologies for drug discovery.\n\nWe will improve the cost of sales ratio mainly through continuous cost reduction and sales expansion of highly profitable products. At the same time, we intend to contain costs by minimizing spending on low ROI expenses and improving the productivity of the entire value chain through DX. In this way, while strengthening our ability to finance drug discovery, we will remain committed to increasing the value of our product portfolio and pipeline in order to maximize shareholder value.\n\n## In Closing\n\nAs described in the materiality section, we have identified issues to be addressed for sustainable growth considering both the importance of the impact on our mid-to-long-term corporate value and the expectations of society, and have advanced management based on a long-term perspective, reflecting ESG elements in business strategies.\n\nWe are absolutely determined to achieve our financial targets for the current 5-year business plan. Furthermore, we will develop our strong financial base that allows us to create shared value with the patients, their families, healthcare professionals, our shareholders and investors, employees and other stakeholders, and will contribute to the sustainable growth of Daiichi Sankyo and the development of society. I very much appreciate your continued support.",

The Group is promoting risk management by taking steps to address risks inherent in corporate activities by retaining, reducing, avoiding, or transferring these risks. In addition, we seek to minimize the impacts of risks on people, society, and the Group should they occur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Management\n\nIn the Group, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) oversees Groupwide risk management as the Risk Management Officer (RMO) and promotes risk management in conjunction with an annual cycle of formulating and implementing business plans.\n\nIn addition, the heads of each business unit autonomously manage risks to aid in the accomplishment of their units' goals and targets. To this end, they identify risks, formulate and implement countermeasures, and provide employees with information on underlying risks in the organization, education, and insight concerning risk management.\n\nThe Risk Management Office assesses the risks identified by each unit from the aspects of their impact and probability.\n\nRisks with the potential to significantly affect the management of the Company are identified as material risks at the Management Executive Meeting and the DSC Board of Directors Meeting (see the conceptual diagram below on the Group's risk level classification). In addition, responsible persons are appointed for each material risk and they implement risk countermeasures in cooperation with relevant organizations. The progress of the risk countermeasures are checked through risk monitoring twice a year and the countermeasures are corrected or improved upon as necessary. Should precursors of the potential occurrence of a material risk be detected, related information will quickly be assembled for the RMO and reported to the CEO.\n\n## Overview of Risk & Crisis Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conceptual Diagram of the Group's Risk Level Classi/fication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of the Risk Management Structure\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the purpose of minimizing loss due to the occurrence of a crisis, the policy stipulates basic items related to crisis management.\n\nThe Group also has a structure to respond flexibly to crisis depending on the event (disaster, accident, incident including terrorism, scandal, breach of laws, information managementrelated problem, product-related problem) or the degree of impact of the crisis (see the figure below 'Initial Response to Crisis'). We have clearly defined the reporting criteria and lines and established the Crisis Management Officer (CMO), either the CEO or an officer appointed by the CEO, and the person\n\nresponsible for the initial crisis management (the Vice President of the Corporate Affairs and Procurement). For a crisis with a global impact requiring a group-wide response, we strive to prevent circumstances from becoming worse and to resolve it at an earlier stage by sharing the relevant information with the RMO (CFO) and through prompt and appropriate initial response. After the crisis has been resolved, we conduct an ex-post analysis to prevent a recurrence of the crisis and improve, as necessary, our response protocol.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, we established a COVID-19 Emergency Headquarters headed by the CMO (CEO) at an early stage, and work together with other departments to ensure the safety of employees as well as the stable supply of pharmaceuticals.\n\n## Initial Response to Crisis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basic Policy\n\nIn the event of a crisis, crisis management shall be conducted promptly and with certainty to minimize the impact on people, society, and the company with the principle of securing the lives of employees of the Daiichi Sankyo Group companies and related parties and the safety of the local community, and fulfilling the responsibilities of a company that is engaged in a business that affects human lives, and making efforts to ensure business continuity and early recovery from the crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Continuity Plan (BCP)\n\n* Business Continuity Plan\n\nWe have formulated a business continuity plan (BCP) for the Daiichi Sankyo Group companies in preparation for four major threats to business continuity: natural disasters, facility accidents, pandemic of new influenza and other infectious diseases, and system shutdown. Based on this plan, systems are in place to quickly restore operations and to ensure a stable supply of pharmaceuticals with assured quality to support the continued provision of medical services, in the event of an emergency.\n\n## BCP assuming natural disasters and facility accidents\n\nBased on its experiences following the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Group revised our BCP in 2012. Since then, we have continued to improve upon the BCP through such means as reviewing the list of priority supply drugs for which supply should be prioritized and the disaster response plans at our production sites based on revisions to national disaster response plans and social needs. In this manner, we strive to ensure effective response and cope with the increasingly complex and globalized production and logistics landscape if the thread occurs.\n\nWe have developed and regularly revise the list of priority supply drugs that are used by a large number of patients, that are needed in emergencies, or that cannot be substituted by other drugs. In this way, we have established a system to supply necessary drugs continuously and appropriately if the thread occurs.\n\nBCP measures are taken for necessary management resources such as facilities, logistics/inventory/personnel, and information from four viewpoints: implementing preventive measures, ensuring diversity, ensuring support measures, and ensuring alternative measures.\n\n## Action Plan for the Pandemic of New In/fluenza\n\nTo prepare for a global outbreak and pandemic of new influenza, the Group formulated the action plan for the Pandemic of New Influenza in 2009 for the purpose of ensuring the safety of employees and their families and continuing the supply of pharmaceuticals. In response to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, we have taken flexible measures in accordance with the action plan, and, based on the knowledge gained through this experience, we will review the action plan to make it more practical.",

The Group considers that taking actions against risks associated with information management is one of the important matters in corporate activities, partly because opportunities for collaborations with other companies have been increasing. As such, we are strengthening measures globally with regard to information management/security structures while developing regulations on information management and a security system, among others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening Information Management Governance Structure\n\nIn order to provide stable products and information to patients and other customers, the Group companies are endeavoring to establish a security management system based on ISO/ IEC27001.\n\nWe have also appointed the CIO responsible for overseeing global specialized function in the information field and the CISO responsible for the confidential information management and the promotion of information security measures in order to prepare policy rules on new digital technologies, laws and regulations, and others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Unifying Information Management-Related Regulations\n\nFor effective and efficient implementation of information management initiatives across the Group, policies and procedures have been standardized among the group companies in Japan.

Accordingly, we have worked on creating a mechanism for safe and secure use of information by setting the basic policy on information management as well as developing rules and guidelines. In addition, by regularly educating employees and taking steps on the use of cloudbased services, we are improving information literacy and information-related ethics of each employee so that they can have a correct understanding of information security. Furthermore, with cooperation with CIO, we are stepping up efforts to ensure information security, indispensable for promoting DX* as a part of the business strategies of the entire Company and each organization.\n\nCompany, but also outside the Company.\n\nIn order to strengthen measures against cyber attacks on IT systems, among others, we are promoting the reinforcement of information security infrastructures such as, for example, safeguard function and detection/handling function and the improvement of infrastructure operations to raise the level of measures globally.\n\nWe believe that the vigilence of all employees is essential to respond to security issues and protect information resources. With this in mind, as part of the information security education activities for employees, which are conducted according to the situation at each Group company, we continue to conduct e-learning about information security as well as awarenessraising and reminding staff about targeted e-mail attacks and other cyber threats.\n\n- *  Computer Security Incident Response Team.

Colleagues across the Group companies possess important information which is confidetnail to DS and also our business partners. This is, in part, true because opportunities for collaborations with other companies have been increasing. Therefore, ever-tighter management of information is required. Given these circumstances, the Group companies have adopted stricter cyber security measures with the following five functions in mind and strives to secure business continuity by actively grasping and responding to risk factors like information leak.\n\nIdentify-\n\nGathering information on and recognizing threat to information security\n\nProtect-\n\nReducing the likelihood of threat occurrence\n\nDetect-\n\nDetecting incidents as early as possible\n\nRespond-\n\nPreparing an incident response plan, and reducing the impact\n\nRecover-\n\nDeveloping system recovery procedures\n\nThe CSIRT also promotes initiatives aimed at dealing with the threat of cyber attacks in cooperation with a variety of organizations including those in the same and other industries and public institutions.

For the past seven years, I, as an outside director, have been dedicated to understanding the Company's business, corporate culture, and values. At the same time, I have also worked to make decisions on important management issues and supervise their execution. When assuming the position of the Chairman, I felt immense responsibility and expectations, but I was able to make a good start thanks to the other members of the Board, who have a wide variety of experiences and expertise.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo, possessing the advantages of a traditional Japanese company, has great competence in drug discovery backed by its Research and Development (R&D) capabilities. In FY2020, the Company's R&D expenses reached \u00a5227.4 billion, with a high ratio to revenue of 24%. I started my career at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), where I eventually served as senior executive vice president and chief technology officer (CTO). Speaking from that experience, I note that the Daiichi Sankyo Group's investment in R&D\n\nrequires a longer period of time and a larger ratio (to revenue) than an IT company. This means that R&D has a very important position in the Group's management strategy. The Company is currently at the stage of enhancing its development capabilities to expand its R&D results globally, thereby increasing its global presence. Since there is a wealth of highly specialized talent across Daiichi Sankyo, I believe that the Company can further enhance the execution capabilities of the entire organization while leveraging its strengths.\n\nToday, there are social issues that pharmaceutical companies must address, such as overcoming diseases and improving access to healthcare. To resolve those issues, the Daiichi Sankyo Group is committed to providing value to society by creating medicines that meet social needs and by delivering them to as many patients as possible around the world. To fulfill our purpose 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' Daiichi Sankyo needs to continue to grow into a company whose existence is recognized as meaningful to the global society.",

        "page_content": "## Effectiveness of the Board of Directors to Value and Corporate Value that the Daiichi\n\n## Lively Discussions by Balanced and Diverse Members of the Board\n\nThe core principles of strong corporate governance are to secure fairness, independence, and transparency, to separate execution and supervision, and to ensure that the Board of Directors fulfills its supervisory function. I recognize that the major role of the Chairman of the Board is to create an environment conducive to lively discussion and to integrate the knowledge of Members of the Board effectively. Outside directors can effectively provide input and also judge whether the company's thinking is in line with external and shareholders' perspectives.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors is well balanced considering attributes such as the ratio of inside and outside members and the percentage of female members in Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board Members. The adequate balance of the Board of Directors is also indicated by the skill matrix, for its diversity in experience and areas of expertise. Each member of the Board strives to demonstrate their expertise and knowledge, and this is a key point for stimulating discussions.\n\nHaving an outside director serve as Chairman of the Board has helped to facilitate more in-depth discussions between internal and outside directors.\n\nIn FY2020, we spent significant time reviewing our longterm vision and discussing medium- to long-term strategies. Outside directors made a significant contribution based on their experience and knowledge, particularly in discussing risk management, female empowerment, sustainability such as environmental management and access to healthcare, and the promotion of digital transformation (DX).\n\n## Evaluating the Board of Directors to Further Enhance its Effectiveness\n\nIn FY2020, we implemented various initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, reinforcing its supervisory and decision-making functions.\n\nFor the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe development of the current 5-year business plan was a matter of top priority. Therefore, to discuss to the fullest extent, we set up opportunities to exchange views on the plan, both in and outside the Board of Directors' meetings. In addition, the Board of Directors needs to take a particularly close look at large-scale R&D investments. For this reason, we have implemented initiatives such as Lessons Learned verification of R&D management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We reviewed the roles of the Board and the executive side and the division of decision-making between them, aiming to improve the supervisory function of the Board and enable flexible and prompt execution. As Chairman, I have close communication with the executive members including the CEO and the CFO. Also, information sharing between both sides has been improving as outside directors have become sufficiently informed of management executive meetings and other events.\n\nThe self-evaluation by all directors is conducted every fiscal year, and it has generated many candid opinions. Among them, the Company has identified the issues and points that can help improve the functions and effectiveness of the Board of Directors. The Company plans to implement a third-party evaluation by an external organization in FY2021.\n\n## 'Aggressive Governance' to Support Efforts to Fulfill Social Significance from a Long-Term Perspective\n\nIn today's rapidly changing external environment, we are aware of the need to adopt the perspective of 'aggressive governance.' I believe that in order to achieve sustainable growth, we must not hesitate to make changes while giving due consideration to risks. Recently, the Board of Directors, including outside members, has given its full support to the Daiichi Sankyo Group's direction toward expanding the vaccine business, considering its strengths in specific technologies and R&D, as well as the needs of society. With its own production bases for seasonal influenza vaccines, among others, Daiichi Sankyo has supplied vaccines in normal times. Moreover, in March this year, Daiichi Sankyo embarked on efforts against the spread of COVID-19 by starting phase 1/2 clinical trials of a mRNA vaccine (DS-5670) based on new technology in Japan.\n\nBoard of Directors' discussion involves identifying any risks and making rational judgments on the appropriateness of an investment. I also want to consider that the person in charge of a project has a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm toward achieving the goal. The passion of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees for innovation and the people with diligence and sincerity are strengths of the Daiichi Sankyo Group. I would like to further invigorate the corporate culture that fosters such qualities.\n\n## Incorporating ESG Evaluation in Executive Compensation to Accelerate Initiatives\n\nDaiichi Sankyo has incorporated ESG evaluations by the DJSI *1 , FTSE *2 , and ATM *3 into the medium-term performancebased share compensation that was newly introduced to the executive compensation system this year.\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo Group attaches great importance to ESG management. The Board of Directors has adopted a sustainability perspective to address issues such as social and environmental problems and identified eight material issues. We put considerable time into discussing these issues FY2020 as well and set KPI target values, largely reflecting the knowledge of outside directors. The key to achieving the set KPI target values is to determine how to specifically incorporate the target values into business activities and put them into practice, which requires the commitment of the entire Group. I also find it essential to engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders.\n\nRegarding ESG, although the Company has received high external evaluations from several third-party organizations, I think that Daiichi Sankyo should aim for even higher evaluations and improve its delivery of information and its appeal, especially to external parties.\n\nAs for DX, the Digital Transformation Management Division, which was established last year, should play a central role in further utilization of ICT (Information and Communications Technology ) for Daiichi Sankyo's management and business. The Company needs to step up efforts to develop DX unique to Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n- *1:  Dow Jones Sustainability Indices evaluating the sustainability performance by S&P Dow Jones Indices, USA. It comprises global sustainability leaders on the analysis of long-term economic, environmental and social performance of companies.\n- *2:  FTSE Russell, a wholly owned subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange, develops ESG indices which comprises companies demonstrating strong ESG performance.\n- *3:  The Access to Medicine Foundation, a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands, assessed 20 leading global pharmaceutical companies on improving access to medicines in developing countries.\n\n## Cooperating with Society to Realize the Daiichi Sankyo Group's Purpose and Vision\n\nIn April 2021, we announced our 2030 Vision, 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society,' with the aim of realizing our Purpose 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world.' The Board of Directors recognizes the need to discuss future visions as Daiichi Sankyo moves forward to build growth pillars not only in the oncology business but also in other areas. The Daiichi Sankyo Group has the ability and a wealth of achievements to actualize the Purpose. However, in order to realize the 2030 Vision, we need to raise public awareness of the value that the Group creates. It is also important to increase the number of stakeholders, including partners who agree with the Purpose and Vision and are willing to cooperate. I will do my utmost as Chairman of the Board and outside director to further enhance Daiichi Sankyo's corporate value.",

In order to set the KPIs, the Members of the Board held monthly discussions from December 2020 to March 2021. Members of the Board made the following comments on the long-term goals of materiality and challenges in attaining the goals: 'How is it possible to express Daiichi Sankyo's unique outlook on the world toward the realization of the purpose?' 'Consideration should be given to even further proactive initiatives for the environment, a globally important social issue, and the content of the descriptions,' and 'More emphasis should be placed on the fact that the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality and drug development is to extend the life span of people.' In response to the opinion that 'it is necessary to capture the changes in the social environment caused by COVID-19,' we reconfirmed the positioning of materiality based on the environmental changes caused by COVID-19. We also have the following comments: 'It is desirable to consider narrowing down the KPIs so that they are more comprehensive rather than detailed,' and 'The KPIs should specifically indicate the degrees of achievement.' With those opinions taken into consideration, the KPI target values, through a thorough examination, were decided at the Board of Directors' meeting in March 2021.",

Key points of the new compensation system starting from FY2021 are as follows.\n\n## Level of compensation\n\nThe level of compensation to Directors is set with reference to the level of compensation at other companies in the higher end of the industry, based on surveys of external professoinal institutions. Specifically, the Company will primarily compare companies within the top 100 companies by market capitalization among the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and also refer to the levels of major domestic pharmaceutical companies.\n\n## Ratio of the composition of compensation\n\nPrior to FY2020 the compensation of the Representative Director, President and CEO was designed to be 60% for basic compensation, 20% for annual performance-based bonus, and 20% for restricted share-based compensation when the performance goal is achieved 100%. We have introduced medium-term performance-based share compensation to increase the variable compensation ratio.\n\nWith the new system, the compensation of Representative Director, President and CEO is designed to be 40% for basic compensation, 30% for annual performance-based bonus, 15% for restricted share-based compensation, and 15% for the medium-term performance-based share compensation when the performance goal is achieved 100%. (See Table 1)\n\nThe ratio of the components of compensation to other Directors (excluding Outside Directors) is determined in\n\nMessage from Chairperson of the Compensation Committee\n\n## Kazuaki Kama\n\nOutside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe revision of the compensation system that we had discussed was approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders held in June 2021. Key points of the revision are: (1) Set the compensation level suitable for aiming at the high level in the industrial sector, and (2) Establish a compensation system that can encourage Inside Directors to work on\n\nconsideration of the responsibilities and the level of compensation according to that of Representative Director, President and CEO. Compensation to Outside Directors consists only of basic compensation and not bonuses/shares.\n\n## Medium-term performance-based share compensation (long-term incentive compensation)\n\nMedium-term performance-based share compensation, which has been newly introduced as a long-term incentive compensation, is a trust-type share compensation system that has the property of a performance share (performance-based share compensation) for the Directors (excluding Outside Directors) and the Corporate Officers as compensation based on the achievement of the performance of the 5-year business plan in order to promote management with an emphasis on increasing shareholder value over the medium to long term.\n\nThe indicators for the achievement of mid-to-long-term (see Table 2) includes not only financial indicators but also nonfinancial indicators such as research and development progress and ESG indicators. The performance-based coefficient is determined within the range between 0% and 200% according to the degree of achievement of those targets.\n\n## Clawback provision\n\nDaiichi Sankyo has established a clawback provision that can request a refund of part or all of the compensation received for annual performance-based bonuses and medium-term performance-based share compensation by the resolution of Board of Directors after consultation with the Compensation Committee in the event of a material accounting error, or fraud, or record of a significant impairment loss occurs.\n\nThis clause will be applied from FY2021 annual performance-based bonus and the medium-term performancebased share compensation and will be applied for all periods thereafter.\n\ninitiatives from short-term and mid-to-long-term perspectives, and appropriately reward them for their efforts. To do this, we have introduced a trust-type, medium-term performance-based share compensation system. In addition, we have established a clawback provision that can request for the refund of part or all of the compensation received for annual performance-based bonuses and the medium-term performance-based share compensation by the resolution of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn FY2021, the Compensation Committee intends to exchange views in a free and open-minded manner as before by focusing on follow-ups to ensure the smooth operation of the new compensation system. In addition, as increased disclosure about executive compensation is required, we continue to ensure sufficient accountability to our stakeholders.",

For candidates for Directors, the Board of Directors appoints the candidates after they have been sufficiently verified by the Nomination Committee, which is composed of 4 Outside Directors. For candidates for Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Board of Directors appoints the candidates after they have been sufficiently verified by the Nomination Committee and then agreed to by the Audit & Supervisory Board. An appointment of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members is referred to the General Meeting of Shareholders. As for candidates for the CEO, they are appointed in accordance with the successor plan, qualification requirement definitions, etc. that have been discussed by the Nomination Committee, and an appointment (including reappointment) of the CEO is determined by the resolution of\n\nMessage from Chairperson of the Nomination Committee\n\nTsuguya Fukui Outside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Nomination Committee discusses matters including appointment of most executives and make recommendations to the Board of Directors.

Dismissal of CEO shall be called into account in light of the Companies Act, defined CEO eligibility requirements or requirements for execution of duties, and determined in the same manner as appointment, by resolution of Board of Directors over a recommendation from the Nomination Committee that the Committee submits after sufficient deliberation.\n\nOutside Directors, and one Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member participates as the observer. In this way, we can ensure fairness, neutrality, and transparency when discussing the appointment of important executives who will take positions that determine the fate of Daiichi Sankyo, including CEO, CFO, Directors, and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. I intend to run the committee with that in mind.\n\nI expect the Daiichi Sankyo's CEO not only to be good at managing of the Company for the coming years but also to continue to have a great dream for the future-to develop new ways to cure diseases of people around the world and improve the health of them even if it would take decades.\n\nSupervisory Board Members are held after the Board of Directors' meetings.\n\nApproximately 120 minutes were devoted to Audit & Supervisory Board meeting, and 15 proposals were on the agenda this fiscal year.\n\n## Key matters for sharing and consideration in Audit & Supervisory Board meetings\n\n- Audit policy, audit plans, and segregation of duties\n- Audit Reports by Audit & Supervisory Board\n- Evaluation of Accounting Auditors\n- Evaluation of the effectiveness of Audit & Supervisory Board\n- Internal audit plans and the results\n- Status of audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members of domestic Group companies\n- Status of execution of duties by Full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Member on a monthly basis",

With that experience, I am actively participating in the discussions on the Company's new business development and DX promotion, leveraging digital technology and AI, and R&D strategy.\n\nI have also served as an outside director for a number of companies in many different industries that are at various stages of management and governance transformation. I think that those experiences have allowed me to have a relative perspective on each company and be more objective in judging the situation. I hope to make use of my experience in a variety of opportunities, including examining the Company's management styles and strategies, improving its corporate governance, and implementing materiality management in the Company.\n\nFor the development of a sustainable society, it is essential to reduce the environmental impact of business activities and actively implement measures to combat climate change, such as reducing CO2 emissions and recycling waste plastics. However, that is not everything. By utilizing our strengths in science and technology (S&T), we can create innovative pharmaceuticals for new infectious diseases and other new disorders that could arise from changes in the structure of diseases due to ongoing global warming and other factors. Furthermore, I believe we can contribute to the society more by providing a stable supply of those products to the world and thereby reassuring medical professionals treating patients.\n\nI expect Daiichi Sankyo to build a system to detect the signs of new disease outbreaks and create advanced preventive and therapeutic drugs in a faster manner. To this end, we need to step up our efforts to promote research in various modalities, develop specialized and diverse human resources while promoting their activities, and expand our investment capacity with enhanced global management capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I studied medicine-not only the natural sciences but also the humanities and social sciences-and have provided medical care. During that time, I studied public health (epidemiology, statistics, environmental medicine, behavioral science, health policy management, etc.) in the United States, and also engaged in university and hospital administration and management. A critical part of administrating and managing a university or a hospital is personnel administration and human resource development. In my past experiences, this process sometimes went better than expected; on the other hand, there were several times I wished it had been done differently.\n\nWith this academic background and experience in healthcare delivery and organizational management, I hope to contribute when we consider significant corporate decisions from all possible perspectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate entities and every one of us are expected to have economic activities and lifestyles that will help achieve a sustainable society, and this can be characterized by the keywords: SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance). Daiichi Sankyo has determined priority issues (materiality) based on these perspectives, set specific targets for achieving them, and integrated them into management. Therefore, we should monitor our contribution to the SDGs as we progress toward the targets.\n\nOur priorities lie in the Company's missions to deliver health and welfare and to bring job satisfaction and economic growth. In addition to these, I believe that Daiichi Sankyo can adopt clean energy in the stages of pharmaceutical processing and research to address climate change (reduce carbon dioxide emissions). In the future, I also expect Daiichi Sankyo to contribute part of its profits to the eradication of poverty and hunger.\n\n## Aiming for Governance with Both Aggressive and Defensive Approaches and Bringing Out the Best in Each Employee\n\nKazuaki Kama Outside Director (Independent Director)\n\nPlease tell us what you expect from Daiichi Sankyo and what should be strengthened in order for us to contribute to the development of a sustainable society.\n\nPlease tell us about your role based on the skill matrix.\n\nI believe that Outside Directors are expected to contribute to Daiichi Sankyo's sustainable growth and enhancement of its corporate value. This fiscal year is the first year of the new 5-year business plan. We have started implementing measures to realize our FY2025 Vision 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology.'\n\nTo support the implementation of the measures, I intend to utilize my experience and knowledge as an executive officer in a comprehensive heavy industry manufacturer and my expertise and practical experience in finance and accounting. To this end, I will fulfill the two roles of governance in a well-balanced manner: 'aggressive' governance to drive measures and 'defensive' governance to verify risks and internal control effectiveness.\n\nThe measures and timetables for achieving our FY2025 Vision are all set. Now it is vital that we follow the PDCA cycle of the measures without fail.\n\nAnother thing to address is risks. As we have witnessed pandemics represented by the recent outbreak of COVID-19, large-scale natural disasters, and geopolitical risks, the probability of such occurrences is rising, and the magnitude of resulting losses is even more significant than in the past. This requires us to execute thorough risk management practices and take appropriate actions in a crisis.\n\nIt is up to each and every employee of the Group working on the global stage to attain the new 5-year business plan's goals. There is and will be a dramatic change in our work styles during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we need to create an environmental system that allows each employee to demonstrate their abilities fully.",

However, once a severe incident is allowed to happen, even if we resolved it quickly, there is no hope of 100 percent recovery from that damage, not only in terms of human lives but also economic losses. Enhancing the ability to respond to incidents after the occurrence and preparing equipment and materials are undoubtedly important, but there is no better way than to prevent them from happening. The Japanese police have endeavored to thoroughly analyze the causes of incidents and accidents, painstakingly preparing a social environment that prevents such causes from developing. In my view, those efforts have led Japan to the healthiest and safest country in the world.\n\nFor Daiichi Sankyo, as a leading global healthcare company, to contribute to the development of a sustainable society, we need to build an advanced governance process that can deal with complex and diversified risks. I believe that the methods used to prevent accidents and incidents can also be a viable solution to risk management. At present, many companies start managing risks as soon as they are aware of their existence. However, if we catch them further in advance and nip them in the bud, many risks should not be materializing.\n\nThe process up to the materialization of risk varies depending on each case, but human factors are always involved. As I see it, the key to nipping risks in the bud is to enhance personnel administration and business management with a focus on those in charge of critical operations that could have serious consequences if the risk manifested itself. From that perspective, I would like to utilize my knowledge on the process of developing society so that Audit & Supervisory Board may contribute to enhancing the Company's corporate governance further.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sound corporate management requires enhancing the internal autonomous and self-cleansing functions and examining the situation from an external, third-party perspective. As the unstable situation caused by COVID-19 continues, it is increasingly important to develop diverse talent who can create competitive edge and advantage. Furthermore, encouraging these people to play an active part is also essential. Leveraging my experiences in corporate legal affairs and corporate governance with a focus on labor and employment cases as a lawyer, I, as an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member of the Company, will continuously strive to contribute to establishing good corporate governance in response to the public trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to fulfill our mission of contributing to the enrichment of quality of life around the world through the creation of innovative pharmaceuticals, and through the provision of pharmaceuticals addressing diverse medical needs, the Company must be flexible to meet the needs of the times. Our current 5-year business plan aims to realize the 2025 Vision, 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology,' while shifting to the growth stage toward achieving the 2030 Vision. We have also established a new global management structure to become a truly global healthcare company.\n\nHowever, when a company tries to make a change, not only opportunities but also risks will arise. An Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member in the capacity of a lawyer is expected to contribute to providing a sense of security to shareholders and increasing corporate value of the Company. In order to achieve these, I will always offer objective opinions from an auditor's view in accordance from the legal mind and a neutral stance, so that unnecessary legal risks and damages to corporate value will be avoided. I will continue to endeavor to secure compliance and sound management of the Company in pursuit of its sustainable growth.\n\n## Contributing as a Corporate Accounting and Auditing Professional for Further Improvement of Corporate Governance\n\nMasako Watanabe Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member (Independent Auditor)\n\nPlease tell us about your role based on your experience and expertise.\n\nI was elected as a Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member at the general meeting of shareholders held in June 2021. With the global spread of COVID-19, the role played by pharmaceutical companies and society's expectations of them have never been greater. Under these unprecedented circumstances, I have renewed my determination since becoming an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board of Daiichi Sankyo, a company that is making groupwide efforts to become an advanced global drug discovery company.\n\nI have been working as a certified public accountant for 30 years at an auditing firm, where I have conducted accounting audits and financial investigations in a number of industries and business categories. In the course of my work, I have faced various management issues and fraud cases arising from corporate governance systems and internal control systems.\n\nEach time such a problem occurred, I confronted and discussed it with the company's side, such as the management and auditors. In this way, I have come to recognize the importance of a corporate governance system. From this experience, I would like to speak my opinions actively in various aspects as a corporate auditor and also as a specialist in corporate accounting and auditing. I will strive for further improvement of the Company's corporate governance system. I will also work closely with the Internal Audit Department, Accounting Auditors, and Group companies' auditors to audit the functioning of internal control systems. I will commit to the continuous improvement of the Group's corporate value.\n\nPlease tell us about your aspirations as a new Audit & Supervisory Board Member.\n\nI hope to fulfill my role as a Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member by better understanding the Company's business and actual conditions. Therefore, I would like to exchange opinions with Audit & Supervisory Board Members who are actively engaged in their roles. I would also like to conduct direct interviews with each department and site visits to R&D and manufacturing sites as necessary. I look forward to working for Daiichi Sankyo.",

In addition to these activities, we have launched two screening projects for therapeutic drugs for malaria.\n\n## To Protect People from Infectious Diseases\n\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, we have launched a task force to promote research and development of vaccines and therapeutic agents on a Group-wide scale. In the meantime, we re-recognized the need for a system which can quickly respond to new pandemics and AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance) issues that are expected to occur in the future. To further activate research & development of anti-infective agents, we established the Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases Research Special Team (EReDS) in April 2021 and started activities. Creating novel drugs is a unique contribution that pharmaceutical companies can make. We will contribute to the development of sustainable society by maintaining the foundation of infectious disease research, passing on internal knowledge and knowhow, and creating novel drugs in the field of infectious diseases while leveraging our group's strength in drug discovery and promoting industrygovernment-academia cooperation.\n\nConsortium, which aims to acquire novel compounds with antibacterial activity by using the chemical libraries of the respective companies.\n\nIn July 2020, Daiichi Sankyo decided to participate in and contribute US$20 million to the AMR Action Fund, which was established to support the clinical development of new antibiotics and to realize a sustainable antibiotics market. Through the participation in the Fund, we will promote the development of innovative antibiotics and contribute to the prompt resolution of AMR issues around the world.",

We established the 'Daiichi Sankyo Group Quality Policy' as a superior global policy for all the Daiichi Sankyo Group companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethical Marketing Practices\n\nIn addition to establishing our code in the Company and group companies in Japan and group companies outside of Japan in accordance with the industry code of each country and territory in which we operate based on the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations Code of Practice ('IFPMA Code'), we established the 'Daiichi Sankyo Group Global Marketing Code of Conduct' on October 1, 2016, as a global policy with the aim of maintaining a high level of standard when interacting with healthcare professionals, medical institutions, and patient organizations as well as promoting pharmaceutical products.\n\nIn this policy, we clearly state that relationships between the Company and each Group company and healthcare professionals must be maintained for the purpose of improving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMiyuki Kurihara Ethics & Compliance Group, Legal Affairs Department, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction of Global Hotline\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo Group operates the hotline (a reporting channel) to foster an ethical culture in which all employees are encouraged to openly discuss what is right and what is wrong at their workplace.t. The global hotline newly introduced is available to persons outside the Daiichi Sankyo Group as well as employees of the Group companies in Japan and overseas for reporting and consultation in 19 languages, including Japanese and English. The global hotline also centrally manages consultations and inquiries regarding compliance on a global basis, through which we believe that we can identify allegations at the Daiichi Sankyo Group more comprehensively and take appropriate measures. However, we understand that introducing the global hotline cannot be achieved the intended purpose without employees' understanding the importance and fully utilizing it. We will continue our efforts to effectively operate the global hotline by communicating the protection of reporters and consulters as well as the purpose and importance of it to employees.\n\nfor the purpose of building a system to be transmitted quality information to all levels of the organization in a timely and accurate manner, and to commit management and/or all employees to consistently address quality and compliance issues. By strengthening quality governance and the quality mindset, we will promote that every single employee including executives recognize the responsibility for quality and act autonomously, as well as maintain and continuously improve an effective quality system throughout the lifecycle of pharmaceutical products, from the development stage to launch and termination., which will contribute to the Daiichi Sankyo Group's materiality 'Providing a stable supply of top-quality pharmaceutical products,' 'Providing the highest quality medical information' and 'Promoting Compliance Management.'\n\nthe quality of healthcare, with a focus on providing information on pharmaceutical products to healthcare professionals, providing scientific and educational information, and supporting medical research and education.\n\nIn line with the revision of the IFPMA Code in January 2019, we revised the policy, prohibiting the provision of gifts and promotional aids to healthcare professionals, etc. We also prohibit the provision of entertainment, cash, and other personal gifts and stipulates stricter terms and conditions of contract in cases where we pay remuneration to healthcare professionals as well as the appropriateness of the remuneration. In this way, we promote appropriate marketing practices in accordance with the IFPMA Code.",

        "page_content": "## Promoting Environmental Management\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo Group recognizes that environmental issues, including global warming and extreme weather, are worldwide issues which have impacts on our work and life, and we also understand that climate change is a risk that may affect our long-term business foundations such as, for example, a stable supply of pharmaceuticals. We work to promote environmental management based on these and we believe that doing so contributes to a resilient and sustainable society and helps build long-term corporate business foundations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures for Climate Change\n\nThe EHS Management Policy (FY2021-FY2025) states that we should 'Lower the environmental impact of the entire supply chain by conserving energy and resources, or reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste,' thereby promoting environmental management.\n\nTo facilitate responsible corporate activities that address climate change, we have set the goal of reducing CO2 emissions in FY2025, the final year of the 5-year business plan, by 25% compared to FY2015, in order to achieve our long-term CO2 emissions target of 37.5% reduction (a target well below 2\u00b0C* 1 ) in FY2030 based on the approach of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)* 2 , which aims to help accomplish the goal of the Paris Agreement* 3 of keeping the average increase in global temperature below 2\u00b0C. This CO2 emissions target is certified by SBTi, and the Company has participated in the Decarbonization Management Promotion Network established by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment and cooperated in the Ministry of the Environment's SBT promotional activities.\n\nIn FY2020, the Daiichi Sankyo Chemical Pharma Onahama Plant started to operate a solar power system (3.3 megawatts of power output) in December 2020, which is one of the largest self-consumption power systems in the pharmaceutical industry in Japan. The plant reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 470 tons in FY2020 and is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 1,800 tons per year. The Daiichi Sankyo Europe Pfaffenhofen Plant has also installed power and will start operation in FY2021. The plant is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 350 tons per year. We are actively advancing the use of renewable energy overseas in other sites, including Europe and Brazil that have also expanded the use of renewable energy.\n\nOur CO2 emissions for FY2020 were 182,865 tons (19.4% lower than in FY2015). We have worked on not only 'actions to mitigate' CO2 emissions but also 'actions to adapt' to influence\n\nfrom climate change that is inevitable in the medium- to longterm, including weather-related disasters that have apparently become more and more serious in recent years and in particular, flood damage, etc. which is a serious risk.\n\nIf rivers near research facilities and plants of the Daiichi Sankyo Group overflow, the Group companies in Japan could also be forced to suspend operations due to flood damage. Therefore, we are preparing for emergencies through initiatives such as the development of flood control manuals, etc. while assessing potential flooding risk at our research facilities and plants and identifying measures to minimize the most significant damage to property such as transformation units and outdoor facilities and injury.\n\nWe will plan for weather-related disasters as part of our business continuity plan to ensure a stable supply of pharmaceutical products.\n\n- *1 A target stricter than the target of 2\u00b0C set by SBTi in 2019.\n- *2  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): An international initiative that encourages companies to set CO2 reduction targets based on scientific evidence in order to help accomplish the goal of the Paris Agreement of keeping the average increase in global temperature below 2\u00b0C.\n- *3  A legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015.\n\n## CO2 Emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnahama Plant: the onsite solar power system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Promoting Environmental Management\n\nRead more here.\n\nhttps://www.daiichisankyo.com/sustainability/the\\_environment/policy-system/",

We conducted a scenario analysis and publicized\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate Change Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe results in FY2020. Furthermore, our climate-related risks and opportunities based on the TCFD recommendations we carried out are reflected in the environmental targets and plans in the current 5-year business plan (FY2021-FY2025), including promotion of the use of renewable energy and measures for flood damage risk, etc. of weather-related disasters becoming more or more serious in recent years as set forth on the left.\n\nWe will further improve climate change-related risk analysis and disclose more information in line with the progress of the current 5-year business plan.\n\n- * Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n\nhttps://www.daiichisankyo.com/sustainability/the\\_environment/climate\\_strategy/#ancol\n\nRead more here.\n\n## Measures for Environmental Risk\n\nBecause our member companies handle various chemical substances, the Daiichi Sankyo Group considers proper management of chemical substances as an important initiative and issue. To prevent air and water pollution, our plants in Japan have established voluntary control standards that are stricter than legal requirements and properly control the emissions at plants and research facilities in Group companies in Japan. Similar, Group company plants outside Japan also regularly monitor their emissions to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region.\n\nWith the purpose of assessing the impact of water discharged from operation sites on the ecosystem, in FY2020, we continued to conduct WET testing* at all plants and research facilities in Japan (seven operation sites). As a result, we confirmed that the discharged water has no serious impact on aquatic organisms in rivers, etc. In FY2021, we plan to conduct annual WET testing as usual and additional testing depending on changes in wastewater load at all of our plants and research facilities in Japan to promote appropriate wastewater management and improve the quality of discharged water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Efficient Use of Resources\n\nWe have established waste reduction and more efficient use of resources as important issues. Consequently, we seek to save resources through efforts such as the streamlining of resources used in manufacturing processes, the comprehensive separation of unnecessary and waste materials, the reduction of the total volume of unnecessary and waste material, and resource recycling. Whenever possible, we choose waste disposal firms that recycle thoroughly. In response to the continued focus on the problem of plastic waste, we have actively promoted waste recycling and increased the recycling rate of plastic (the percentage of the amount recycled to the total amount of waste generated) from 38.6% in FY2019 to 52.0% in FY2020. Under the current 5-year business plan, we will address the waste plastic problem and promote waste recycling by setting the target of 70% or more of the waste plastic recycling rate as a Materiality KPI. With respect to the use of water, we consider the ability to utilize a sufficient amount of good quality freshwater in the value chain to be extremely important to continue business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJunichi Takanashi General Administration Department (right) Yoshiaki Konrai Onahama Plant (left) Daiichi Sankyo Chemical Pharma Co., Ltd.\n\n- *  Whole Effluent Toxicity Test. A testing method that utilizes the biological responses of fish, daphnia, and seaweed to determine the total toxicity of discharged water.\n\nWhile promoting efficient use of water, the Daiichi Sankyo Group has identified, by using the WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter, three plants in total in China and Brazil as being located in high water risk areas. We are paying attention to regulatory trends and making an effort to further optimize water usage in these areas. Specific measures include using recycled water for sprinklers and using rainwater for sanitary water and other daily usages.\n\n## Waste Generated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creation of Environmental Value through Energy Generation\n\nIn 2018, we conducted the largest scale construction work of a plant at Onahama Plant involving the construction of new buildings, demolition of existing buildings and renewal of power transformer units at the same time as the launch of the solar power system introduction project. In December 2020, such new solar power system in Onahama Plant started operation while we were advancing transformation to the fields of oncology and bio-pharmaceuticals. We believe that the construction of Onahama Plant contributed to the reinforcement of the Daiichi Sankyo Group's environmental management.\n\nOur conventional energy saving initiatives have been focused on reducing energy use. An action by generating energy using a renewable energy system was a new challenge for us, which involved cooperation and collaboration of many related parties.\n\nBased on this experience, we will examine further actions to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and we believe that we can expect to extend the example of Onahama Plant to other plants of Group companies as the model of environmentally advanced plants.",

We respect diversity and work to realize the mutual long-term growth of the company and the employees who act based on our Core Values of Innovation, Integrity and Accountability. We realize this by encouraging them to have a high level of engagement and contribution.\n\n## Cultivate Employees with Highly Competitive Skills\n\nWe define our human resource management under the Daiichi Sankyo Group HR Management Philosophy, fairly treating employees covered by our Core Values wherever they may be in the world, developing their talent and helping them make maximum use of it. Furthermore, by providing our employees opportunities to work with colleagues globally as well as opportunities for rotational assignments among our locations in different countries and regions to experience different cultures as well as different ways of working and thinking. This will enhance an environment globally in which diversity is respected and in that way, we generate a competitive advantage that benefits our global business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting the Success and Development of a Diverse Range of People Who Create Our Competitive Advantages\n\nFor the companies comprising the Daiichi Sankyo Group to evolve into a'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantages in Oncology', the Group needs to keep delivering the values that only it can create, while adapting to environmental changes both inside and outside of the Group. We expect that our employees fulfill their potential, even in such changing environments, and also grow at work.\n\nBased on the idea that our business is built on the growth of our employees, we have sought to provide them with more opportunities to take on challenges in multiple business areas through job rotation. For example, we launched the Create Our Future (COF) project in Japan in 2017 based on the principle of focusing on the success of our employees. In the COF project, we assigned a total of 803 employees to our priority areas, including oncology and bio-pharmaceuticals, over the three years up to April 2020.\n\nOn top of this project, we have implemented a Career Development Program (CDP) in Japan, a systematic framework to balance the growth of individuals and the development of the Group, to enhance our career development efforts.\n\nFor this CDP program, we have provided our employees in Japan with information they will need in making career choices, including job descriptions, and expected knowledge, work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promote Global Talent Management\n\nToward realizing our 2030 Vision, we have proactively recruited and employed qualified talents with broad experiences from both outside and inside of the Group. We have also developed a global talent management program to continue to develop leadership candidates. Specifically, we have identified the key positions required for realizing the management vision/mid-term business plan (a total of 20 positions identified as of April 2021) at the global level, ensuring the visibility of successor candidates and challenges surrounding the successor development. In addition, at other levels of the organization, we are also working to promote talent development measures tailored to employees' individual challenges, such as the provision of opportunities and positions that drive their growth, and the provision of training programs, to secure and retain talent. We have also actively provided international assignments and overseas study\n\nexperience and skills required within the various departments, and career path models that provide employees with a clear direction regarding how they can develop their careers and continue to grow into other areas. This is available to our employees in Japan on our internal portal site.\n\nWe have also implemented an Individual Development Plan, a self-fulfillment reporting system for Japan employees. The Plan allows employees to have a clear vision of their future career paths over mid-to-long-term, with various experiences gained through work as the driver for their change and growth. The Plan allows employees to identify their advantages and disadvantages through dialogue (interview) with their supervisors and thus align their envisioned career plans with those of their supervisors, and to help foster their awareness of the need to voluntarily forge their careers.\n\nFurther, to support individual employees who are voluntarily taking on challenges and are striving to improve themselves through autonomous actions, we have worked to enhance the measure for developing employees who are readily adaptable to changing business environments, including providing courses on specialized skills, training programs for career building for each generation, and the planning of DX related education programs (data literacy basics, data analysis applications) for all employees.\n\nprograms to allow future leaders to comprehend global business and expand their knowledge.\n\n## Cumulative Number of Employees Newly Seconded from Japan to Group Companies Outside of Japan\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, we started an audio program in Japanese called 'DS15 (Discovery Station 15)', where employees share ideas and learn from each other, in December 2020. For 15 minutes a day, 4 days a week, dozens of participants in Japan and more-than 80 expatriates at DSI listen to topics on challenges and issues faced by Japanese employees in global and foreign environments including required skillsets, career development, communications issues, and cross-cultural issues.\n\nWe also have a voluntarily managed English conversation class 5 to 6 times on average per week for Japan-based employees and expatriates assigned to DSI. It has been named the 'Speakers' Corner' where about 30 to 50 people think and discuss useful topics for global management in English, including leadership, communication, team management and mindset. When we started a new 'Basic English Class' this year, the 15 Speakers' Corner participants volunteered as teaching facilitators to expand the English learning opportunities for an additional 50+ participants.\n\nWe hold a 'Learning Forum' in English every month, inviting a DSI-based leader to discuss leadership and management challenges based on their experiences. It is attended by more than 100 employees in Japan and expatriates in the US. For DSI employees, we hold periodic 'Bento Club' sessions to introduce Japanese business culture and customs to all DSI employees as well as a mentoring program for those who would like an individual opportunity to learn with a mentor. Finally, we started and plan to expand a 'Global Learning Circle' where employees both in the US and Japan can learn from each other in a small group setting.\n\n## Cross-cultural work experiences in globalizing organizations\n\nOur employees who understand the ways of working in Japan and cultural uniqueness of Daiichi Sankyo can and will be very important influencers and cultural driver toward the future Daiichi Sankyo's organizational culture. Work experiences in cross-cultural and global environments, and in particular how each individual spends time during their overseas assignment, also have significant impacts on personal growth. To really globalize, it is important to expand our overseas assignment programs to include more diverse and multi-directional talent assignments across regions and countries.\n\n## Diverse Workforce\n\nAt Daiichi Sankyo, our leaders develop their own expertise and strength, embrace curiosity to seek for new challenges, and can create an environment where openness and flexibility can generate new and innovative ideas. Even if you physically work in Japan, or no matter which country you live in, there will surely be an increase in opportunities to lead and work with your team members in different countries or regions. The growth of Daiichi Sankyo as well as our individual employee's growth can occur in parallel as we pursue to collectively optimize the organizational performance through the diverse Daiichi Sankyo workforce around the world.",

for balancing work and childcare/ caregiving/medical treatment and related seminars and discussion meetings.

At the same time, the Group also identifies human rights related issues in connection with our business activities from the perspectives of 'Responsibilities as a global pharmaceutical company,' 'Human rights in our supply chain,' and 'Responsibilities in the workplace.'\n\nIn FY2020, we started to conduct human rights due diligence* by setting up an internal team to address human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Implementation of Human Rights Risk Assessment\n\nIn FY2019, the Company conducted human rights risk assessment to examine the status of the risk management in five areas (wages, discrimination/inhumane treatment, human rights in our supply chain, human rights of participants of clinical trials, and access to healthcare).\n\nSubsequently in FY2020, a questionnaire survey was conducted for all group companies conducting business operations.

We will continue to make efforts to avoid a negative impact on human rights, which could occur resulting from our business activities.\n\nAnd from FY2019, the Group has reported the initiatives to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business activities including our supply chain in accordance with the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n\n- *  A framework to assess, identify, prevent and mitigate any actual or potential human rights risks arising from our business activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Contents of the Questionnaire\n\n| Item                                    | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dissemination of  human rights policies | Status of Human Rights Policy dissemination,  Status of implementation of trainings related to  human rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Address to human  rights issues         | Forced labor and human trafficking, Child labor,  Discrimination, Freedom of association and  collective bargaining rights, Working hours, Wage  and employment contract, Inhumane treatment,  Privacy, Negative impact on local communities,  Health and safety, Considerations for human  rights in research and development |\n| Management                              | Stakeholder engagement, Operation of reporting  channels, Status of responsible procurement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nA general compliance training including certain aspects of human rights has been issued within the group companies in the United States, and a training on the German Equal Treatment Act for people managers for group companies in Europe (Germany)\n\nWe will continue to conduct awareness raising activities on human rights.",

The Group takes a broad definition of diversity which includes not only protected categories such as, for example, nationality, gender, race, age and other personal attributes, but also the different specialties and approaches as well as values and lifestyle required for each job. We believe that if all employees of the Group actively accept each other's diversity, they will exhibit their abilities to the greatest extent possible, which, as a result, will contribute to the development of global business and the creation of innovation. Based on this idea, we engage in initiatives to foster a culture of mutual respect among employees.\n\nAs a global initiative, we promote 'Creating ONE DS Culture Through Fostering Our Core Behaviors,' which is included in the strategic pillars of the current 5-year business plan.\n\n'Be Inclusive & Embrace Diversity' is one of the Three Core Behaviors, which will be embedded across the entire group companies, and means that the Group achieves larger goals through incorporating diverse perspectives into work while valuing each person.

As digital transformation is accelerating, the environment will change in the next ten years faster than that in the previous ten years. Similarly, the healthcare environment may dramatically change.\n\nHowever, no matter how much the healthcare environment changes, the basis of our activities is to 'contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' which is our purpose. We always aim to be an ethical, trusted, and respectful partner, and continue to contribute to healthcare.\n\nWe will strive to contribute to healthcare in Japan as the number one company in Japan by appropriately responding to all the customers' needs including treatment and prevention of diseases and medical cost reduction. For this, we pursue comprehensive business development. This includes the innovative pharmaceuticals business, vaccine business, and the generic business.\n\n## Strengths to be leveraged/enhanced for sustainable growth Strategies/initiatives to address the challenges\n\nWe believe that one of our strengths in the innovative pharmaceuticals business is trust from healthcare professionals.\n\nWe cover a wide range of therapeutic agents such as those for cardiovascular diseases including thromboembolism; lifestyle-related diseases; diseases related to the central nervous system including migraine headache and epilepsy; and diseases related to pain. With the aim of total care focusing on patients, we provide healthcare professionals with useful, thorough, and correct information quickly. As a result, we have continuously been ranked No.1 for MR evaluation conducted by an external organization for years.\n\nIn 2020, we launched Enhertu in Japan, and expanded our business to the oncology field. We endeavor to provide doctors with thorough information on not only cancer therapy but also any possible subject such as complication and comorbidity so that they can select the best therapy for each patient. This is the sales approach we are pursuing, and it is what we can do as we have a wide range of pharmaceuticals. Trust from healthcare professionals cannot be gained overnight. We will make efforts to further enhance our sales capabilities so that we can provide higherlevel information, in a timely manner and in a form required, to respond to a wide range of ever-changing needs based on experience in the primary care field we have built. With such efforts, we strive to be the most trusted healthcare partner also in the oncology field.\n\nWe aim to achieve a top level of sales in Japan and continue to grow. To achieve this, it is important that we strive to conduct activities to enhance the value of our products including maintaining drug prices to fit the product value as well as revisions of guidelines through evidence generation and dissemination and application of additional indications and dosage forms. In particular, we will collect, analyze, and evaluate unmet medical needs to strengthen the system of generating and disseminating evidence at an advanced level in the oncology field.\n\nAt the same time, facing the threat of infectious disease around the world, we recognize that our vaccine business has a large social responsibility. We strive to fulfill the responsibility of stably providing vaccines we produce. In addition, we will contribute to the society by promoting the development of vaccines that protect against emerging and re-emerging infections and developing a vaccine supply system to respond to future pandemic threats. Today, the generic business plays a role in the improvement of the medical insurance system in Japan. We continue to stably provide high quality generic medicines that not only reduce the economic burden of patients but also have features. These include authorized generics and medicines with formulation, labelling, and packaging innovations that are easy to swallow but hard to swallow accidentally. Furthermore, we will continue to provide pharmaceuticals considering patients and their families as well as healthcare professionals.",

Since joining Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. in 2014, he has shifted the structure of the U.S. business to focus on launching multiple oncology therapeutics in the coming years. Through his work with Daiichi Sankyo, and prior to that with Amgen Inc., Mr. Keller has more than 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. He is known for his inclusive leadership approach and his passion for bringing innovative drugs to patients in need.\n\n## Business environment projection and the unit's vision in 2030\n\nThe Oncology Business Unit (OBU) is committed to achieving Daiichi Sankyo's 2030 Vision to become an 'innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society.' By aligning our U.S. and European oncology businesses and global oncology functions together under the new OBU in April 2021, we are now one unified team singularly devoted to people with cancer. As we look to become a top leader in oncology - we will do so by launching our three lead ADCs across a dozen indications in 30 countries potentially benefitting more than 50,000 people worldwide by 2025. The field of oncology moves fast; our OBU will allow Daiichi Sankyo to move at the speed in which the oncology field innovates; accelerating our decision making and increasing our agility to respond to the rapid changes we see in standards of care, treatment and diagnoses patterns, and payer dynamics, ultimately making us well positioned to realize the 2030 Vision. Together, and in collaboration with the rest of the organization, the OBU will bring an unprecedented focus to the delivery of our oncology medicines to patients around the world.\n\n## Strengths to be leveraged/enhanced for sustainable growth Strategies/initiatives to address the challenges\n\nAchieving our long-term 2030 Vision and contributing to sustainable growth requires us to work collaboratively within the OBU as well across the organization to deliver on Daiichi Sankyo's global purpose to bring life-changing medicines to patients, customers and society overall. Our ADC pipeline has the potential to transform the current standard of care across multiple types of cancer including breast, lung, colorectal, gastric and more. We know the needs of the oncology community continue to rapidly change - from diagnosis patterns to standards of care. We must continue to evolve and adapt - operating with agility and simplicity - to deliver for our patients and customers. This is what we have done with Enhertu \u00ae and Turalio \u00ae - leading to their successful growth to date.\n\nWe are pleased with the overall adoption of Enhertu , as market share continues to grow quarter over quarter. Since our initial launch in December 2019, we have a more robust understanding of how Enhertu is being utilized in the real world with experience from approximately 5,000 patients receiving treatment. Our core strategy is to provide a strong support system enabling the appropriate use of Enhertu for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting, and for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen and educating healthcare professionals on the management of interstitial lung disease associated with Enhertu .\n\nSince launching Turalio in 2019, both medical oncologists and orthopedic oncologists have been receptive to using it to treat appropriate patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). Moving forward, we are concentrating our efforts on educating stakeholders about the disease, given it is a very rare disease and awareness has been very low, in addition to the risks and benefits of Turalio . We are also connecting physicians and patients to Sarcoma Centers of Excellence, helping to ensure that these providers are trained and REMS-certified to prescribe Turalio to appropriate patients.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that people are at the heart of our business, whether it is the patients, customers or employees. It's our obligation and responsibility to deliver our medicines to patients and we have an incredible team of people within the OBU and across Daiichi Sankyo working collaboratively to make this happen. Together we will achieve our 2030 Vision.",

A medical doctor by education, Jan joined the pharmaceutical industry at Cilag Benelux (a Johnson & Johnson Company) in 1989. After a short period in medical affairs, he moved to marketing and sales. From 1996 he was Janssen-Cilag Hungary's General Manager. At Novartis, from 2000, Jan was county president in South Africa. In 2005 he joined Grunenthal where he worked as General manager Spain and Iberia and as Head of Latin America till joining Daiichi Sankyo in 2012. Throughout his career Jan's focus has been on driving profitable growth by restlessly focusing on customer needs and creating customer centric organizations.\n\n## Business environment projection and the unit's vision in 2030\n\nHistorically, Daiichi Sankyo in Europe focused on cardiovascular products which enabled us to become true experts in this area. Based on this wealth of experience, capabilities, and customer understanding, we defined our aspiration accordingly: 'We want to be recognized as the benchmark for patient and customer centricity through delivering the best customer experience.' Our ambitious goal is to exceed our customers' expectations. We want to achieve this by designing and delivering on customer experience collaboratively. Thus, we will be able to increase customer satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy which will be the driver for sustainable growth and contribute to our company's 2030 vision.\n\nFrom a European perspective we also appreciate the 2030 vision's focus on our role in society. With environmental, social and access aspects becoming increasingly important, we are keen on contributing our part. Elements are the further reduction of our environmental impact, e.g. by using solar energy at our Pfaffenhofen site or by actively shaping a culture that fosters Inclusion & Diversity to make sure everybody can thrive at Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n## Strengths to be leveraged/enhanced for sustainable growth Strategies/initiatives to address the challenges\n\nBecoming the benchmark for patient and customer centricity requires us to constantly learn and adapt. We must evolve together with our customers and always be aware of their needs and current and future challenges. This requires us to change our mindset and to constantly ask ourselves whether we are still on the right track. While not everything we do is and will be digital, digital capabilities will nevertheless help us to tackle these challenges.\n\nDigital tools offer enormous opportunities, e.g., based on data analytics we can better tailor our offers. By gaining a deeper understanding of what our customers require to make the right decisions for their patients. we are better able to use the limited time we have with them. The pandemic served as a catalyst for this development. We established a Digital Excellence group in our Specialty business which focusses on exactly this: how can we use digital solutions to better understand and address customers' and patients' needs.\n\nPart of this journey also includes changing to a bespoke omnichannel go-tomarket model for us to offer a unified customer experience.\n\nOur cardiovascular portfolio is also an opportunity since it allows us to create synergies at customer level and be recognized as a partner of choice.\n\nIn addition, this portfolio approach helps us to be more efficient. While our\n\nanticoagulant\n\nLixiana\n\n\u00ae\n\n(edoxaban) is advancing in its life cycle, we can put our\n\ncapabilities and capacities to very good use with\n\nNilemdo\n\n\u00ae\n\n/\n\nNustendi\n\n\u00ae\n\n(bempedoic\n\nacid/ bempedoic acid with ezetimibe). Applying our resources across our\n\ncardiovascular portfolio, thus increasing return on investment, allows for\n\nreinvestments into other growth areas and future opportunities for further sustainable\n\ngrowth of the entire company.\n\nAll of this is only possible with the best people. Only people who are engaged, inspired, and dedicated will be able to deliver the best customer experience to fully realize the potential of our current product portfolio - people with the right mindset, values, and behaviors with an emphasis on commitment to customers and a collaborative and agile way of working, as well as empowerment and diversity. Attracting, retaining, and developing this talent is key for the success of our Specialty business in Europe.",

For two years from 2014, he was in charge of clinical development and regulatory affairs of Asian countries except for Japan.\n\n## Business environment projection and the unit's vision in 2030\n\nThere are situations that the policies of drug price control are strengthened for products including long-listed products since the national health insurance finances is under pressure in the countries in Asia, South & Central America (ASCA). Such policies include VBP* in China. On the other hand, the oncology market in the ASCA countries is expected to grow significantly. Especially, there is a possibility that China becomes the largest market. We aim to 'contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' which is our purpose, by delivering our oncology products to more patients as quickly as possible.\n\nWe will strive to grow Daiichi Sankyo's presence globally by continuously launching the new products in the primary care and oncology fields, and by increasing the market share of Lixiana . We aim to double our sales and profits in the next ten years to strengthen the business of Daiichi Sankyo in Asia and South & Central America.\n\n## Strengths to be leveraged/enhanced for sustainable growth Strategies/initiatives to address the challenges\n\nASCA Business Unit is responsible for export business for our partners as well as our own business activities of seven group companies in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Brazil. Every country has a different environment but each of the group companies has secured favorable sales and profits even after patent expiration of the products through their professional promotional activities with strong brand awareness in the primary care business. As a whole, the unit has steadily grown since its establishment in 2010.\n\nRecently, however, as there is a large impact from countries' policies of drug price control, business transformation and continuous launches of new products are required. To respond to this, we have been working hard to establish the system and basis in each country for the oncology business which is expected to be our growth engine and expand our presence. We aim to launch new products in China within two years after their launch in the U.S. by accelerating the development in China. For this, we will reshape the development function in China and enhance our collaboration with related functions. We also aim to expand our footprints to deliver oncology drugs to more patients as quickly as we can.\n\nWe will maximumly expand business with a focus on appropriately capturing changes in each of the market; enhancing our strength, relationships between Daiichi Sankyo and stakeholders; and using digital and smart marketing. In addition, we will strengthen the business platform of each group company through measures such as licensing-in the products both in the primary care and oncology fields considering the portfolios as well as improving the efficiency of promotional activities. In China, as there is a significant impact from VBP, a certain degree of the decrease in sales and profits of the products selected for VBP might be unavoidable. We will try to enhance sales and secure profits by selecting appropriate sales channels and customer segments in light of the characteristics of our products and market needs.\n\nDuring the period under the current 5-year business plan, we continuously focus on primary care business where the products like Lixiana are major contributor to the ASCA business. At the same time, we intend to make substantial investment in the oncology business so that it can expand the business in the ASCA regions in 2026 and beyond. Further, we make our best efforts to contribute to Daiichi Sankyo's 2030 vision by continuously uncover unmet needs in each country and responding to those needs.",

Paul has spent the past 13 years committed to implementing significant investments in the company's facilities, equipment, people, and practices, including a state-of-the-art manufacturing expansion with a capacity to help millions of patients. His leadership in modernizing manufacturing operations led to promotions of increasing responsibility since he joined the company in 2008. Prior to joining American Regent, he served as Director of Engineering at Altana Pharmaceuticals for 10 years.\n\n## Business environment projection and the unit's vision in 2030\n\nAmerican Regent, Inc. (ARI) employs over 1,150 people in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Altkirch, France. We are a leading injectable medication specialty pharmaceutical company. The company has a long history of supplying a variety of drugs including branded IV iron, high quality injectable generics, and veterinary medicines, primarily to the U.S. marketplace. ARI will continue to strive for year-overyear revenue growth. Growth will be a multi-faceted approach, including continued focus on strong compliance, generic complex development, international expansion, portfolio optimization for CapEx utilization, Animal Health business growth and partnership through business development and M&A. Most importantly, success will be driven by strong compliance, cGMP focus, a culture of teamwork/collaboration, employee focus and care for patients.\n\n## Strengths to be leveraged/enhanced for sustainable growth Strategies/initiatives to address the challenges\n\nARI's product portfolio is comprised of an iron injection franchise with two leading products, Venofer \u00ae and Injectafer \u00ae , for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, a generic injectable franchise with a portfolio of difficult-to-manufacture, sole-sourced, and competitively differentiated products, and a rapidly growing branded Animal Health injectable franchise. Our largest challenge is patent expiration of Injectafer in 2028 with a mitigation strategy of extending through the indication of Heart-FID clinical trials.\n\nTaking advantage of our capabilities to develop difficult-to-manufacture and complex products, we continue to expand our portfolio of competitive products. Our broad portfolio of more than 30 marketed products is constantly evolving to meet our customers' needs and stay ahead of the dynamic generic marketplace.\n\nThe iron injection franchise focuses on two products: Venofer, which is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA) resulting from chronic kidney disease, and Injectafer, which is indicated to treat IDA resulting from chronic kidney disease, as well as from various other causes, but cannot be used in patients undergoing dialysis.\n\nDue to its ability to treat a wide range of conditions and the convenience of being able to completely dose patients in only two administrations, Injectafer has enjoyed a rapid growth in market share since it was launched. To achieve further growth, Injectafer has increased its voice to meet GI and OB/GYN customer needs and continued awareness among dissatisfied oral iron patients.\n\nThese two products boast a combined share of the U.S. iron injection market of more than 70%, making ARI the undisputed leader in this market. With regard to life cycle management and expanded indications, Injectafer is currently enrolling a HEARTFID clinical study. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of iron therapy using Injectafer relative to placebo in treating patients with heart failure, iron deficiency, and a reduced ejection fraction.\n\nARI manufactures, markets, and supplies generic injectable products in vial and ampule presentations. The company has been launching new products continuously and successfully to achieve sustainable growth. ARI is focused on product development and successful submission of multiple supplemental and new drug applications in FY2021 and beyond, targeting a minimum of 5 filings and 5 product launches per year.
