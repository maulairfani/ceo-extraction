At CEMEX, that uncertainty and the challenges it posed brought out the best in our people. It also revealed the essential nature of our products and services, the value we bring to our customers, and the strength and resiliency of our business.\n\nAs soon as the COVID-19 threat emerged, we activated Rapid Response Teams to swiftly adapt to the new conditions and introduce preventive measures within CEMEX. We focused on three priorities: (1) protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, our contractors, customers, and suppliers, and the communities in which we operate; (2) continuing to serve our customers both safely and reliably by leveraging our digital technologies; and (3) strengthening our liquidity position through various bold actions.\n\nRegarding our first priority, in accordance with global, national, and local health authority recommendations, CEMEX developed and implemented more than 50 strict hygiene and safety protocols to mitigate the risk of\n\ncontagion throughout our worldwide sites and operations. As many governments designated construction to be an essential service, our proactive approach to health and safety enabled us to contribute substantially to the important role that the construction industry has in building and maintaining the critical infrastructure required to face the challenges of the pandemic, and to lead economic recovery going forward. This was also instrumental to the success and continuity of our operations.\n\nWe also provided wide support to our communities during the pandemic, including providing humanitarian aid, organizing voluntary donations, sanitizing outdoor public health areas, and widely distributing the antibacterial disinfectant we produced in some of our plants.\n\nWe are grateful to our employees who have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 and adjusted their work habits to act safely and effectively while still delivering results. Regretfully, we have lost treasured colleagues during this unprecedented pandemic. We recognize these individuals and their significant contributions to the company and extend our deepest sympathies to their families and friends.",

We attained a low level of employee lost-time injuries (LTIs) for the sector and made progress across most of our countries, resulting in 96% of our operations reaching zero fatalities and LTIs.\n\nIn this year of disruption, we also focused on ensuring that our customers continued to have the best experience doing business with us. The investment we made in our digital platforms over the last three years paid off during the pandemic. CEMEX Go was instrumental in allowing our customers and employees to work remotely with seamless efficiency and consistently, safely, and reliably deliver our products despite the challenging circumstances. By year-end, we processed over 61% of our total global sales digitally through CEMEX Go, with a 90% overall usage rate among recurring customers and high levels of customer satisfaction.\n\nOur customers awarded us with a Net Promoter Score of 68 points, an increase of 18 points compared to the prior year, meeting and surpassing our 2030 goal.\n\nTo respond to important market changes in outlook resulting from the pandemic, we launched Operation Resilience. This is our medium-term strategy designed to achieve greater sustained growth and, in turn, to\n\nGiven the growth potential we foresee in this line of business for the coming years, we will continue to invest in Urbanization Solutions.\n\ncreate more value for our stakeholders. Despite the volatility of 2020, we made progress against these medium-term goals, significantly increasing our operating results and margins as well as free cash flow. Our net sales increased 1%, to US$13 billion, and our Operating EBITDA increased by 7%, to US$2.5 billion, both on a like-to-like basis. EBITDA margin expanded 0.9 percentage points to 19%, supported by improved operating performance, cost reduction efforts, and our lowest operating expenses as a percentage of sales in our history.\n\nWe increased our financial flexibility with the successful amendment of our bank debt under our Facilities Agreement. This transaction underscored our commitment to a carbon-neutral economy by incorporating green metrics and is one of the largest sustainability-linked loans in the world and the largest in emerging markets. During the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyear, we continued accessing the capital markets with the issuance of US$2 billion in 7 to 10-year bonds, which, together with the bank debt refinancing, allowed us to improve our debt maturity profile. We also reduced our net debt by US$771 million, which contributed to a decline of 0.30 of a turn in our leverage ratio.\n\nOne of the goals in our Operation Resilience program is to optimize our portfolio by increasing EBITDA through strategic divestments and bolt-on investments while promoting our new key business of Urbanization Solutions, which continued to grow. In 2020, EBITDA from this business grew around 15% and accounted for close to 6% of consolidated EBITDA. Given the growth potential we foresee in this line of business for the coming years, we will continue to invest in Urbanization Solutions.",

In February 2020, we rolled out a proactive Climate Action strategy and announced a 2030 target of reducing our net specific CO2 emissions by 35% compared to our 1990 baseline and a 2050 goal to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete across all our operations. We have confidence in our ability to achieve this, particularly the 2030 objective, where we rely on proven technologies and a detailed plant-byplant roadmap.\n\nAs part of our CO2 emissions reduction strategy, we are accelerating our alternative fuels and clinker factor initiatives while also advancing new carbon mitigation levers such as hydrogen injection. In 2020, we retrofitted all our plants in Europe to utilize this technology, allowing us to achieve higher alternative fuel rate and reduce heat consumption in a significant way. We are moving quickly to extend hydrogen injection to the rest of our operations.\n\n## We have confidence in our ability to achieve our 2030 CO2 reduction target where we rely on proven technologies and a detailed roadmap.\n\nBy launching our new product line called Vertua, the first Net-Zero CO2 Concrete solution in our industry, we made important progress towards our 2050 CO2 neutrality goal. This product offering mitigates its carbon footprint by applying new concrete technologies, thereby allowing customers to fulfill their construction needs using more sustainable products. Vertua has already been used for large infrastructure projects in Europe and has had great acceptance in Mexico, the United States, and South America.\n\nDuring 2020 we strengthened the Social Impact strategy that allows us to reinforce our initiatives to contribute to the well-being of our communities. We have positively impacted more than 23 million people on an accumulated basis, contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly the five in which CEMEX can have the most impact. By focusing on CEMEX's five priority SDGs, we are making large strides in addressing the most pressing global challenges and building a better future.\n\nWe could not have attained this success in our 2020 results and future goals without our outstanding people. We are proud of our workforce and recognize each individual's contribution on a day-to-day basis, especially during this year's challenging and demanding circumstances. We are firmly committed to prioritizing their health and safety and maintaining high levels of employee satisfaction. Efforts such as maintaining a continuous dialogue with employees, imple-\n\nmenting key diversity and inclusion initiatives, and supporting our strong culture of ethics and integrity will help us continue attracting and retaining the talent and skillset that we need to grow.\n\nWe also thank all our partners and suppliers who have worked with us to maintain our supply chain without interruption during these challenging times.\n\nThis year is testimony to the resilience of CEMEX and that we are a company dedicated to building a better future for all our stakeholders. As COVID19 will continue to be a challenge in 2021, we will remain steadfastly focused on the health and safety in all our relationships--our employees and their families, contractors, customers, suppliers, and communities-all the while continuing to provide essential products and services in the markets that we serve.\n\nOn behalf of CEMEX's Board of Directors, our management team, and our employees, we thank you for your continued confidence in CEMEX.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRogelio Zambrano\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nFernando A.

Aligned with the GRI's framework and materiality principles, this analysis helps identify topics to be addressed in our strategic planning and integrated reporting.\n\nTo select the assessment topics, we considered internal and external stakeholder views, carried out an industry-level evaluation, and researched economic, environmental, and major social trends and challenges.\n\nThe identified topics were later prioritized and ranked based on their potential to impact our organization and our stakeholders according to their level of concern reflected on the assessment and the execution of CEMEX management risks and opportunities analysis.\n\n## Our Four-Step Materiality Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentification\n\nof relevant topics to include in the survey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo map the significance these material topics have for our stakeholders, we launched a worldwide materiality survey with the participation of employees, customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, shareholders as well as non-market stakeholders, including community members, NGOs, and industry associations. Together, the 2410 responses received across all regions where CEMEX operates make up the \"stakeholder concern\" axis of our updated matrix.\n\nCEMEX's strategic business functions worked together to carry out a deep-dive exercise that graphed the \"impact on CEMEX\" axis of the matrix.

We quantify these so-called externalities in monetary terms and validate our methodology to estimate the Net Value to Society with the corresponding True Value methodology from KPMG.\n\nThrough this exercise, we enhance our understanding of the materiality, relevance, and interdependency of our company's positive and negative impacts.  We believe that it is an essential step to informed management and decision-making in order to improve the value that CEMEX contributes to our company, our society, and our planet. Furthermore, it allows us to manage risks, be more transparent, and achieve our sustainability ambitions.\n\n## CEMEX Net Value to Society Methodology\n\nThe starting point for our analysis is the retained benefit (EBITDA minus taxes, interests, and dividends; i.e., the part of our value creation that remains within our company).

Aligned with our commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we prioritized five that are directly related to our company's business strategy. SDGs 8, 9, 11, 13, and 15 represent our greatest opportunities for shared value creation and concentrate our largest potential for building a better future.\n\nWe collaborate within and outside our company and have joined forces with sector peers, field experts, authorities, customers, suppliers, NGOs, and other stakeholders to collectively work towards achieving the SDGs. To this end, we devised internal output indicators designed to enhance CEMEX's economic, environmental, and social performance, as well as to track our contributions to our five priority SDGs.\n\nIn partnership with the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), a joint statement is now available to fully comprehend our sector's contribution to all 17 SDGs. We acknowledge that a decade of action is needed to achieve the UN SDGs, and that the concrete industry will play an important role in contributing to achieving these targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Widening Collaboration to Achieve the UN 2030 Agenda\n\nGreater international, regional, and local collaboration and public-private partnerships will be essential to preventing future global health and environmental crises and ensuring business continuity in the long run.\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, during 2020, in Mexico, the private sector led around 17 multi-stakeholder working groups to support and accelerate the SDG targets in the country. This was done in alliance with the federal government and Mexico's Coordinating Business Council (CCE).\n\nOne of the main lessons learned during the pandemic crisis is that we need to increase the knowledge on resilience both within business and society. We acknowledge that through our collaboration and partnerships, we can continue sharing expertise, best practices, creating synergies, and scaling efforts. CEMEX will continue working collectively with multiple stakeholder groups towards achieving the 2030 UN goals.\n\nOur priority SDGs represent our greatest opportunities for shared value creation and concentrate our largest potential for building a better future.\n\n- \u00bb CEMEX is a member of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)\n- \u00bb We continue to lead the UN Global Compact (UNGC) in Mexico for the 2020-2022 period\n\nLearn more about our collaborations with UNDRR and UNGC on pages 67-75 of the Social Impact section of this report \u25b6",

Despite the disruptions of COVID-19 in our operations, higher local-currency prices for all our products along with the growth in cement volumes, more than offset the decline in our ready-mix and aggregates volumes.\n\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained flat for the whole year. Higher costs of purchased cement was offset by lower energy prices.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the year decreased, from 22.6% in 2019 to a record 21.9% due to our cost containment measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating EBITDA increased 3% to US$2.5 billion in 2020. On a like-tolike basis, operating EBITDA increased 7% for the year. EBITDA growth was largely driven by higher prices and savings from our Operation Resilience program.\n\nOperating EBITDA margin increased 0.9 percentage points, from 18.1% in 2019 to 19.0% in 2020.\n\nWe reported a loss on financial instruments of US$16.1 million in 2020, resulting mainly from our USD interest rate swap.\n\nOther expenses, net, for the year were US$1.8 billion in 2020, which includes US$1.5 billion impairment of goodwill and assets taken in the third quarter and severance payments.\n\nWe reported controlling interest net income (loss) of US$1.5 billion in 2020 versus a net income of US$143 million in 2019. The lower net income is the result of the US$1.5 billion impairment of goodwill and assets.\n\nTotal debt plus perpetual notes decreased 5%, or US$609 million, to US$11.1 billion at the end of 2020.\n\n## Global Review of Operations\n\n| Global Operations In millions of US dollars   | Net Sales   | Operating  Earnings  Before Other  Expenses, Net   | Operating  EBITDA   | Total  Assets  4   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Mexico                                        | 2,812       | 783                                                | 931                 | 3,837              |\n| United States                                 | 3,994       | 307                                                | 747                 | 12,442             |\n| Europe, Middle East, Africa  and Asia  1      | 4,453       | 300                                                | 638                 | 6,848              |\n| South, Central America and the  Caribbean  2  | 1,472       | 281                                                | 371                 | 2,384              |\n| Others  3                                     | 239         | (328)                                              | (227)               | 1,914              |\n| Total                                         | 12,970      | 1,343                                              | 2,460               | 27,425             |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Mexico\n\nIn 2020, on a like-to-like basis, our Mexican operations' net sales increased 7% to US$2.8 billion, and operating EBITDA increased 7% to US$931 million versus 2019. During the year, our domestic gray cement volumes increased by 6% while our ready-mix concrete and aggregates volumes decreased by 16%, and 10%, respectively.\n\nThe increase in cement volumes was supported by the self-construction sector, evidenced by the double-digit growth in bagged cement as a result of government social programs, high level of remittances, and home improvements. Activity in the formal sectors experienced a slight recovery in the second half of the year as government restrictions eased and flagship infrastructure projects accelerated.\n\n## United States\n\nOur US operations' net sales increased 6% year over year, to US$4.0 billion, while operating EBITDA increased 19% to US$747 million during the year. This represented our highest reported operating EBITDA since 2007.  Our US operations' domestic gray cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates volumes  increased by 8%, 1% and 4%, respectively, for 2020.\n\nOur cement volumes during the year were relatively unaffected by COVID-19. The residential sector was the main driver of demand as single family starts reached their highest levels since 2016. The infrastructure sector also remained dynamic driven by state/local funding. For the full year, we achieved highest reported EBITDA since 2007 and highest cement volumes since 2016.\n\n## South, Central America and the Caribbean\n\nIn 2020, our net sales for the region declined 8% on a like-to-like basis, to US$1.5 billion. Our operating EBITDA increased 2% on a like-to-like basis to US$372 million. Regional domestic gray cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates volumes decreased by 8%, 34%, and 33%, respectively, for the year. The volume decline is a result of the severe lockdowns experienced in several of our countries, which negatively impacted our performance.\n\nIn Colombia, activity continued supported by the self-construction sector and the execution of 4G highways projects. The decline in our cement volumes reflects our focus on pricing and new capacity in the country. In the Dominican Republic, activity recovered in the second half of the year driven by high level of remittances which contributed to the strong performance of our bagged cement volumes.\n\n## Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n\nDuring 2020, net sales decreased 1% on a like-to-like basis, to US$4.4 billion, while operating EBITDA decreased 1%, to US$630 million. For the full year, our regional domestic gray cement, readymix concrete and aggregates volumes declined 1%, 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nIn Europe, our domestic gray cement volumes remained flat, while our readymix concrete and aggregates volumes decreased by 8% and 6%, respectively. Countries like Germany, Poland and Czech Republic were relatively unaffected from the pandemic. Social restrictions to\n\ndeal with the virus in the UK, Spain, and France, however, impacted demand.\n\nIn the Philippines, our domestic gray cement volumes decreased by 11% for 2020. Our decline in cement volumes during the year was due to lower construction activity, mainly in the public infrastructure sector, as a result of strict lockdown measures implemented by the government.\n\nIn Israel, our ready-mix concrete and aggregates volumes increased by 8% and 12%, respectively, for the year.  Volume growth was driven by continued construction activity in all sectors.\n\n## Trading\n\nOur global trading network is one of the largest in the industry. Our trading operations help us to optimize our worldwide production capacity, deliver excess cement to areas where it is most needed, and explore new markets without the necessity of making immediate capital investments. Our worldwide network of strategically located marine terminals and broad third-party customer base also provide us with the added flexibility to place contracted supplies optimally.\n\nIn 2020, we enjoyed trading relationships in 95 countries. Our traded volume totaled more than 12 million tons of cementitious and non-cementitious materials, including approximately 10 million tons of cement and clinker. Approximately 4.5 million tons of our traded cement and clinker consisted of exports from our operations, while the remaining 5 million tons were purchased from third parties.  We also maintained a sizeable trading position of 0.9 million\n\ntons of granulated blast furnace slag, a non-clinker cementitious material, and 0.6 million tons of other products.\n\nFreight rates, which account for a large share of the total import supply cost, have been subject to significant volatility in recent years. Our trading operations, however, have obtained significant savings by contracting maritime transportation in due time and by using our own and chartered fleet, which transported approximately 50% of our cement and clinker traded volume during 2020. Furthermore, based on our spare fleet capacity, we provide freight service to third parties, generating additional revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Out of the US$160 million of corporate income taxes in 2020 (US$179 million in 2019), US$35 were paid by our operations in Europe (US$34 million in 2019) and US$125 million by our operations in the Americas and other countries (US$145 million in 2019). For purposes of this paragraph, our operations in Europe are mainly comprised of Poland, France, the Czech Republic and Switzerland; our operations in the Americas are mainly comprised of Mexico, the US, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala.\n\nIn addition, for the years-ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an aggregate tax profit of US$368 million and US$262 million, respectively, from our operations in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Israel, the Czech Republic, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Poland.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were allocated free CO2 emission allowances in the countries in which we operate in the European Union (EU) and that are part of the EU Emissions Trading System. For purposes of this paragraph, our operations in Europe are mainly comprised of Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Poland, and the UK. For years 2020 and 2019, we received total European Union Allowances (EUAs) of 8,949,684 and 9,504,497, respectively. The EUAs allocated by country during 2020 and 2019, respectively, were 1,079,391 and 1,102,118 for Croatia; 391,862 and 400,112  for the Czech Republic;\n\n1,205,421 and 1,230,801 for Germany; 3,854,132 and 4,301,659  for Spain; 1,240,879 and 1,267,006 for Poland; and 1,177,999 and 1,202,801 for the UK. The EUAs received were worth US$265 million and US$272 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Breakdown by country of the EUAs for 2020 and 2019, respectively: US$32 million and US$32 million for Croatia; US$12 million and US$11 million for the Czech Republic; US$36 million and US$35 million for Germany; US$114 million and US$123 million for Spain; US$37 million and US$36 million for Poland; and US$35 million and US$34 million for the UK.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, CEMEX has already achieved a close to 35% reduction in CO2 emissions vs. its 1990 baseline across all of CEMEX's cement plants in Europe. CEMEX is the first company in its sector to set industry-leading climate targets for its operations in Europe which align directly to the EU's aspiration of 55% CO2 reduction by 2030. CEMEX has also committed to moving to net-zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050. Since the inception of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2005, CEMEX has taken measures that have resulted in avoiding around 32 million tons of CO2 compared to CEMEX's 1990 baseline level in that region. In order to achieve our 2030 and 2050 CO2 reduction goals, innovative technologies and considerable capital investments have to be deployed. Since EU ETS began in 2005, over US$300 million of investments in Europe are either already executed or planned in the next years to support our CO2 reduction objectives. Additional investments are still required to meet CEMEX's 55% CO2 reduction target by 2030 in Europe. These investments include, but are not limited to, the general process switch from fossil fuels to lower\n\ncarbon alternatives, becoming more efficient in the use of energy, sourcing alternative raw materials that contribute to reducing overall emissions or clinker factor, developing and actively promoting lower carbon products, and the recent deployment of groundbreaking hydrogen technology in all CEMEX's European kilns. CEMEX is also working closely with alliances to develop industrial-scale technologies towards its goal of a net-zero carbon future. Strong and clear regulations such as EU ETS give companies like CEMEX the confidence and certainty to enable these investments, which is exactly what the EU ETS is designed to deliver. For these reasons, as of the date of this report, CEMEX is selling, in one or more transactions, an amount of carbon allowances that is equivalent to approximately 2% of CEMEX's consolidated assets, to contribute to further accelerate CEMEX's climate action strategy and for other general corporate purposes. We believe that after closing these sales, we would retain sufficient allowances to cover the requirements of our operations in Europe until at least 2025.",

We consider this a moral imperative, and it is the reason health and safety is our company's foremost value and priority.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur efforts to offer our employees and contractors a safe and healthy work environment and to provide for our communities' wellbeing directly contribute to our priority SDGs 8, 9 and 11 as well as to SDG 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Over 50 COVID-19 Hygiene and Safety Protocols\n\nIn 2020, we developed 52 hygiene and safety protocols designed to protect our employees and the people that we interact with during our day-to-day business activities from potential risks presented by COVID-19. These detailed guidelines represent new ways for all of us to conduct ourselves at work and in our lives in general.\n\nReleased in April 2020 and translated into all required languages, these documents are based on the best available information from the World Health Organization, health specialists, and our own company health and safety experience. Furthermore, we are constantly updating and reinforcing our protocols to address new developments and to follow applicable health regulations and guidelines.\n\n## Keeping Our People Safe and Healthy During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAt CEMEX, Health and Safety has long been our top priority. The unprecedented challenges of 2020 underscored the importance and relevance of keeping it so. As soon as the COVID-19 threat emerged, we activated our local, regional, and global Rapid Response Teams to implement preventive measures in response to this worldwide health crisis. Throughout the pandemic, CEMEX maintained constant communication with government authorities and maintained the strictest requirements as we worked to safeguard our people and safely deliver to our customers the products and services needed to ensure the continuity of essential activities.\n\nOur production sites as well as construction operations are rigidly controlled environments wellsuited to protect workers and for continuing to carry out essential activities paramount to addressing society's needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to operating under the strictest health and safety protocols, construction sites are normally low-density personnel operations that are closed to the general public and are situated in open outdoor spaces with abundant natural ventilation. Despite these inherent traits that make the building industry low risk for virus transmission, in 2020 we launched special protocols designed to further protect our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities from the risks COVID-19 presents.\n\nAmong the protocols implemented and shared with our customers, commercial partners, and other companies are: Personal Hygiene, Physical Distancing, Screening at the Workplace, CEMEX Truck Drivers, Workplace Cleaning, and Commuting To and From Work, among many others.\n\n## Extending our COVID-19 Protocols to the CEMEX Family\n\nOur 52 COVID-19 protocols also address situations away from our worksite, focusing on critical moments when our employees or their family members could be exposed to the virus, and how to prevent contagion. Throughout the year, we made special efforts to reach employees' families with this information by utilizing digital technologies such as videoconferences and social media.\n\nLearn more about the publicly available COVID-19 Protocols implemented in all of our operations",

By analyzing the unique requirements of each role, we discerned that across all employees we needed to prioritize four essential behaviors to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission: identifying and reporting symptoms, personal hygiene, physical distancing, and protecting yourself and others.\n\nWe branded these four behaviors as the 'Behaviors that Save Lives' and created and deployed a global awareness and adoption campaign to advance them quickly throughout our operations. The full deployment of the global campaign to share the COVID-19 protocols and to embed the Behaviors that Save Lives into daily activities was coordinated in record time, with guidelines, playbooks, as well as other communication and training materials translated and distributed throughout our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The COVID Coordinator Role: Critical to our Efforts\n\nClose to 2,000 of our employees around the world assumed a new COVID Coordinator function, which has been critical to our efforts to continue safeguarding our people and seeking the continuity of our business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The role of the coordinator is to help keep our employees and contractors safe and healthy, and also to monitor and support the adaptation of necessary measures at each facility so as to reduce the risk of contagion.\n\n## Strengthening Communication with our Employees During the Pandemic\n\nDuring the pandemic, we strengthened our communication with our employees to understand more about how COVID-19 is impacting their lives and to keep them continuously informed of the actions and protocols we were undertaking.

We believe that zero injuries and fatalities are possible, and, to that end, we continually renew our determination to protect our people.\n\nWe continued to make progress in most of our countries in 2020, with 96% of our operations achieving zero employee and contractor fatalities and Lost Time Injuries (LTIs). These results provide both motivation and clear evidence that our Zero4Life commitment is producing positive outcomes and becoming a reality across the vast majority of our sites.\n\nOur 0.5 employee LTI frequency rate has remained a positive benchmark for a global company in our industry for several years. Sadly, there were 3 employee and 4 contractor fatalities, 5 of which occurred away from our premises. We are committed to maintaining our positive momentum on this important health and safety journey.\n\n- \u00bb We have continued to reduce the number of fatalities year-over-year but acknowledge zero is the only acceptable number.\n- \u00bb We reduced the total number of injuries involving employees and contractors. Progress in the past decade has derived in 77% LTIs reduction.\n- \u00bb 85% of our operations achieved zero employee and contractor Total Recordable Injuries (TRI's).\n\n## Contractor Safety\n\nConsistent with our Zero4Life commitment, we are not only dedicated to the safety of all of our employees, but also to that of our contractors. Accordingly, we continue to focus on contractor management and driving safety in our various global campaigns and initiatives. Each injury and each fatality are analyzed carefully to identify root causes and required actions to prevent future incidents.\n\nOur Contractor Health and Safety Verification Program is designed to confirm the practices and credentials of contractors who work on our behalf. Working with our Global Procurement team, we evaluate contractors' health and safety practices through a specialized third-party organization that utilizes a data-driven system. The verification checks for regulation compliance, liability policies, risk premiums, manuals and procedures, and applicable training and accreditations, among other requirements. This evaluation helps us to verify that contractors know and comply with health and safety processes and keep safe while working with us.\n\nAs part of our Contractor Health and Safety Verification Program, in 2020, we reached our goal of evaluating at least 82% of our company's procurement contractors spend. To achieve this goal, we engaged our operating countries and worked closely with our Health and Safety Functional Network.\n\n## Protecting Vulnerable Road Users\n\nFrom innovative awareness campaigns and safety features for our trucks, to defensive driving training and workshops, we aim to enhance road safety for drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians, and other vulnerable road users. In 2020, our operations relied on digital platforms to reinforce road safety with key stakeholders, allowing us to bolster strong communication while complying with social distancing measures.\n\nWe also continued with the campaign, introduced in 2019 and launched in 63 cities around the world, that has seen more than 200 CEMEX trucks branded with high-visibility graphics and safety tips to raise road safety awareness aimed at helping protect pedestrians.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Relying on standardized controls and procedures in the countries where we operate helps us build safer operations and consistently monitor the progress of our initiatives.\n\nOur Global Health and Safety Policy is the cornerstone of our CEMEX Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) and sets out clear expectations, for leaders and workforce, to carry out their activities in a safe manner and to care for the well-being of our employees, contractors, and other people with whom we interact. Updated in 2020, the policy now reinforces topics such as communication with suppliers, reporting and incident investigation, as well as taking care of the health and safety of others.\n\n## H&S Management System\n\nThe HSMS, based on the OHSAS 18001 standards, empowers our leaders to implement a successful health and safety strategy for the company and guides us on how to adequately allocate resources to training programs for our employees. In addition to defining operations in accordance with local regulations, the HSMS also lays the groundwork for assessing potential risks and planning the measures needed to mitigate them in a coordinated manner. Our line managers utilize our HSMS on an ongoing basis and make a formal and deep review each year to help them formulate their annual Health and Safety Improvement Plan.\n\nIn 2020, we acted swiftly to add a new dedicated element to our HSMS to effectively manage and mitigate risks and impacts from pandemics and epidemics. This 15 th element in CEMEX HSMS is designed to help us to remain effective in our management of risks associated with the current virus and to institutionalize our approach in the future if further situations of a similar nature occur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## H&S Training: Achieving Our Goals\n\nAt CEMEX, training is a key part of our strategy to achieve our Zero4Life commitment. We continuously revise and seek to improve our training programs and strive for all of our employees to possess the correct knowledge, skills, and experience to perform their jobs safely.\n\nAs part of our training program, executives, line managers, and supervisors must complete our Health and Safety Academy, designed to enhance the leadership skills and to reinforce our number one value and priority across our organization-from our production plants to our corporate offices. The Academy was launched in 2016 with our Foundation Module, which prepares our line managers to lead by example and play a fundamental role in ensuring safety throughout our operations. Launched in 2017, Module 2 enables our line managers to utilize our HSMS tool to help achieve our Zero4Life commitment in their operations. Module 3, deployed in 2018, is designed to enhance the proficiency of our line managers in key topics.\n\nIn 2020 we strengthened our Health and Safety Academy training to address the new Pandemics and Epidemics Element included in our HSMS. We delivered the newly designed training using CEMEX University's self-learning platform to reach over 10,800 line-managers, in nine languages, across all regions worldwide, which represented more than 16,200 hours of training during 2020 on this topic.\n\nLearn more about CEMEX University on page 63 of this report. \u25b6",

To this end, our key proactive efforts include Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) and Near Miss/Hazard Alert Reporting.\n\nThe VFL Program includes a process whereby our leaders regularly engage with frontline workers on health and safety matters to influence non-risk-taking behaviors and to reinforce the importance of keeping themselves and others safe. In 2020, we continued implementing some in-person VFL site visits in adherence with physical distancing measures, and we also transitioned to virtual engagement exercises to reinforce our health and safety culture and maintain high levels of awareness. This approach was designed to convey organization-wide the genuine commitment of every manager to health and safety and to inspire positive behaviors by others during the pandemic.\n\nFor more than 10 years, CEMEX has consistently implemented the Near Miss/Hazard Alert System across all of our geographies and business lines. Employees, contractors, or anyone visiting a CEMEX site can use this tool to report identified risks, thus contributing greatly to the elimination of potential hazards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reinforcing Our Health and Safety Culture with Innovation\n\nFrom self-assessment systems to mobile apps, GPS tracking, and the creative branding of our trucks, we are continuously developing and deploying innovative initiatives to proactively advance our goals.\n\nWe continued to install specific safety features for our company's trucks in an ongoing program to help improve road safety. These features include vehicle sensors, camera systems that alert our drivers to potential dangers, and many other types of safety equipment. Our countries are utilizing truck GPS and telematics data to not only identify risky driving behaviors that require additional training, but also to highlight good driving performance that merits recognition. Data that we track include speed, harsh braking, and driving hours; several appropriate systems have been developed to monitor potential issues and to bring them to the attention of operations and their drivers.\n\nWithin our operations, we also deploy such measures as driving simulators, workshops, and video sessions to improve our drivers' knowledge base on rigorous topics for our organization, such as logistics and transportation. Our Mobile Intelex App gives our people the capability to report near misses, hazards, inspections, and leadership health and safety visits-anytime, anywhere-on their cell phones, tablets, and computers, enabling quicker reactions to prevent injuries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and Safety Awards: Recognizing Those Who Excel\n\nOur Global Health and Safety Awards provide us with the opportunity to recognize those operations and employees that excel at providing a safe workplace and promoting a healthy lifestyle among our employees and everyone involved with our company.

Alternative fuels are predominantly non-recyclable materials and waste from industrial, domestic, agricultural, and forestry processes-including used tires, processed municipal solid waste, and biomass residues such as rice and coffee husks, animal meal, and sewage sludgewhich contain recoverable energy and material.\n\nOur Alternative Fuels Strategy helps us confront climate change by enabling us to rely less on fossil fuels and thereby reduce the CO2 intensity of clinker manufacturing. Concurrently, by co-processing waste as an alternative fuel in our cement operations, we can help decrease the amount of waste society sends to landfill, reduce public investment in new dedicated waste management facilities, and foster local business creation and employment by developing alternative fuel supply chains.\n\nOur 2020 milestones:\n\n- \u00bb 25.3% global alternative fuels rate\n- \u00bb 91% of our cement plants co-processed a cumulative 2.7 million tons of waste as alternative fuels\n- \u00bb ~1.6 million tons of coal replaced\n- \u00bb +US135 million avoided in fossil fuel costs\n- \u00bb +US$43 million in additional savings in carbon-regulated regions where we operate.\n\n## In 2020, our Chelm plant in Poland reached over 93% alternative fuels rate, one of the highest substitution rates in the cement sector\n\nWith 60% substitution of fossil fuels in the region, our cement operations in Europe have the highest share of alternative fuels. This is directly linked to waste directives, and market dynamics that have allowed us to take our largest production cost, fuel, and convert it to an income stream.\n\nOur installations with the highest alternative fuels rate include Chelm and Rudniki in Poland, Prachovice in the Czech Republic, R\u00fcdersdorf in Germany, Morata in Spain, and Rugby in the UK.\n\nCEMEX has the proven experience, technology, and know-how needed to process, store, and leverage the special conditions offered by the rotary kilns in the production of clinker as well as to process waste and recover energy from alternative sources in a responsible manner. Some of the main challenges we face in increasing our global alternative fuel substitution rate are the lack of stable quality fuel supply; limited policy incentives to develop the waste to fuel value chain; and a lack of a regulatory framework that recognizes co-processing as the optimal waste management solution for unrecyclable materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoing forward, we will continue working to reach our targets and seeking investment opportunities to identify and transform new sources of waste to replace fossil fuels, while remaining a prominent industry advocate and leading user of alternative fuels for cement production.\n\nTo learn more about the circular economy benefits of using alternative fuels in clinker production, visit page 54 of this report. \u25b6",

        "page_content": "## Harnessing the Power of Hydrogen Injection\n\nWe have successfully integrated an innovative hydrogen-based technology into all of our cement plants in Europe. This technology enables our kilns to increase their use of alternative fuels by optimizing the combustion process. Hydrogen burns faster and assists the ignition of biomass. To this end, a mixture of both hydrogen and biomass can be used to address some of the alternative fuel's calorific limitations, leading to a reduction of all fossil fuel CO2.\n\nGuided by our 2030 CO2 Reduction Roadmap, we will continue making the investments needed to extend this technology to other regions, starting with deployment throughout Mexico, the U.S., and SCA&C during 2021.\n\n## Increasing the Use of Clinker Substitutes\n\nWe continue our global push to bring technological, operational, and commercial elements to bear on further reducing the clinker-to-cement ratio in cement production or clinker factor. Using supplementary cementitious materials as a substitute for clinker reduces CO2 process emissions and CO2 emissions from energy use related to clinker production. Substitutes include active minerals derived from industrial waste, such as slag from blast furnaces for steel production and fly ash, a by-product of power plant coal combustion, as well as natural materials such as limestone and pozzolan.\n\nIn our Assiut cement plant in Egypt, we successfully activated clays in our kilns through calcination, which aims to solve the challenge of locally available active supplementary cementitious materials for the cement production process. We are also working to develop tailor-made quality enhancer admixtures to improve the reactivity of cement and, thus, increase the rate of supplementary cementitious materials.\n\nAs of 2020, the average clinker factor in our cement products is 77.0%, down from 85.4% in our baseline year 1990. We aim to achieve further reductions in our clinker factor as a key contributor to reach our 2030 goal.\n\n## Increasing the Use of Decarbonated Raw Materials\n\nWe are also investing in the research and development of other decarbonated raw materials to replace limestone in clinker production. These decarbonated raw materials are normally waste from other industries, such as lignite ash, carbide sludge, or lime residues from the beet sugar industry. These already decarbonized raw materials have a great potential to simultaneously reduce both process emissions and fuel emissions, as less heat is demanded to decarbonize the raw meal.\n\nAs of 2020, we achieved an increase in our decarbonated raw materials of close to 15% in the European cement operations, which contributes to position Europe at the forefront of emissions reduction worldwide.\n\n## Development of Novel Clinkers with Lower Energy Demand and Higher Reactivity\n\nIn recent years, we have paid increased attention to the development of clinker produced with lower energy demand and clinker with higher reactivity that allows for a smaller CO2 footprint in cement. We have successfully developed new types of clinker with a 10% to 20% lower CO2 footprint by changing our raw meal composition to reduce the energy intensity of clinker production and leverage a higher clinker reactivity, thereby allowing for a higher content of clinker substitutes in our cement.\n\nThese new types of clinker have been introduced in several markets, mainly in Mexico and Europe, reaching 50% share in our clinker production in the latter region. We will also continue our work to develop and extend across regions novel cements with significantly larger carbon footprint reductions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently, CEMEX is actively participating in close to 30 research projects aimed at contributing to carbon reduction and mitigation including accelerating CCUS implementation on an industrial scale.\n\n## Harnessing the Sun for Cement Production\n\nCEMEX and Synhelion SA announced the joint development of a groundbreaking technology designed to harness solar energy to fully decarbonize the clinker manufacturing process. The radically new approach replaces fossil fuels with solar heat. To achieve the high temperature needed in the kilns, this pioneering process captures 100% of the carbon emissions from the limestone decarbonization and reincorporates them back as feedstock for fuel production. CEMEX and Synhelion plan a pilot installation into an existing CEMEX cement plant by 2022.\n\n## Advancing High Impact Technologies\n\nCEMEX is participating in the Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement 2 (LEILAC 2) project, an initiative funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research program. CEMEX also has active participation in LEILAC 1, working to develop the direct separation and concentration of process carbon emissions from the clinker manufacture, and will continue its contributions to the project by bringing expertise, experience, and key resources.\n\n## Researching Cost-effective Carbon Capture Solutions\n\nCEMEX Ventures signed an agreement with Carbon Clean, a leader in low-cost modular carbon dioxide capture and separation technology. Carbon Clean solutions for the cement industry could provide a significant reduction in both capital cost and equipment size, enabling the wider-scale commercial deployment of carbon capture systems.\n\n## New CCUS feasibility studies in Texas and California\n\nOur U.S. operations were awarded grants from the U.S. Department of Energy to research and develop innovative carbon capture technology.\n\nIn Texas, CEMEX is partnering with Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. to conduct an 18-month study at CEMEX's Balcones cement plant in Texas, and explore the potential CO2 emission reduction from installing new membrane technology in the plant's production process. The membrane will act as a semi-permeable barrier through which CO2 can pass, facilitating carbon capture at a minimal adoption cost.\n\nIn California, CEMEX was awarded a grant to research, engineer and develop a pilot for a breakthrough carbon capture unit. The project, anchored to CEMEX's Victorville, California cement plant, will also contemplate cost-competitive solutions to completely close the loop on current carbon emissions.\n\nThese projects are expected to be an important advancement towards CEMEX's ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The National Technical Center of CEMEX France will evaluate in its laboratory facilities the physical and mechanical properties of the carbonated recycled concrete aggregates when used in ready-mix concrete.\n\n## Leveraging New Aggregates from Plastic\n\nCEMEX Ventures announced an investment in Arqlite SPC, a company focused on producing artificial gravel from unrecyclable plastic waste. By giving plastic a second life, we avoid the use of natural quarry aggregates, thereby saving resources and reducing the carbon footprint of concrete designed for applications such as drainage, precast, and lightweight concrete systems for non-structural use.\n\n## New Concrete Technologies\n\nWe continue working to further develop concrete technologies, admixtures, and novel binding materials that help lower the CO2 footprint compared to conventional cement.\n\n## Improving Other Cementitious Materials\n\nCEMEX signed an agreement with Carbon Upcycling Technologies that aims to produce nanomaterials with greater reactivity and a lower carbon footprint. We expect this venture to result in a doubling of the industrial residues we use to 6 million tons annually by 2030, an increase that will enable a lower carbon footprint in cement and concrete.\n\n## Reforestation and Other Carbon Sink Initiatives\n\nWe strongly support the role that natural carbon sinks can play in reducing the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Our quarries rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation efforts enable CO2 removal and enhance these natural carbon sinks. Similarly, El Carmen, CEMEX's 140,000-hectare biodiversity reserve located on the U.S.-Mexican border, stores around 11 million tons of biologically sequestered CO2, equivalent to 30% of our annual worldwide CO2 emissions. Going forward, we aim to continue the expansion and protection of these natural carbon reservoirs, helping reduce the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nLearn more about El Carmen on page 57 of this report. \u25b6\n\n<!-- image -->",

In some cases, applicable regulations also imply continuous online monitoring of these emissions.\n\nGiven CEMEX's Environmental Excellence purpose, we decided several decades ago to go beyond local air regulations and invest to effectively implement Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) across all of our operations, even when this is not mandatory in all geographies. CEMS for clinker production, together with our internal EMS, provide effective resources for air quality optimization where we operate.\n\nIn addition to our continuous monitoring, in 2020, we invested more than US$5 million in the best available emissions abatement techniques and equipment, including a system implemented in Croatia that substitutes urea with ammonia to reduce NO x emissions.\n\nDue to COVID-19 disruptions during the year, we postponed other purchases and the installation of previously acquired CEMS; consequently it was not feasible to reach our goal of 100% of our clinker produced with CEMS by year-end 2020. Our new goal is to achieve this target by 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CEMEX Air Emissions Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Emissions: Major emissions -dust, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and sulfur compounds (SO x )- are released as part of the cement production process.

In 2020, we consumed more than 12 million tons of waste and non-recyclable by-products, which is over 30 times more waste than we sent to landfill. Moreover, by 2030 we aim to increase by 50% the amount of waste and by-products we capture as alternative fuels and alternative raw materials.\n\nAt CEMEX, we have the know-how to source, process, store, and recover energy from waste responsibly. Cement kilns are ideal for the sustainable and safe disposal of many types of waste and residues that cannot be recycled but can be used as a substitute for fossil-based fuels. Co-processing waste as an alternative fuel in cement kilns is a more efficient waste management solution for society than landfills or incineration.\n\nWe are also seizing the mineral content of waste from other industries as alternative\n\nraw materials. In the cement production process, we replace part of the clinker with by-products from other industries, including fly ash and slag. In the ready-mix concrete production process, we recycle materials to use as cement substitutes and consume waste from construction and demolition sites as alternative aggregates.\n\nThrough these processes, we achieve one of the most important virtuous cycles for our operations: we have become consumers of waste and non-recyclable by-products from several industries, including power, iron, steel, agriculture, and municipal waste management.\n\n## Recycling Waste From Our Operations\n\nWe aim to maximize reusing clinker kiln dust and bypass dust in the production loop, mainly avoiding the need for its disposal in a landfill. When this process is not possible, we make every effort to recover these by-products for other uses. For example, cement kiln bypass dust can be used for soil or road stabilization, fertilizer, or as a de-icing agent for roads in the winter, contributing to a circular economy.\n\nIn 2020, we recovered 94% of our total generated waste and further reused or recycled it within our operations, with only 6% going to landfills.\n\n## Increasing Our Waste Management and Co-processing Capabilities\n\nThis year our Huichapan cement installation in Mexico increased its co-processing capacity by 9% through a US$1.4 million investment that widens waste processing and provides a safe and sustainable solution to industrial waste, mostly consisting of residues impregnated with hydrocarbons that require specialized handling and disposal. The plant is now capable of co-processing up to 2,000 tons of this kind of waste a month.\n\nIn the UK, our Climafuel \u00ae system project seeks to increase our Rugby Plant's Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) consumption by 16%, leading the plant to reach a total of 75% in alternative fuels substitution. The project involves a complete system to safely receive, handle, and feed RDF to the cement kiln. The US$21 million project is currently in execution, with an expected completion date in June 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our goal is to develop by 2030 a specific Water Action Plan (WAP) for each of the mapped locations. As a first step, in 2021, we aim to implement WAPs in 1% of sites located in extremely high waterstressed zones.\n\nThe research was completed in collaboration with the University of Alcal\u00e1 Foundation using Aqueduct, an online tool run by the World Resources Institute that provided valuable information to understand and respond to water quantity, quality, regulatory, and reputational risks worldwide.

The goal is to help restore the ecosystem services to where they were before extraction.\n\nLastly, for any part of the impact area that could not be restored or rehabilitated, compensation is sought with a Biodiversity Action Plan.\n\n## Third-party Certified Conservation Projects\n\nIn 2020, we continued and strengthened our conservation efforts. In addition to implementing BAPs in targeted quarries, we have extended our strategy to other sites that do not overlap high value biodi versity areas. For this purpose, we are working to achieve and multiply third-party certifications from different environmental organizations such as the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), ECOCERT, Texan by Nature, Croatia's Ministry of Environment and Energy, among others.\n\nIn 2020, the WHC awarded CEMEX the Corporate Conservation Leadership Award, the most prestigious recognition presented annually by WHC to honor the corporate commitment to biodiversity, conservation education, and meaningful alignments with global conservation objectives.\n\nOur conservation activities provide a valuable opportunity to engage employees and local communities in wildlife enhancement initiatives and foster awareness of how industry and natural habitats can coexist.\n\n- Learn more about our WHC certified programs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25cf\n\nRestoration / Rehabilitation\n\nCompensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, in 2020 CEMEX and BirdLife defined a new Biodiversity Proximity Study to identify CEMEX's biodiversity-related priorities for the coming years.\n\nThe study will be carried out during the first quarter of 2021 and calculates proximity to high conservation value areas using the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool. This tool results from a partnership between BirdLife International, Conservation International, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre.\n\nThe study will analyze over 400 of our cement and aggregates sites worldwide. The findings of this assessment provide a scientific basis by which to identify CEMEX's biodiversity-related priorities for the coming years for developing a sound biodiversity risk management program and to design activities to support the company's sustainability strategy for 2030.\n\n10 years of partnership with BirdLife International\n\n+25,000\n\nhectares of area positively impacted by conservation projects\n\n+60 BAPs in areas of high conservation value\n\n~100\n\nconservation groups and stakeholders identified and engaged\n\n+100\n\npriority species have benefited from biodiversity action plans\n\n+4,000\n\nstudents engaged in environmental education\n\nWe are advancing toward our goal of implementing local BAPs in every quarry that overlaps with high-value biodiversity areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## El Carmen: Preserving Nature and Sharing its Wonder\n\nOver the past 20 years, CEMEX has been preserving nature and sharing its wonder through El Carmen, a private trans-boundary conservation area in Mexico and the U.S. that comprises five different ecosystems and is home to a myriad species of plants, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n\nIn 2020 we continued our most recent conservation effort: the reintroduction of the American bison into El Carmen Nature Reserve. The American bison is currently on Mexico's list of endangered species and faces several threats to its recovery; most notably the loss of habitat. Over three years, this joint initiative is intended to relocate 60 specimens of genetically pure bison from Rancho El Uno in Chihuahua, Mexico, to El Carmen.

We hear our people's needs and expectations, work to keep them engaged, and enable them to meet their career goals through our aligned organizational structures and processes.\n\n## Talent Management and Development\n\nTo build an enriching experience that attracts, retains, and develops the best talent within and outside of our industry, we seek to offer our employees accelerated opportunities for growth; a transparent, inclusive, and rewarding environment; and experiences that manifest identity and purpose.\n\nWe know firsthand that employees who are supported by their company are inspired to excel. Through our integrated\n\nperformance, talent review, and succession planning processes, we enable career decisions and professional growth. Our digital performance management system allows our employees to seamlessly set, evaluate, and discuss their individual goals with their supervisors while also allowing them to receive feedback on their achievements.\n\nAs our company constantly transforms and expands, our succession management process enables us to build a talented pool of leaders with the skills and deep understanding of our business fundamentals to continue our pursuit of excellence and the successful implementation of our strategy. One of our main objectives is to develop people with the potential to fill key leadership positions; we offer opportunities for them to build experience and capabilities appropriate for success in ever more challenging roles while strengthening our talent pipelines. Through this process, we make every effort to help our employees meet their career development expectations and prepare them for key roles as they challenge themselves with professional development opportunities.\n\nWe know that our employees, when they have the resources they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives, bring their best to the workplace. Our competitive compensation and employee benefit packages are key contributors to delivering a superior workforce experience for all of our people. We continually seek to improve the way we communicate these benefits to our employees-across all organizational levels-so they understand the value and opportunities available to them.\n\n## Leadership Development Programs: Inspiring A Cultural Evolution\n\nInstilling a cultural evolution requires sound, strong direction throughout our company. That's why we invest in leadership development programs at different levels of our organization-always designed with the guiding imperative of diverse representation.\n\nOur three Leadership Development Programs-Ignite, Leader-To-Leader, and Connect-allow us to provide new managers, newly appointed directors, and top-tier executives the foundational knowledge and all the necessary tools to support a successful transition and development in their roles. We underscore the importance of connecting our current leaders as mentors for future leaders; and of creating opportunities to practice their skills while engaged in actual work projects. In 2020 we launched Thrive, a program focused on developing new leadership skills and methodologies for our teams to solve specific business challenges in line with the organization priorities.\n\nIn 2020, more than 340 leaders from across all of our regions and business units participated in these programs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It works in consort with our functional and regional leaders, who act as executive sponsors, to respond to the multi-region, multi-business learning needs of our employees by providing the concepts, practices, tools, and capabilities required to implement our strategy. CEMEX University integrates our institutional academies and our leadership development programs under one comprehensive learning model that favors a blended approach to learning that leverages traditional in-person training and new best-in-class digital learning platforms.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, CEMEX University was an essential tool that helped to quickly adapt our learning offer to the new normal and ensured our employees with continuous, rich learning online experiences during the year.\n\n## Institutional Academies: Building Strategic Capabilities\n\nOur institutional academies are the vehicles through which we develop our company's strategic capabilities. They are designed to work together to advance CEMEX priorities and help shape our people-driven\n\nculture. 2020 marked an impressive year for CEMEX University, with more than 24,000 participants undergoing about 50 different programs across all business units.\n\n- \u00bb Health and Safety Academy: Designed to help assure the well-being of our employees by enabling leaders to understand their responsibility and duties to transmit health and safety practices to their teams.\n- \u00bb Commercial Academy: Teaches sales managers and sales executives how to deliver against CEMEX's commitment to customer centricity and reinforces the key aspects of our Commercial Model, leading to more successful interactions with our customers.\n- \u00bb Culture and Values Academy: Promotes a culture of ethics and compliance into our daily activities by addressing topics such as confidentiality, unconscious bias, workplace harassment, conflict of interest, and fraud prevention.\n- \u00bb Supply Chain Academy: Participants understand how to work together across the functional domains of our supply chain to deliver a superior customer experience.\n- \u00bb Digital Academy: Comprises valuable learning experiences in the realm of emerging technologies that are driving the digital economy, design thinking, and CEMEX's Digital Vision so as to accelerate our growth and deliver value to our customers.\n- \u00bb Cement Operations Academy: Supports our commitment to operational excellence by reinforcing in all plant managers the aspects involved in successfully managing plants and their teams.\n- \u00bb Responsible Business Academy: Teaches our employees the company's shared value strategy for them to be able to propose initiatives that will further increase our positive social impact.\n\n## Our Sustainability Learning Pathway at CEMEX University\n\nConsidering the relevance of spreading the knowledge of the company's strategic priorities among our employees, in 2020 we launched the Sustainability Learning Pathway.

We recognize suppliers for the contributions they make to our business by delivering profitable and innovative solutions and services.\n\nThe overarching goal of our Global Procurement Model is to guarantee the continuity of our operations by achieving the optimal total cost while assuring high quality and terms for products and services. The flexibility and agility of our worldwide model enables us to support our operations' evolving needs and provide economies of scale at country, regional, and global levels by using a strategic sourcing process that leverages the expert management and knowledge of our people throughout our organization.\n\nOur procurement and operations teams continuously challenge our suppliers to further develop their products, services, and businesses for mutual value creation.

Our collaborative efforts helped us successfully optimize inventory levels and quickly respond to fluctuating demand and market restrictions-avoiding overstock or stockouts. They also have enabled more competitive negotiations for some materials and continue implementing our low-cost sourcing initiative.\n\nFollowing global, national, and local health authority recommendations, we developed and implemented strict hygiene safety protocols throughout our operations. These protocols are designed to protect not only our employees, but also extend to our contractors, suppliers, communities, and customers to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our value chain. For instance, our Loading, Dispatch and Reception, Including Warehouses Protocol establishes new requirements for reception and dispatch activities in warehouses to protect our workers and suppliers.\n\nLearn more about our health and safety practices with our contractors and suppliers in the Our Commitment to Health and Safety section on pages 25-29 of this report. \u25b6",

We continually work to engage our suppliers with our core values, including our emphasis on health and safety, excellence, innovation, and integrity.\n\nFor more than a decade, CEMEX Supplier Sustainability Program has contributed to strengthening our value chain's consistency and respect to our sustainability principles, policies, and practices. To this end, we also collaborate in global efforts advancing sustainability in our industry's supply chain, including, since 2010, the UN Global Compact Advisory Group on Supply Chain Sustainability and, more recently, through the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA).\n\nAs part of our Supplier Sustainability Program, our 2030 goal is to assess the sustainability practices of at least 80% of the critical suppliers spend under our company's procurement scope. By critical suppliers, we refer to those business partners who could have a significant impact on our core businesses; in particular, those suppliers who have the highest spend or those that could affect the continuity of our operations, including health, safety, and environmental risks. In 2020, we continued adding new suppliers to the assessment, reaching 63% of the critical group and keeping us on track to achieve our 2030 goal of 80%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo assess our suppliers' sustainability practices, we developed a threephase effort:\n\n- 1. Assessment: In collaboration with a third-party firm, we invite our suppliers to perform a sustainability assessment based on ISO 26000 guidelines, which cover social, environmental, health and safety, business ethics, stakeholder relationships, and financial performance standards.\n- 2. Continuous Improvement: The specialized company we work with analyzes the information provided and prepares a comprehensive report with findings, conclusions, and a proposed action plan to close gaps, if any.\n- 3. Scorecard: The evaluation is periodically updated. The grade is integrated into each supplier's scorecard to track and reward suppliers that demonstrate progress and advanced sustainability practices.\n\n## Suppliers' Code of Ethics and Conduct\n\nOur aim is to always manage our supplier relationships with honesty, respect, and integrity, creating a culture of communication that strengthens our relationship while working to fulfill our company's objectives. Aligned with our principles, policies, and values, we are committed to having our suppliers understand and comply with the CEMEX Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and with the 12 principles of our Code of Conduct When Doing Business with Us-which are rooted in our membership in, and commitment to, the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our CEMEX Code of Conduct When Doing Business with Us\n\n## Contractor Health and Safety Verification\n\nGlobally executed in alliance with specialized firms, CEMEX Contractor Health and Safety Verification Program is designed to certify our contractor's compliance with stringent health and safety standards, proper training and applicable accreditations. We have engaged all countries to successfully accomplish our target of 80% certification of our procurement spend, overpassing this goal in 2020 with an 82% contractors verification rate.\n\nAs one step further on this effort, CEMEX in Mexico recently partnered with Clever, an international firm specialized in Contractor Control, to deploy and implement a document management system to guarantee the compliance of our contractors' employees, machinery and vehicles with applicable health and safety regulations and requirements.  As of December 2020, more than 1,300 contractor companies, around 8,000 of their employees and more than 1,400 of their vehicles used for the services provided within a CEMEX installation in Mexico have been successfully enrolled in the health and safety verification by Clever. This represents more than 80% of the total amount of suppliers in the target and the remaining share will be covered during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "To strengthen our culture of ethics and compliance, we periodically launch new and updated policies. We have worked on updating and enhancing the following policies:\n\n- \u00bb Anti-Corruption - This enhanced policy not only features robust new controls, but also a section governing interaction with government officials. Before interacting with a government official, employees must enter our online Government Interaction platform, evaluate the details of their planned interaction, and undergo a thorough authorization process. This policy came into effect in 2020.\n- \u00bb Corporate Hospitalities to Government Officials - This policy is complementary to the Anti-Corruption Policy and specifically regulates the entertaining, gifts, travel expenses and other courtesies provided to government officials. This policy contains the management procedures, the authorization routes and specific accounting guidelines. This policy came into effect in 2020.\n- \u00bb Global Policy for Third Parties - This policy features a robust due diligence, screening, and control procedures for potential new suppliers and customers. Notably, this policy screens companies for cases of corruption, money laundering, organized crime, and other relevant issues. We launched this policy in 2020.\n- \u00bb Anti-Money Laundering - This policy features robust controls to help detect, report, and prevent suspicious activity that could give rise to the smuggling of illegally obtained funds and money laundering. We launched this policy in 2020.\n- \u00bb Donations, Sponsorships, and Operational Contributions - These related new and updated policies feature rigorous legal, budgetary, and accounting processes governing donations, sponsorships, and operational contributions.\n\nFurthermore, in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados, and Guyana, we conduct thorough screening, monitoring, and due diligence of third parties through an external service provider before onboarding our third parties in our enterprise resource platform (ERP) system. Additionally, we conduct global monitoring activities of all our third parties registered in our ERP system on a periodic basis with information available on public lists to verify if our third parties have been involved in bribery, antitrust, corruption or money laundering violations and to verify if there are any politically exposed persons (PEPs) involved with our third parties. If we find that a third party failed to meet our internal protocols and procedures, CEMEX shall seek to end the relationship with said third party.\n\n## Our Reporting Mechanism - ETHOSline\n\nIf there are concerns or suspected ethics, governance or compliance violations, it's important that our employees, our stakeholders, and the general public have a trusted, secure place to which they can turn. Managed by an autonomous third party, our ETHOSline provides an online portal and phone line for sending comments, requesting advice, and submitting complaints on these topics. Accessible through our company website, this secure, confidential, and independent portal is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Open and free for all to use, our ETHOSline reporting statistics demonstrate the confidence that people have in this tool.\n\nUltimately, our main goal is to get to the bottom of every report; all cases are looked at. We carry out a review; then if needed, an investigation to handle it according to our ETHOS Manual; and if applicable, apply consequences if our Code of Ethics is violated.\n\nOverall, from a total of 620 cases reported through our official reporting channels in 2020, 514 were closed, of which 174 were found to be true and 269 disciplinary actions were taken. From the true cases reported, 66 employees were dismissed as a result of investigations.\n\n## Business Ethics Training and Communication\n\nOur employees are continually informed of CEMEX business ethics principles in multiple ways, including our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, employee onboarding activities, internal communication channels, face-to-face and online courses, legal and accounting audits, relevant global policies, as well as our robust intranet Policy Center. In 2020, we designed and rolled out 412 global communication campaigns in relation to ETHOSline awareness and our ethics framework, enabling us to reach all our employees. These campaigns and actions help to promote our company values, policies, and procedures and to inform our employees about unacceptable behavior such as discrimination, improper treatment, mobbing, theft, rules for gifts and courtesies, and workplace harassment, as well as to reinforce our institutional reporting mechanisms.\n\nDuring 2020, approximately 25,000 employees and 1,400 outside participants received training related to business ethics, human rights, and legal compliance, dedicating more than 37,000 total hours for this purpose.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also impacted our global compliance training program. As a result, we prioritized health and safety trainings. Through CEMEX University, 10,834 employees and third parties from our global operations completed the training course on HSMS Element 15: Management of Pandemics and Epidemics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Environment, Health & Safety\n- \u25cf Misuse, misappropriation of corporate assets\n- \u25cf Business integrity Human Resources, diver-\n- \u25cf sity and workplace respect\n\n14%\n\n8%\n\n26%\n\n52%\n\n<!-- image -->",

With a worldwide focus, led by our ETHOS Group and local ETHOS Committees, the program consists of a set of principles, rules, controls, procedures, guidelines, and bodies designed to comply with the laws and standards of conduct applicable to our company. CEMEX ETHOS Global Program works as an internal network coordinating six core corporate functions with ethics and compliance-related responsibilities:\n\n- 1. Legal - responsible for developing and updating relevant policies; carrying out trainings and legal audits; setting and carrying out proper oversight of third-party management; and managing compliance-related complaints.\n\n## 2. Organization and Human Resources (OHR)\n\n- - responsible for defining and enhancing CEMEX Code of Ethics and Business Conduct; deploying the ethics training program; administering ETHOSline; coordinating and administering local ETHOS Committees; investigating cases within their responsibilities; assuming co-responsibility for CEMEX ETHOS Global Program; promoting a culture of ethics and reporting; and providing end-to-end case management.\n- 3. Internal Control - responsible for implementing controls and compliance with policies; and deploying an internal control model in order to reduce risk exposure and the likelihood of significant and/ or severe deficiencies in the processes and procedures governing our company's operations.\n- 4. Global Service Organization (GSO) - responsible for delivering business services to CEMEX operations, while complying with both our internal and external control requirements and corporate governance model; and performing internal control responsibilities, such as performing SOX testing, following up on remediation plans, advising process owners on items related to internal control, performing change management tests, and promoting compliance with policies.\n- 5. Process Assessment - responsible for overseeing internal audits of controls and compliance with policies; conducting worldwide internal audits; conducting special fraud investigations; performing SOX audit compliance; conducting CAPEX audits; and monitoring risk.\n- 6. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) - responsible for analyzing local and global compliance risks; performing risk oversight, including risk identification, monitoring, assessment, reporting, and mitigation; and following up on risk mitigation measures.\n\nAs part of the Legal function's program responsibilities, special attention is given to the most sensitive countries concerning corruption risks to our business system process. During 2020, our main operations in terms of revenues were: the USA (medium risk), Mexico (high risk), France (medium risk), UK (low risk), Israel (medium risk), Germany (low risk), Philippines (high risk), Colombia (high risk), Spain (medium risk), Dominican Republic (high risk), and Panama (high risk). We also operate in other countries of which some are low risk, medium risk, and high risk. This risk classification is based on Transparency International's 2020 Corruption Perception Index. Our Code of Ethics reflects the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This process emphasizes risk discussions by decision-makers and risk oversight by the Board of Directors.\n\nRisk agendas are developed at a global, regional, country, and business unit level at least twice a year. Risk agendas include all types of risks, trends, emerging concerns, and opportunities that could impact CEMEX in the short (zero to two years), medium (two to five years), and long term (five to ten years).\n\nOther risk management areas and processes within our company complement the surveillance and risk management function: Process Assessment, Internal Control, Legal, Financial Risk Management, ETHOS Compliance, and Sustainability.\n\n## Risk Management Process\n\nOur risk management process is an ongoing systematic approach present in corporate, regions, countries, and operational business units.\n\nOur risk management process is based on international best practices from the Risk Management Society (RIMS) and Business Continuity Institute\n\n(BCI). It is compliant with ISO 31000:2018-Risk management standards and ISO 22300:2018-Business continuity management systems. Furthermore, this process is conducted in compliance with our company's values, laws of the countries where we operate, and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk and opportunity developments are continuously monitored through several channels and a broad variety of report. Changes in risks and opportunities status are promptly communicated to decision makers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiscussion on risk and mitigation strategy at the Executive Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk Identification\n\nCEMEX identifies main risks and opportunities using a combination of a bottom-up and a top-down approach and employing several techniques that include, but are not limited to, risk interviews, online risk surveys, and risk workshops. Focus is on both strategic and operational issues.\n\nWe assess risks and opportunities employing qualitative and quantitative methods to determine their potential impact and likelihood of materialization in a specific timeframe. We prioritize risks and opportunities based on their impact or relevance to CEMEX's strategic objectives.\n\nA mitigation strategy with a specific action plan is defined for each risk, and a risk owner-mainly responsible for the risk treatment-is assigned. ERM representatives follow up on the risk treatment strategy and in some cases, acts as coordinators of ad-hoc task forces focused to mitigate specific risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Main Risks and Mitigation Strategies\n\nThe following is a brief description of some of the main shortterm, medium-term, and long-term risks faced by CEMEX and their corresponding mitigation strategies:\n\n## The COVID-19 Pandemic and / or any Other Outbreak of Disease or Similar Public Threat\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented by some governmental authorities to contain and mitigate the effects of the virus have resulted or may result in a number of consequences, including: temporary restrictions on our production facilities, staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages, and disruptions in our delivery systems; disruptions or delays in our supply chains; reduced availability of land and sea transport; increased cost of materials, products, and services on which our businesses depend; general slowdown in economic activity; and financial markets volatility, among others. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the construction activity and demand for our products have been and may continue to be affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The degree to which COVID-19, or any other outbreak of disease or similar public threat, could affect our results and operations will depend on the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic conditions can resume, among other uncertain events.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Adherence to over 52 protocols to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, their families, our customers, suppliers, and communities\n- \u00bb Business continuity under government guidelines of Safe and Essential industry\n- \u00bb Enhanced customer experience through proven e-commerce platforms and distribution network\n- \u00bb Activation of Rapid Response Teams and implementation of Business Continuity Plans to minimize operational disruptions\n- \u00bb Implementation of Social Impact Strategy: ~1.7 million of beneficiaries as of November 2020.\n- \u00bb Execution of financial strategy to ensure liquidity and financial flexibility\n- \u00bb Implementation of cost savings initiatives and delay of capital expenditures\n\n## Uncertain Economic Conditions\n\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic conditions of the countries where we operate. We face risks particular to each country and region, as well as global economic risks. Some potential sources of economic risk include: slow global growth or economic contraction; changes in the economy that affect demand for our products and services; the cyclical activity of the construction sector; trade barriers, changes in existing trade policies or changes to, or withdrawals from, free trade agreements; protectionist trade policies and escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict or its spread to other parts of the world; changes in financial conditions and its impact on foreign exchange rates, interest rates, access to financing, and financial markets; volatility of oil prices; economic vulnerability of emerging market economies; China's economic performance; political uncertainty and geopolitical risks; and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Implementation of Operation Resilience\n- \u00bb EBITDA growth through margin enhancement\n- \u00bb Optimize our portfolio for growth\n- \u00bb Reduce net leverage\n- \u00bb Delivery of superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies\n- \u00bb Enhancement of revenue streams (Core Businesses, CEMEX Ventures)\n- \u00bb Drive operational excellence\n- \u00bb Implementation of financial strategy\n\n## Political Uncertainty and Social Instability\n\nWe are subject to the political and social environment of the countries where we operate. Any political, geopolitical, or social event that affects a country's economic development, its business environment, or that makes significant changes in laws, public policy, or regulations has the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\n\nNew governments and elections that take place in the countries where we operate, such as the 2020 U.S. presidential and senate elections, in addition to other political and geopolitical events such as Brexit, trade conflicts, social unrest, and political instability in Latin American countries have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the economy, financial markets, social stability, and business environment, which could materially and adversely affect our results and prospects for our business.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Building long-term relationships with key stakeholders (communities, governments)\n- \u00bb Tailor-made strategy per country\n- \u00bb Business continuity plans to minimize operational disruption\n- \u00bb Security protocols to protect our employees\n- \u00bb Monitoring and scenario planning to anticipate potential risks and opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Complex Competitive Dynamics\n\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and are served by numerous industry players. Additionally, new entrants, capacity expansions, and imports have caused and may continue to cause supply-demand imbalances, affecting our prices and sales. Some of these industry players could compete based on a variety of factors, often employing aggressive pricing strategies to gain market share; if we are not able to compete effectively, we may lose substantial market share, and our sales could decline or grow at a slower rate, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Delivery of superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies\n- \u00bb Enhancement of revenue streams (core businesses, CEMEX Ventures)\n- \u00bb EBITDA growth through margin enhancement\n- \u00bb Optimization of our portfolio for growth\n- \u00bb Drive operational excellence\n\n## Climate-Related Risks\n\n## Carbon Regulation Transition Risk\n\nCEMEX is subject to a strict carbon pricing approach in the form of cap-and-trade systems in those geographies with a carbon regulation in place, particularly in Europe and parts of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUSA, as well as to the risk of transition to stricter carbon pricing in other geographies to be regulated in the short and medium-term, both of which may have a potential financial impact on its businesses. Even though CEMEX has taken steps which make it likely that it will achieve compliance with the limits of such cap-andtrade systems, any transition to a stricter carbon pricing in the countries where we have operations may cause CEMEX's non-compliance with the relevant cap-and-trade systems, which may lead to substantial penalties and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Technology\n\nDevelopment of technologies is key to reduce our emissions in the long-run to meet our NetZero CO2 concrete goal and the limits of any cap-and-trade systems to which CEMEX is subject. Failure to, effectively develop and roll-out any necessary technologies, as well as the lack or late implementation of these new technologies could lead CEMEX to fail in achieving its Net-Zero CO2 concrete goal and the limits of any cap-andtrade systems to which CEMEX is subject, which may lead to substantial penalties and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Markets\n\nCEMEX has identified that market development is a key topic in the long term. More stringent building and energy efficiency standards are likely to foster the development of new low carbon products and effective constructive solutions. Therefore, not meeting the future market expectations in the form of new low-carbon products and effective constructive solutions could lead to reduced demand for our products and solutions, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Reputation\n\nCement could be perceived as a relevant contributor to CO2 global emissions, which could\n\naffect our future sales and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Physical risks (acute and chronic)\n\nClimate change patterns and acute physical climate risks, mainly extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones and blizzards, and chronic physical risks like rising sea levels or water stress mapping could cause damage in the most exposed of our operations, as well as the disruption of our business continuity. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions:\n\n- \u00bb CEMEX has set and publicly announced its 2030 reduction target for which it developed a CO2 Roadmap including specific reduction initiatives for each cement site and identifying the resources (CAPEX) and calendar for their implementation. Both the target and roadmap have been verified by Carbon Trust, ensuring technical feasibility of the considered technologies as well as adequate governance and a robust strategy to reduce emissions. Each region monitors on a monthly basis its site-by-site plan to ensure its implementation and resources allocation\n- \u00bb CEMEX R&D is continuously enhancing our solutions portfolio based on the increasing demand of more sustainable products. A recent example is Vertua\u00ae, a family of products that started with a range of concrete with low or neutral CO2 footprint launched in several markets in 2020 and to be extended to other geographies in 2021\n- \u00bb As the development of emerging technologies is key to meet our 2050 carbon neutrality ambition for concrete, the role that CEMEX plays on different research consortiums and partnerships, together with the outcomes of new-technologies mapping, are being monitored in a monthly basis by the CEMEX CO2 Taskforce. This taskforce is a multidisciplinary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngroup with the participation of Sustainability, Operations and Technology, R&D, Energy, Supply Chain and CEMEX Ventures\n\n- \u00bb CEMEX's fourth core business, Urbanization Solutions, also plays a key role in climate-related risks mitigation, by generating sustainable alternatives for metropolises growth, providing the market with high-efficient building solutions, and promoting circular economy through enhanced waste management schemes for cities\n- \u00bb To mitigate reputational risk, CEMEX is actively involved in industry associations including the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) from which concrete is promoted as a suitable building material to cope with climate change. Concrete plays a critical role in making cities sustainable and resilient, as it is the most durable and disaster-resistant among all construction materials\n- \u00bb To mitigate acute physical risks, CEMEX implemented a Business Continuity Program (BCP) for each of its sites in order to minimize the potential impact of a disruptive event in our operations. This program integrates guidelines for emergency support, crisis management, and business recovery. The definition of the CEMEX BCPs ensures business resilience and operation recovery in the case of force-majeure events, ensuring the fulfillment of our commitments with our clients and a quick return to business as usual\n- \u00bb To mitigate impact of the water stress risk we executed a detailed assessment in all our sites to identify potential water scarcity using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tools. Based on the resulting map we have set a 2030 target to implement a Water Action Plan (WAP) in all those priority sites where highrisk water stress was identified. Additionally, we developed water stress scenarios mapping for 2030 and 2040.\n\nFor further information on climate-related risks and opportunities, please refer to CDP report, section C2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we are unable to generate enough cash to service our indebtedness or to secure refinancing on favorable terms-or at all-we may not be able to comply with our upcoming payment obligations. Additionally, our main financial agreements require us to comply with several restrictions and covenants. Any failure to comply with such obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nDevaluation or depreciation of any of the currencies of the countries in which we operate and from which we obtain our revenues, compared to the U.S. Dollar could materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations. In addition, our consolidated reported results and outstanding indebtedness are significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the Mexican Peso and other currencies.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Amendment and refinancing of debt commitments to ensure financial flexibility\n- \u00bb Reinforcement of liquidity\n- \u00bb Issue of debt and raising of capital\n- \u00bb Liability management\n- \u00bb Foreign exchange and interest rate hedging strategy\n\n## Regulatory and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries where we operate. Any non-compliance with or changes in such laws and regulations and/or their interpretation by the relevant authorities and/or any significant delay in assessing the impact and/or adapting to such changes may result in potential costs, fines, and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some of these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to areas such as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, information security, mining, environmental, transportation, taxes, and labor, among others.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Compliance with laws and regulations\n- \u00bb Continuous enhancement of CEMEX's Compliance program: New and updated policies and continued training\n- \u00bb Enhancement of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which addresses anti-bribery, related-person transactions, health and safety, environmental responsibility, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, financial controls, and preservation of assets\n- \u00bb Acknowledgment and understanding of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct by employees\n- \u00bb Increased internal controls through continuous internal audits and internal controls in place to prevent misconduct by our employees and third parties\n- \u00bb Incorporate compliance-related initiatives in the management of third parties\n- \u00bb Monitoring of new potential regulations\n\n## Energy Price Volatility Including Alternative Fuels\n\nElectric energy and fuel costs represent an important part of our overall cost structure. The price and availability of electric power and fuels are generally subject to market volatility and, therefore, may impact our costs and operating results. Furthermore, if thirdparty suppliers fail to provide us the required amounts of energy or fuel under existing agreements, we may need to acquire energy or fuel at an increased cost from other suppliers. In addition, governments in several of the countries in which we operate are working to reduce energy subsidies, introduce clean energy obligations, or impose new excise taxes, which could increase energy costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. Additionally, if our efforts to increase our use of alternative fuels are unsuccessful, due to their limited availability, price volatility or otherwise, we would be required to use traditional fuels, which may increase our energy and fuel costs.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Increase use of alternative fuels\n- \u00bb Secure long-term renewable contracts for energy and fuel supply that not only provide clean energy, but also certainty in future energy costs\n- \u00bb Develop processes and products to reduce heat consumption in our kilns\n- \u00bb Execute hedging for coal and diesel in the financial markets to reduce volatility\n- \u00bb Monitor new regulations, subsidies, obligations, and taxes",

        "page_content": "## Lower Availability or Increased Cost of Raw Materials\n\nWe increasingly use in most of our business certain by-products of industrial processes produced by third parties, such as pet coke, fly ash, slag, and synthetic gypsum, among others, as well as natural resources such as aggregates and water. While we are not dependent on any particular supplier and we seek to secure the supply of the required materials, products, or resources through long-term renewable contracts and framework agreements, short-term contracts are entered into in certain countries where we operate. Should existing suppliers cease operations or reduce or eliminate the production of these by-products, or should any suppliers for any reason not be able to deliver to us the contractual quantities, or should laws and/or regulations in any region or country limit access to these materials, sourcing costs for these could increase significantly or require us to find alternative sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, scarcity and quality of natural resources (such as water and aggregates reserves) in some countries could also have a material adverse effect.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Secure the supply of the required materials through long-term renewable contracts and framework agreements\n- \u00bb Monitor global aggregates, limestone, and natural resources reserves, identify critical levels, and secure reserves in attractive markets\n- \u00bb Monitor permit processes and regulations\n\n## Cyberthreats and Information Technology Risks\n\nWe increasingly rely on a variety of information technology and cloud services, on a fully digital customer integration platform, such as CEMEX Go, and on automated operating systems to manage and support our operations, as well as to offer our products to our customers. Our systems and technologies, as well as those provided by our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to damage, disruption, or intrusion caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as physical or electronic break-ins, catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, security breaches, computer viruses, and cyber-attacks. Any significant disruption to our systems, information leakages or theft of information, or any unlawful processing of personal data, could affect our compliance with data privacy laws and make us subject to regulatory action and could damage our relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Enforce Information Security Policy and risk prevention culture\n- \u00bb Have cybersecurity controls and monitoring services in place\n- \u00bb Have recovery plans and rapid response teams in place\n- \u00bb Enhanced insurance coverage\n- \u00bb ISO 27001 certification on production plants for information security management to preserve confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data\n- \u00bb Renewal, modifications, or upgrades of required systems and technologies\n\n## Health and Safety Risks\n\nActivities in our business can be hazardous and can cause injury, illness, or fatality to our people, or else damage to property. Accidents that occur at our facilities could result in adverse outcomes to employees, disruptions to our business, and may have health, legal, and regulatory consequences. We also may be required to assume costs and liabilities to compensate affected personnel or repair or replace damaged property. This could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, employees are subject to contracting existing or new viruses that could affect their health and the health of others, which could cause disruptions in our operations and impact our results.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Ensure nothing comes before the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and the community where we operate\n- \u00bb Implementation of Health and Safety Protocols in all our operations\n- \u00bb Full adherence to high health and safety standards\n- \u00bb Continued monitoring, preparedness, and compliance to health and safety recommendations\n\n<!-- image -->",

Talent attraction could be impacted as the technical skills needed for the job are highly sought in the market and as the construction industry could be perceived as less attractive than other industries, especially for new generations. Labor activism and unrest, or failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations, are also a concern. This has the potential to impact our ability to execute our business plan and strategy efficiently.\n\nIn addition, labor shortages in the construction industry have the potential to impact the overall construction activity which could materially and adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Evolution of CEMEX's culture, policies, and procedures to adjust to the new work environment\n- \u00bb Engagement and development programs to improve talent retention and attraction\n- \u00bb Efforts to increase the talent pools for key positions\n- \u00bb Engagement survey\n\n## Operational Disruption Due to Different Interests from Stakeholders\n\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain good long-term relationships with the communities and governments in the geographies where we operate, there can be no assurance that the mentioned stakeholders could have different, or at times conflicting, interests or objectives from ours. This could result in delays in legal or administrative proceedings, unrest, negative media coverage, as well as in requests for the government to revoke or deny our concessions, licenses, or other permits. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Compliance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations\n- \u00bb Social impact strategy and adherence to high social responsibility standards\n- \u00bb Implementation of sustainable community engagement plans to build mutually beneficial long-term relations with key stakeholders\n- \u00bb Business continuity plans to minimize business disruption\n\n## Adverse Weather and Natural Disasters\n\nConstruction activity, and thus the demand for our products, decreases substantially during periods of cold weather, when it snows, when heavy or sustained rainfalls occur, or generally, during winter or rainy and snowy seasons. Any of these events can adversely affect our operations, as well as our access to products and materials. Additionally, some of our operations are particularly exposed to hurricanes, blizzards and similar weather events. The decrease in sales volumes is usually counterbalanced by the increase in the demand for our products during the reconstruction phase, unless any of our operating units or facilities are impacted by the natural disaster. Such adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations if they occur with unusual intensity, or last longer than usual.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Have business continuity plans to avoid major disruptions to our business\n- \u00bb Insure assets - Some of our main operations and assets are insured against such events. However, in most cases, the insurance policy does not cover the total impact that an adverse event could have, which limits its effect\n- \u00bb Provide construction solutions for reconstruction phases\n\n## Potential Disruption by Emerging Technologies or Innovations\n\nIn recent years, technology has started to transform the construction industry. Emerging disruptions, including but not limited to digitalization, automatization, new materials, new construction methods, or any other innovation in the construction industry value chain, are likely to accelerate in the coming years to tackle the construction industry's main challenges. These trends have the capacity to disrupt the construction ecosystem value chain and potentially affect our capacity to compete.\n\nConstruction industry transformation will create both risks and opportunities. Digitalization is improving industry productivity and data analytics, and it is transforming our interaction with customers, providers, and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. The introduction of new digital technologies opens access to new industry participants to our markets, which could impact our sales. The use of new materials or construction methods and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services. All of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n\n## CEMEX Mitigation Actions\n\n- \u00bb Deliver a superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies (e.g., CEMEX Go)\n- \u00bb Early detection, development, and commercialization of disruptive and revolutionary construction projects through CEMEX Ventures\n- \u00bb Identification of high growth and sustainable business opportunities through Urbanization Solutions strategy\n- \u00bb Enforced promotion of innovation\n- \u00bb Continued partnership with innovative and sustainable companies\n- \u00bb Continuous Research and Development efforts on products, materials, and technologies\n- \u00bb Enhancement of CEMEX's Digital strategy",

Therefore, at CEMEX we must be vigilant and address this new context effectively in order to align our strategy and operations with universal principles of human rights. We understand that these principles constitute a global standard of expected corporate conduct applicable to all of our operations.\n\nAccordingly, we are determined to meet our responsibility to respect all human rights and to foster respect for them among our business partners.\n\nAs a signatory and active participant in the UN Global Compact, we reaffirm our support of its 10 principles on Human Rights, Labor, Environment, and Anti-Corruption. To demonstrate our strong commitment to these principles, we annually submit an Advanced Communication of Progress to the UN Global Compact.\n\nAs part of the mitigation actions proposed as follow-up to our Human Rights Compliance Assessment, we recently updated our employee and supplier Codes of Conduct, and, through them, we continue to build awareness on human rights. We aim to always ensure humane treatment in our installations and together with CEMEX's Global Workplace Diversity and Inclusion Policy, we strive to prevent discrimination due to sensitive medical conditions, social background, family status , or membership in trade unions.\n\nHuman rights are the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment to which all people are entitled. Respecting human rights is reinforced in our core value of 'Acting with Integrity,' which is embedded in the way we do business.\n\nAs part of the campaigns around the enhancement of our Code of Ethics we encourage employees to speak up - without fear of retribution - about any concerns they may have concerning ethics and human rights. We aim to strengthen the credibility of our grievance channels and continually evaluate and review how best to improve our approach to address human rights. We also continue communications on our Human Rights Policy.\n\nOur Human Rights Policy reflects our support and respect for the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights principles, as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In addition, it recognizes employees, communities, contractors, and suppliers as main areas of impact and reaffirms our commitment to the promotion of and respect for human rights throughout our worldwide operations, local communities, and supply chain.\n\nAs part of CEMEX's shared responsibility to climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as our continued determination to respect and support internationally recognized human rights standards, we are fully committed to carrying out our business activities in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner and to minimizing the environmental implications of our activities. This commitment is embodied in our Environmental, Water, and Biodiversity policies.\n\n## Human Rights Commitment Timeline\n\n| CEMEX becomes a signatory to the UN  Global Compact.                                                  |   2004 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| CEMEX approaches Shift for expert  advice on the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights. |   2014 |\n| CEMEX releases its first Human Rights  Policy Statement.                                              |   2014 |\n| CEMEX executes a Human Rights  Compliance Assessment in 30  countries to identify risks to people.    |   2017 |\n| CEO signs enhanced Human Rights  Policy.                                                              |   2018 |\n| CEMEX releases global Workplace  Diversity and Inclusion Policy.

Human Rights continue to be included in both our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Suppliers Code of Conduct.\n\nPolicies that govern our day-to-day operations enable us to implement and safeguard our Human Rights commitments, including our Health and Safety Policy, Stakeholder Engagement Policy, Environmental Policy, Water Policy, and Biodiversity Policy, among others.\n\nWe expect our employees, suppliers, contractors, and other business partners to consistently apply all of our policies and procedures wherever we operate.\n\nConsistent with our commitment to build a truly diverse CEMEX team, and in conjunction with existing and future programs and initiatives, our global Workplace Diversity and Inclusion Policy supports our continuous, constantly evolving journey to create a more inclusive, diverse workplace.\n\nThis policy is accompanied by a number of global guidelines that acknowledge and encourage diversity and inclusion in all of CEMEX's operating business units and corporate offices. For example, the Dynamic Work Schemes Global Guideline is designed to be an agile, attitudinal approach to meeting employees' wide-ranging needs while having a positive impact on productivity, engagement, and retention. As well as the Digital Citizenship Guideline, especially important during the pandemic, since it promotes the effective and efficient use of working and collaboration hours and recognizes employees' right to disconnect by promoting behaviors that allow being off-the-grid outside working hours.\n\n| Existing CEMEX Global Policy                                            | Human Rights Components                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Health and Safety Policy                                                | \u00bb Provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and contractors.  \u00bb Comply with company policies, Health and Safety Management System, procedures, and all applicable local laws. \u00bb Develop a positive health and safety culture whereby individuals look after the health and safety of each other and share our belief that the achievement  of ZERO injuries is possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Human Rights Policy                                                     | \u00bb We seek to align our strategy and operations with universal principles on human rights.

It is integrated into our company's regularly running formal processes, including:\n\n- \u00bb Enterprise Risk Management (ERM): This dedicated corporate function permanently executes a process of risk detection and analysis at global, regional, and local levels by enabling the deployment of corresponding monitoring, mitigation, and reporting measures in a timely manner.  As part of this process, a Global Risk Agenda is biannually presented to the Risk Management Committee, comprised of CEMEX Executive Committee. Additionally, key material risks are evaluated and tracked by the Board-level Corporate Practices and Finance Committee. Other risk management processes within CEMEX, including internal controls and audits, complement the ERM function.\n- \u00bb Global Compliance Program (GCP): Legal compliance audits focused mostly on antitrust, anti-bribery, and insider trading issues are conducted throughout the year in all of the geographies where we operate, especially in the most sensitive countries relative to transparency and risks.\n- \u00bb Suppliers Assessment: We partner with specialized independent firms to perform sustainability assessments of our suppliers across the globe. As part of their scope, these assessments include respect and promotion of human rights in their workforce and supply chain.\n- \u00bb Contractors Assessment: This program is designed to certify that those contractors with which we engage are equally committed to respect human rights aligned with the health and safety of their employees, clients, and the communities in which they operate. To support CEMEX in this important program, we rely on leading global technology and applications development firms.\n- \u00bb Grievance Mechanism: In addition to the above processes, our global grievance mechanisms enable us to maintain permanent communication with our key stakeholder groups, especially those that might be vulnerable under certain circumstances.  Moreover, these open communication channels enable us to obtain valuable feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented mitigation actions based on identified risks to people. Our main grievance mechanisms include:\n- a. ETHOSline: We look to live our values and to properly manage our Code of Ethics.  Therefore, we encourage our employees, stakeholders, and the general public to submit suggestions, inquiries, and possible violations through our ETHOSline communication channel available 24/7.  This reporting mechanism helps us to identify human rights related risks not only in our operations, but also in the communities where we work.\n- b. Global and Local Ethics Committees: Composed of representatives from different functions in each of the countries in which we operate, these dedicated taskforces encourage awareness and enforcement of our Code of Ethics.  All of them receive, investigate, and collaborate to resolve reported ethics breaches, including those related to human rights.\n- c. Stakeholder Dialogues: Aimed at getting to know and understand our stakeholders' needs and concerns, these dialogues enable us to identify potential impacts on people and properly address these risks.\n- d. Local Corporate Social Responsibility Committees: Composed of our plant's director and local environmental officials, trade union representatives, local mayors of nearby towns, neighborhood representatives, and other local institutions, these groups aim to build positive, sustainable relationships with our neighboring communities.",

In 2020, the number of ADSs outstanding, stated in millions of ADSs, represents: (i) the total average amount of ADS equivalent units outstanding of each year and (ii) excludes the total number of ADS equivalents issued by CEMEX and owned by its subsidiaries. From 2016 through 2019 the number of ADSs outstanding also include the total number of ADS equivalents issued in underlying derivative transactions.\n- 7.  For purposes of the selected financial information for the periods ended December 31, 2016 through 2020, the controlling interest basic earnings per ADS amounts were determined by considering the average number of ADS equivalent units outstanding during each year. These numbers of ADSs outstanding were not restated retrospectively neither to give effect to stock dividends occurring during the period nor to present the controlling earnings -per-ADS of continuing and discontinuing operations.\n- 8.  Dividends declared at each year's annual stockholders' meeting for each period are reflected as dividends for the preceding year. We did not declare dividends for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2019, a cash dividend of $150 million was declared for fiscal year 2018. At our annual 2016 shareholders' meeting held on 2017, CEMEX's stockholders approved a capitalization of retained earnings. New CPOs issued pursuant to the capitalization were allocated to shareholders on a pro rata basis. As a result, shares equivalent to approximately 562 million CPOs were issued and paid in 2017. CPO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- holders received one new CPO for each 25 CPOs held, and ADS holders received one new ADS for each 25 ADSs held. There was no cash distribution and no entitlement to fractional shares. In our annual shareholders' meetings held on 2018 through 2020 there was no capitalization of retained earnings. (See note 21.1 to the 2020 Annual Report's Financial Statements).\n- 9.  Please refer to page 194 for the definition of terms.\n- 10. In 2020 excludes the white cement assets held for sale in Spain and certain assets in France. In 2019 excludes assets held for sale in the United Kingdom, Kosmos' assets in the United States and the white cement assets in Spain. In 2018 excludes the assets held for sale in the central region of France and the white cement assets in Spain.

In 2016 excludes the assets held for sale of Fairborn cement plant and the Concrete Pipe Division in the United States, the ready-mix pumping equipment in Mexico and the assets of Andorra plant in Spain. (See note 13.1 to the 2020 Annual Report's Financial Statements).\n- 11.  From 2017 through 2020, other financial obligations include: a) lease contracts as per IFRS 16; b) liabilities secured with accounts receivable; c) the liability components associated with CEMEX's financial instruments convertible into CEMEX's CPOs. In 2016, other financial obligations included capital leases according to former IAS 17. (See notes 3.6, 15.2 and 17.2 to the 2020 Annual Report's Financial Statements).\n- (i)  Beginning in 2019, CEMEX changed its presentation currency from the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and adopted IFRS 16, both with retrospective effects for 2017 and 2018. (See note 3.1 to the 2020 Annual Report's Financial Statements). The amounts for 2016 were translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date for the balance sheet and the exchange rates at the end of each month for the income statement and do not include IFRS 16 effects.",

These financial statements will be submitted for authorization to the Annual General Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of the Parent Company on March 25, 2021.\n\n## 2) RELEVANT EVENT DURING THE PERIOD AND AS OF THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel spread of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that produces the disease called COVID-19 as a pandemic (the 'COVID-19 Pandemic'). At different points in time since the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic, according to and in compliance with the containment measures enacted and implemented by local governments, certain of CEMEX's cement, ready-mix concrete and aggregates operating facilities in different parts of the world have operated with reduced volumes and, in some cases, have temporarily halted operations considering the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. This situation has had the following implications for the Company's business units: (i) temporary restrictions on, or suspended access to, or shutdown, or suspension or the halt of, its manufacturing facilities, personnel shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in the delivery systems; (ii) disruptions or delays in the supply chains, including shortages of materials, products and services on which the Company and its businesses depend; (iii) reduced availability of land and sea transport, including labor shortages, logistics constraints and increased border controls or closures; (iv) increased cost of materials, products and services on which the Company and its businesses depend; (v) reduced investor confidence and consumer spending in the countries where the Company operates; as well as (vi) a general slowdown in economic activity, including construction, and a decrease in demand for the Company's products and services and industry demand generally.\n\nFrom the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic and attending official dispositions, CEMEX has implemented strict hygiene, sanitary and security measures guidelines in all its operations and modified its manufacturing, selling and distributions processes to implement physical distancing, aiming to protect the health and safety of its employees and their families, customers and communities. CEMEX's operations have been affected to different degrees. In this respect, for the year 2020, since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, CEMEX has identified incremental costs and expenses associated with implementing and maintaining the measures of $48 (note 7).\n\nCEMEX's most important segments are, or have been, affected as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 In Mexico, in accordance with technical guidelines set by the government, CEMEX had initially announced on April 6, 2020, that the Company would temporarily halt all production and certain related activities in Mexico until April 30, 2020. Moreover, on April 7, 2020, CEMEX announced that the Company was permitted to resume production and related activities in Mexico to support the development of sectors designated as essential by the government during the COVID-19 Pandemic. In addition, beginning on May 14, 2020 the reopening of social, educational and economic activities were allowed, therefore, companies dedicated to construction and mining industry activities were able to resume full operations as long they complied with the applicable health and safety protocols and guidelines established by the government, as these were considered, and continued to be considered, essential activities during the current COVID-19 Pandemic health emergency in Mexico. No additional official decrees have been issued requiring the construction industry in Mexico to halt all or part of its operations.\n- \u00b7 In the United States, except for a few ready-mix concrete plants in the San Francisco area that were temporarily shut down, all sites that were operational before the COVID-19 Pandemic are active. During November and December of 2020, certain States in the United States continued to implement certain degrees of lockdowns, which may have an impact on our operations and demand for our products and services.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In CEMEX's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia ('EMEAA') region, the main effects have been experienced in Spain, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates, where operations either operated on a limited basis or were temporarily halted. However, CEMEX's operations in the EMEAA region in general have not been halted. Other countries have experienced negative effects on the market side, with drops in demand resulting in some temporary site closures. During November and December of 2020, certain countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom continued to implement certain degrees of lockdowns, which may have an impact on our operations and demand for our products and services.\n- \u00b7 In most of CEMEX's South America, Central America and Caribbean region, considering governmental requirements, the Company's operations were temporarily affected. In Colombia, CEMEX temporarily halted production and related activities beginning on March 25, 2020, partially resuming from April 13 to April 27, 2020 to attend certain allowed needs. Beginning on April 27, 2020 the supply of material and supplies for infrastructure works, public works and general construction was permitted. In Panama, the closing of the Company's operations was initially effective from March 25, 2020 through May 24, 2020, partially resuming for certain approved activities and finally, on September 4, 2020, the supply for construction works in general was allowed. In Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados operations were temporarily halted from the last week of March until May 14, 2020.\n\nThe implications negatively affected CEMEX's financial situation and results of operations, mostly during the second quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated revenues decreased by 1.2% against the previous year, caused by several factors such as the decrease in sales volumes from reduced operations, as well as by the devaluation of several currencies during the period against the U.S. dollar and the intensification of competitive dynamics in some countries, among others. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by a reduction in cost of sales and operating costs and expenses, which decreased 0.4% and 4.6%, respectively, during the same period, because of reduced operations but also considering the strict control of expenditures. During 2020, the Company's Operating EBITDA (operating earnings before other expenses, net, plus depreciation and amortization expenses) increased by 0.3% compared to the previous year (note 3.1). In addition, considering the negative effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its impact on the valuation of the Company's assets as well as the future operating plans for certain assets, in the year ended December 31, 2020, CEMEX recognized non-cash impairment losses of certain fixed assets, related operating permits and goodwill for an aggregate amount of $1,520 (notes 7, 15.1 and 16.2).\n\nA recent World Economic Outlook report published by the International Monetary Fund, states that the COVID-19 Pandemic and its effects on supply chains, global trade, mobility of persons, business continuity, lower demand for goods and services and oil prices, have significantly increased the risk of a deep global recession and projects the global economy to contract sharply. Even though some governments and central banks have implemented monetary and fiscal policies to curb the potential adverse effects on economies and financial markets, these measures may vary by country and may not be enough to deter material adverse economic and financial effects. Even if the most severe restrictive measures have been lifted, the Company considers nonetheless that the construction activity across most of the markets in which it operates will continue to be adversely affected during some time, before returning to pre-COVID-19 Pandemic levels. The degree to which the COVID-19 Pandemic continues to affect the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, some of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and to how fast and to which extent the economic and operational conditions can return, within a new normality with limited activities, until medicines, vaccines and other treatments against the virus are authorized, produced, distributed and accessible to the general public in the countries in which the Company operates, and also to a degree, how much of the world's population is willing to receive the vaccines.\n\nThe Company considers that, if the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic is extended and/or its negative impacts return or are extended, as applicable, there could be significant negative effects or significant negative effects could be repeated in the future, mainly in connection with: (i) increases in estimated credit losses on trade accounts receivable (note 10); (ii) impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill (notes 16.2); (iii) foreign exchange losses related to CEMEX's obligations denominated in foreign currency; (iv) new disruptions in the supply chains; and (v) liquidity risks to meet the Company's short-term operational and financial obligations. The most relevant aspects regarding the potential negative effects mentioned above as of the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 are disclosed in the explanatory notes.\n\nCEMEX dealt with liquidity risks during the deepest phase of suspension of activities within the COVID-19 Pandemic, maintaining sufficient cash, to the extent possible, by means of obtaining financing in the bonds market and with commercial banks. From March through September 2020, CEMEX issued notes, negotiated new loans and borrowed from its committed lines of credit a total of $3,478, of which, as of December 31, 2020 an aggregate of $2,785 had been repaid. In addition, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. suspended its share repurchase program and did not pay dividends during 2020. The Company projects it will continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, which would enable the Company to meet its current obligations. Moreover, as of December 31, 2020, CEMEX has $1,121 available on its committed revolving line of credit (note 17.1).",

        "page_content": "In other measures, beginning on April 8, 2020 and for the rest of 2020: a) all capital expenditures not associated with the management of the COVID-19 Pandemic were suspended; b) operating expenses were incurred strictly according to the Company's markets evolution and demand; c) the Company produced, to the extent permitted by quarantine measures, only the volume of products that markets demanded; and d) all corporate and global network activities not related to managing the COVID-19 crisis and basic operations were suspended. Moreover, to support the Company's liquidity, CEMEX took the following temporary measures; starting May 1st, 2020 and for a 90-day period and subject to all applicable laws and regulations, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.'s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and the members of our Executive Committee agreed to forgo 25% of their salaries; the members of the Board of Directors of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. agreed to forgo 25% of their remuneration (including with respect to the meetings that took place in April 2020); certain senior executives accepted to voluntarily forgo 15% of their monthly salaries during May, June and July 2020; and CEMEX asked other salaried employees to voluntarily defer 10% of their monthly salary during the same three-month period, with the deferred amount scheduled to be paid in full during December 2020. For hourly employees, where applicable, CEMEX worked to mitigate the effects on jobs derived from any operational shutdowns due to demand contraction or government measures derived from the COVID-19 Pandemic and economic crisis. During November 2020, all amounts forgone and/ or deferred were fully reimbursed to all employees, executives and members of the Board of Directors of the Parent Company.\n\n## 3) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## 3.1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\n\n## Presentation currency and definition of terms\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are presented in dollars of the United States of America ('United States'), except when specific reference is made to a different currency. When reference is made to U.S. dollars or '$' it means dollars of the United States. All amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes are stated in millions, except when references are made to earnings per share and/or prices per share. When reference is made to 'Ps' or 'pesos', it means Mexican pesos. When reference is made to '\u20ac' or 'euros,' it means the currency in circulation in a significant number of European Union ('EU') countries. When reference is made to '\u00a3' or 'pounds', it means British pounds sterling. When it is deemed relevant, certain amounts in foreign currency presented in the notes to the financial statements include between parentheses a convenience translation into dollars and/or into pesos, as applicable. Previously reported convenience translations of prior years are not restated unless the transaction is still outstanding, in which case those are restated using the closing exchange rates as of the reporting date. These translations should not be construed as representations that the amounts in dollars or pesos, as applicable, represent those dollar or peso amounts or could be converted into dollar or peso at the rate indicated.\n\nAmounts disclosed in the notes in connection with outstanding tax and/or legal proceedings (notes 20.4 and 25), which are originated in jurisdictions where currencies are different from the dollar, are presented in dollar equivalents as of the closing of the most recent year presented. Consequently, without any change in the original currency, such dollar amounts will fluctuate over time due to changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Discontinued operations (note 5.2)\n\nConsidering the disposal of entire reportable operating segments as well as the sale of significant businesses, CEMEX's Statements of Operations present in the single line item of 'Discontinued operations,' the results of: a) the assets sold in the United Kingdom for the period from January 1 to August 3, 2020 and for the years 2019 and 2018; b) the assets sold in the United States for the period from January 1 to March 3, 2020 and for the years 2019 and 2018; c) the white cement business held for sale in Spain for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018; d) the French assets sold for the period from January 1 to June 28, 2019 and for the year 2018; e) the German assets sold for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2019 and for the year 2018; f) the Baltic and Nordic businesses sold for the period from January 1 to March 29, 2019 and for the year 2018; and g) the operating segment in Brazil sold for the period from January 1 to September 27, 2018.\n\n## Statements of operations\n\nCEMEX includes the line item titled 'Operating earnings before other expenses, net' considering that it is a relevant operating measure for CEMEX's management. The line item 'Other expenses, net' consists primarily of revenues and expenses not directly related to CEMEX's main activities, including impairment losses of long-lived assets, results on disposal of assets and restructuring costs, among others (note 7). Under IFRS, the inclusion of certain subtotals such as 'Operating earnings before other expenses, net' and the display of the statement of operations vary significantly by industry and company according to specific needs.\n\nConsidering that it is an indicator of CEMEX's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to measure its ability to service or incur debt under its financing agreements, for purposes of notes 5.3 and 17, CEMEX presents 'Operating EBITDA' (operating earnings before other expenses, net, plus depreciation and amortization). This is not an indicator of CEMEX's financial performance, an alternative to cash flows, a measure of liquidity or comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. In addition, this indicator is used by CEMEX's management for decision-making purposes.",

The probability threshold represents a positive assertion by management  that CEMEX is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position.

        "page_content": "## 3.2) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include those of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. and those of the entities in which the Parent Company exercises control, including structured entities (special purpose entities), by means of which the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee's relevant activities. Balances and operations between related parties are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nInvestments are accounted for by the equity method when CEMEX has significant influence which is generally presumed with a minimum equity interest of 20%. The equity method reflects in the financial statements, the investee's original cost and CEMEX's share of the investee's equity and earnings after acquisition. The financial statements of joint ventures, which relate to those arrangements in which CEMEX and other third-party investors have joint control and have rights to the net assets of the arrangements, are recognized under the equity method. During the reported periods, CEMEX did not have joint operations, referring to those cases in which the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights over specific assets and obligations for specific liabilities relating to the arrangements. The equity method is discontinued when the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interest in the investee or joint venture, is reduced to zero, unless CEMEX has incurred or guaranteed additional obligations of the investee or joint venture.\n\n## 3.3) USE OF ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. These assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis using available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The items subject to significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairment tests of long-lived assets, recognition of deferred income tax assets, as well as the measurement of financial instruments at fair value, and the assets and liabilities related to employee benefits. Significant judgment is required by management to appropriately assess the amounts of these concepts.\n\n## 3.4) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of their execution. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the statement of financial position date, and the resulting foreign exchange fluctuations are recognized in earnings, except for exchange fluctuations arising from: 1) foreign currency indebtedness associated with the acquisition of foreign entities; and 2) fluctuations associated with related parties' balances denominated in foreign currency, whose settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and as a result, such balances are of a permanent investment nature. These fluctuations are recorded against 'Other equity reserves', as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment (note 21.2) until the disposal of the foreign net investment, at which time, the accumulated amount is recognized through the statement of operations as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, as determined using their respective functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at the closing exchange rate for statement of financial position accounts and at the closing exchange rates of each month within the period for statements of operations accounts. The functional currency is that in which each consolidated entity primarily generates and expends cash. The corresponding translation effect is included within 'Other equity reserves' and is presented in the statement of other comprehensive income for the period as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment (note 21.2) until the disposal of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.\n\nConsidering its integrated activities, for purposes of functional currency, the Parent Company is considered to have two divisions, one related with its financial and holding company activities, in which the functional currency is the dollar for all assets, liabilities and transactions associated with these activities, and another division related with the Parent Company's operating activities in Mexico, in which the functional currency is the peso for all assets, liabilities and transactions associated with these activities.",

These fixed-income investments are recorded at cost plus accrued interest. Accrued interest is included in the income statement as part of 'Financial income and other items, net.'\n\nTo the extent that any restriction will be lifted in less than three months from the statement of financial position reporting date, the amount of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position includes restricted cash and investments, when applicable, comprised of deposits in margin accounts that guarantee certain of CEMEX's obligations, except when contracts contain provisions for net settlement, in which case, these restricted amounts of cash and cash equivalents are offset against the liabilities that CEMEX has with its counterparties. When the restriction period is greater than three months, any restricted balance of cash and investments is not considered cash equivalents and is included within short-term or long-term 'Other accounts receivable,' as appropriate.\n\n## 3.6) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets are classified as 'Held to collect' and measured at amortized cost when they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: a) are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and b) its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Amortized cost represents the net present value ('NPV') of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and cash equivalents (notes 3.5 and 9).\n- \u00b7 Trade receivables, other current accounts receivable and other current assets (notes 10 and 11). Due to their short-term nature, CEMEX initially recognizes these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses, as explained below.\n- \u00b7 Trade receivables sold under securitization programs, in which certain residual interest in the trade receivables sold in case of recovery failure and continued involvement in such assets is maintained, do not qualify for derecognition and are maintained in the statement of financial position (notes 10 and 17.2).\n- \u00b7 Investments and non-current accounts receivable (note 14.2). Subsequent changes in effects from amortized cost are recognized in the income statement as part of 'Financial income and other items, net'.\n\nCertain strategic investments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income within 'Other equity reserves' (note 14.2). CEMEX does not maintain financial assets 'Held to collect and sell' whose business model has the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and then selling those financial assets.\n\nThe financial assets that are not classified as 'Held to collect' or that do not have strategic characteristics fall into the residual category of held at fair value through the income statement as part of 'Financial income and other items, net' (note 14.2).\n\nDebt instruments and other financial obligations are classified as 'Loans' and measured at amortized cost (notes 17.1 and 17.2). Interest accrued on financial instruments is recognized within 'Other accounts payable and accrued expenses' against financial expense. During the reported periods, CEMEX did not have financial liabilities voluntarily recognized at fair value or associated with fair value hedge strategies with derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at their estimated fair values, and the changes in such fair values are recognized in the income statement within 'Financial income and other items, net' for the period in which they occur, except in the case of hedging instruments as described below (note 17.4).",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of financial assets\n\nImpairment losses of financial assets, including trade accounts receivable, are recognized using the Expected Credit Loss model ('ECL') for the entire lifetime of such financial assets on initial recognition, and at each subsequent reporting period, even in the absence of a credit event or if a loss has not yet been incurred, considering for their measurement past events and current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts affecting collectability. For purposes of the ECL model of trade accounts receivable, CEMEX segments its accounts receivable in a matrix by country, type of client or homogeneous credit risk and days past due and determines for each segment an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 24 months and analyses of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable. The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the segment of 365 days or more past due.\n\n## Costs incurred in the issuance of debt or borrowings\n\nDirect costs incurred in debt issuances or borrowings, as well as debt refinancing or non-substantial modifications to debt agreements that did not represent an extinguishment of debt by considering that the holders and the relevant economic terms of the new instrument are not substantially different to the replaced instrument, adjust the carrying amount of the related debt and are amortized as interest expense as part of the effective interest rate of each instrument over its maturity. These costs include commissions and professional fees. Costs incurred in the extinguishment of debt, as well as debt refinancing or modifications to debt agreements, when the new instrument is substantially different from the old instrument according to a qualitative and quantitative analysis, are recognized in the income statement as incurred.\n\n## Leases (notes 3.8, 15 and 17.2)\n\nAt the inception of a lease contract, CEMEX assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration. CEMEX uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16, Leases ('IFRS 16') to assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\n\nBased on IFRS 16, leases are recognized as financial liabilities against assets for the right-of-use, measured at their commencement date as the net present value ('NPV') of the future contractual fixed payments, using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, CEMEX's incremental borrowing rate. CEMEX determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from its external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease, the type of the asset leased and the economic environment in which the asset is leased.\n\nCEMEX does not separate the non-lease component from the lease component included in the same contract. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise contractual rental fixed payments, less incentives, fixed payments of non-lease components and the value of a purchase option, to the extent that option is highly probable to be exercised or is considered a bargain purchase option. Interest incurred under the financial obligations related to lease contracts is recognized as part of the 'Interest expense' line item in the income statement.\n\nAt commencement date or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, CEMEX allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices. CEMEX applies the recognition exception for lease terms of 12 months or less and contracts of lowvalue assets and recognizes the lease payment of these leases as rental expense in the income statement over the lease term. CEMEX defined the lease contracts related to office and computer equipment as low-value assets.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method as payments are incurred and is remeasured when: a) there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, b) if there is a change in the amount expected to be payable under a residual guarantee, c) if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option, or d) if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the asset for the right-of-use or is recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' if such asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n## Financial instruments with components of both liabilities and equity (note 17.2)\n\nFinancial instruments that contain components of both liability and equity, such as notes convertible into a fixed number of the issuer's shares and denominated its same functional currency, are accounted for by each component being recognized separately in the statement of financial position according to the specific characteristics of each transaction. In the case of instruments mandatorily convertible into shares of the issuer, the liability component represents the NPV of interest payments on the principal amount using a market interest rate, without assuming early conversion, and is recognized within 'Other financial obligations,' whereas the equity component represents the difference between the principal amount and the liability component, and is recognized within 'Other equity reserves,' net of commissions. In the case of instruments that are optionally convertible into a fixed number of shares, the equity component represents the difference between the total proceeds received for issuing the financial instruments and the fair value of the financial liability component (note 3.14). When the transaction is denominated in a currency different than the functional currency of the issuer, the conversion option is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument at fair value in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Hedging instruments (note 17.4)\n\nA hedging relationship is established to the extent the entity considers, based on the analysis of the overall characteristics of the hedging and hedged items, that the hedge will be highly effective in the future and the hedge relationship at inception is aligned with the entity's reported risk management strategy (note 17.5). The accounting categories of hedging instruments are: a) cash flow hedge; b) fair value hedge of an asset or forecasted transaction; and c) hedge of a net investment in a subsidiary.\n\nIn cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in stockholders' equity within other equity reserves and are reclassified to earnings as the interest expense of the related debt is accrued, in the case of interest rate swaps, or when the underlying products are consumed in the case of contracts on the price of raw materials and commodities. In hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in fair value are recognized in stockholders' equity as part of the foreign currency translation result within 'Other equity reserves' (note 3.4), whose reversal to earnings would take place upon disposal of the foreign investment. During the reported periods, CEMEX did not have derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Derivative instruments are negotiated with institutions with significant financial capacity; therefore, CEMEX believes the risk of non-performance of the obligations agreed to by such counterparties to be minimal.\n\n## Embedded derivative financial instruments\n\nCEMEX reviews its contracts to identify the existence of embedded derivatives. Identified embedded derivatives are analyzed to determine if they need to be separated from the host contract and recognized in the statement of financial position as assets or liabilities, applying the same valuation rules used for other derivative instruments.\n\n## Put options granted for the purchase of non-controlling interests\n\nUnder IFRS 9, represent agreements by means of which a non-controlling interest has the right to sell, at a future date using a predefined price formula or at fair market value, its shares in a consolidated subsidiary. When the obligation should be settled in cash or through the delivery of another financial asset, an entity should recognize a liability for the NPV of the redemption amount as of the reporting date against the controlling interest within stockholders' equity. A liability is not recognized under these agreements when the redemption amount is determined at fair market value at the exercise date and the entity has the election to settle using its own shares. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX did not have written put options.\n\n## Fair value measurements (note 17.3)\n\nUnder IFRS, fair value represents an 'Exit Value' which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, considering the counterparty's credit risk in the valuation. The concept of Exit Value is premised on the existence of a market and market participants for the specific asset or liability. When there are no market and/or market participants willing to make a market, IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\n\n## The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1.- represent quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that CEMEX can access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available.\n- \u00b7 Level 2.- are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and are used mainly to determine the fair value of securities, investments or loans that are not actively traded. Level 2 inputs included equity prices, certain interest rates and yield curves, implied volatility and credit spreads, among others, as well as inputs extrapolated from other observable inputs. In the absence of Level 1 inputs, CEMEX determined fair values by iteration of the applicable Level 2 inputs, the number of securities and/or the other relevant terms of the contract, as applicable.\n- \u00b7 Level 3.- inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. CEMEX used unobservable inputs to determine fair values, to the extent there are no Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, in valuation models such as Black-Scholes, binomial, discounted cash flows or multiples of Operative EBITDA, including risk assumptions consistent with what market participants would use to arrive at fair value.\n\n## 3.7) INVENTORIES (note 12)\n\nInventories are valued using the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost formula and includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. CEMEX analyzes its inventory balances to determine if, because of internal events, such as physical damage, or external events, such as technological changes or market conditions, certain portions of such balances have become obsolete or impaired. When an impairment situation arises, the inventory balance is adjusted to its net realizable value. In such cases, these adjustments are recognized against the results of the period. Advances to suppliers of inventory are presented as part of other current assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation of fixed assets is recognized as part of cost and operating expenses (note 6) and is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, except for mineral reserves, which are depleted using the units-of-production method. As of December 31, 2020, the average useful lives by category of fixed assets, which are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate, were as follows:\n\n|                                     |   Years |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Administrative buildings            |      31 |\n| Industrial buildings                |      26 |\n| Machinery and equipment in plant    |      15 |\n| Ready-mix trucks and motor vehicles |       9 |\n| Office equipment and other assets   |       6 |\n\nAssets for the right-of-use related to leases are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle, remove or restore the underlaying asset, less any lease incentives received. The asset for the right-of-use is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlaying asset to CEMEX by the end of the lease term or if the cost of the asset for the right-of-use reflects that CEMEX will exercise a purchase option. In that case the asset for the right-of-use would be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, assets for the right-of-use may be reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nCEMEX capitalizes, as part of the related cost of fixed assets, interest expense from existing debt during the construction or installation period of significant fixed assets, considering CEMEX's corporate average interest rate and the average balance of investments in process for the period.\n\nAll waste removal costs or stripping costs incurred in the operative phase of a surface mine to access the mineral reserves are recognized as part of the carrying amount of the related quarries. The capitalized amounts are further amortized over the expected useful life of exposed ore body based on the unitsof-production method.\n\nCosts incurred in respect of operating fixed assets that result in future economic benefits, such as an extension in their useful lives, an increase in their production capacity or in safety, as well as those costs incurred to mitigate or prevent environmental damage, are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets. The capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of such fixed assets. Periodic maintenance of fixed assets is expensed as incurred. Advances to suppliers of fixed assets are presented as part of other long-term accounts receivable.\n\n## 3.9) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (notes 5.1 and 16)\n\nBusiness combinations are recognized using the acquisition method, by allocating the consideration transferred to assume control of the entity to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets acquired are identified and recognized at fair value. Any unallocated portion of the purchase price represents goodwill, which is not amortized and is subject to periodic impairment tests (note 3.10). Goodwill may be adjusted for any change to the preliminary assessment given to the assets acquired and/or liabilities assumed within the twelve-month period after purchase. Costs associated with the acquisition are expensed in the income statement as incurred.\n\nCEMEX capitalizes intangible assets acquired, as well as costs incurred in the development of intangible assets, when probable future economic benefits associated are identified and there is evidence of control over such benefits. Intangible assets are recognized at their acquisition or development cost, as applicable. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized since the period in which the benefits associated with such intangibles will terminate cannot be accurately established. Definite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis as part of operating costs and expenses (note 6).\n\nStartup costs are recognized in the income statement as they are incurred. Costs associated with research and development activities ('R&D activities'), performed by CEMEX to create products and services, as well as to develop processes, equipment and methods to optimize operational efficiency and reduce costs are recognized in the operating results as incurred. Direct costs incurred in the development stage of computer software for internal use are capitalized and amortized through the operating results over the useful life of the software, which on average is approximately 5 years.",

        "page_content": "Costs incurred in exploration activities such as payments for rights to explore, topographical and geological studies, as well as trenching, among other items incurred to assess the technical and commercial feasibility of extracting a mineral resource, which are not significant to CEMEX, are capitalized when probable future economic benefits associated with such activities are identified. When extraction begins, these costs are amortized during the useful life of the quarry based on the estimated tons of material to be extracted. When future economic benefits are not achieved, any capitalized costs are subject to impairment.\n\nCEMEX's extraction rights have weighted-average useful lives of 83 years, depending on the sector and the expected life of the related reserves. As of December 31, 2020, except for extraction rights and/or as otherwise indicated, CEMEX's intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives that range on average from 3 to 20 years.\n\n## 3.10) IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (notes 15 and 16)\n\n## Property, machinery and equipment, assets for the right-of-use, intangible assets of definite life and other investments\n\nThese assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of internal or external indicators of impairment, such as changes in CEMEX's operating business model or in technology that affect the asset, or expectations of lower operating results, to determine whether their carrying amounts may not be recovered. An impairment loss is recorded in the income statement for the period within 'Other expenses, net,' for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its recoverable amount, corresponding to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell the asset, as generally determined by an external appraiser, and the asset's value in use, the latter represented by the NPV of estimated cash flows related to the use and eventual disposal of the asset. The main assumptions utilized to develop estimates of NPV are a discount rate that reflects the risk of the cash flows associated with the assets and the estimations of generation of future income. Those assumptions are evaluated for reasonableness by comparing such discount rates to available market information and by comparing to thirdparty expectations of industry growth, such as governmental agencies or industry chambers.\n\nWhen impairment indicators exist, for each intangible asset, CEMEX determines its projected revenue streams over the estimated useful life of the asset. To obtain discounted cash flows attributable to each intangible asset, such revenue is adjusted for operating expenses, changes in working capital and other expenditures, as applicable, and discounted to NPV using the risk adjusted discount rate of return. The most significant economic assumptions are: a) the useful life of the asset; b) the risk adjusted discount rate of return; c) royalty rates; and d) growth rates. Assumptions used for these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts and industry practices. The fair values of these assets are significantly sensitive to changes in such relevant assumptions. Certain key assumptions are more subjective than others. In respect of trademarks, CEMEX considers that the most subjective key assumption is the royalty rate. In respect of extraction rights and customer relationships, the most subjective assumptions are revenue growth rates and estimated useful lives. CEMEX validates its assumptions through benchmarking with industry practices and the corroboration of third-party valuation advisors. Significant judgment by management is required to appropriately assess the fair values and values in use of the related assets, as well as to determine the appropriate valuation method and select the significant economic assumptions.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment when required upon the occurrence of internal or external indicators of impairment or at least once a year, during the last quarter of such year. CEMEX determines the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units ('CGUs') to which goodwill balances were allocated, which consists of the higher of such group of CGUs fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, the latter represented by the NPV of estimated future cash flows to be generated by such CGUs to which goodwill was allocated, which are generally determined over periods of 5 years. If the value in use of a group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is lower than its corresponding carrying amount, CEMEX determines the fair value of such group of CGUs using methodologies generally accepted in the market to determine the value of entities, such as multiples of Operating EBITDA and by reference to other market transactions. An impairment loss is recognized within 'Other expenses, net', if the recoverable amount is lower than the net book value of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Impairment charges recognized on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Impairment of long-lived assets - Goodwill\n\nThe reportable segments reported by CEMEX (note 5.3), represent CEMEX's groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, considering: a) that after the acquisition, goodwill was allocated at the level of the reportable segment; b) that the operating components that comprise the reported segment have similar economic characteristics; c) that the reported segments are used by CEMEX to organize and evaluate its activities in its internal information system; d) the homogeneous nature of the items produced and traded in each operative component, which are all used by the construction industry; e) the vertical integration in the value chain of the products comprising each component; f) the type of clients, which are substantially similar in all components; g) the operative integration among components; and h) that the compensation system of a specific country is based on the consolidated results of the geographic segment and not on the particular results of the components. In addition, the country level represents the lowest level within CEMEX at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Impairment tests are significantly sensitive to the estimation of future prices of CEMEX's products, the development of operating expenses, local and international economic trends in the construction industry, the long-term growth expectations in the different markets, as well as the discount rates and the growth rates in perpetuity applied. For purposes of estimating future prices, CEMEX uses, to the extent available, historical data; plus the expected increase or decrease according to information issued by trusted external sources, such as national construction or cement producer chambers and/or in governmental economic expectations. Operating expenses are normally measured as a constant proportion of revenues, following experience. However, such operating expenses are also reviewed considering external information sources in respect of inputs that behave according to international prices, such as oil and gas. CEMEX uses specific pre-tax discount rates for each group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, which are applied to discount pre-tax cash flows. The amounts of estimated undiscounted cash flows are significantly sensitive to the growth rate in perpetuity applied. The higher the growth rate in perpetuity applied, the higher the amount of undiscounted future cash flows by group of CGUs obtained. Moreover, the amounts of discounted estimated future cash flows are significantly sensitive to the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) applied. The higher the discount rate applied, the lower the amount of discounted estimated future cash flows by group of CGUs obtained.\n\n## 3.11) PROVISIONS\n\nCEMEX recognizes provisions when it has a legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events, whose resolution would require cash outflows, or the delivery of other resources owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, some significant proceedings that gave rise to a portion of the carrying amount of CEMEX's other current and non-current liabilities and provisions are detailed in note 25.1.\n\nConsidering guidance under IFRS, CEMEX recognizes provisions for levies imposed by governments when the obligating event or the activity that triggers the payment of the levy has occurred, as defined in the legislation.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nCEMEX recognizes provisions for restructuring when the restructuring detailed plans have been properly finalized and authorized by management and have been communicated to the third parties involved and/or affected by the restructuring prior to the statement of financial position's date. These provisions may include costs not associated with CEMEX's ongoing activities.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations (note 18)\n\nUnavoidable obligations, legal or constructive, to restore operating sites upon retirement of long-lived assets at the end of their useful lives are measured at the NPV of estimated future cash flows to be incurred in the restoration process and are initially recognized against the related assets' book value. The increase to the assets' book value is depreciated during its remaining useful life. The increase in the liability related to adjustments to NPV by the passage of time is charged to the line item 'Financial income and other items, net.' Adjustments to the liability for changes in estimations are recognized against fixed assets, and depreciation is modified prospectively. These obligations are related mainly to future costs of demolition, cleaning and reforestation, so that quarries, maritime terminals and other production sites are left in acceptable condition at the end of their operation.\n\n## Costs related to remediation of the environment (notes 18 and 25)\n\nProvisions associated with environmental damage represent the estimated future cost of remediation, which are recognized at their nominal value when the time schedule for the disbursement is not clear, or when the economic effect for the passage of time is not significant; otherwise, such provisions are recognized at their discounted values. Reimbursements from insurance companies are recognized as assets only when their recovery is practically certain. In that case, such reimbursement assets are not offset against the provision for remediation costs.\n\n## Contingencies and commitments (notes 24 and 25)\n\nObligations or losses related to contingencies are recognized as liabilities in the statement of financial position only when present obligations exist resulting from past events that are probable to result in an outflow of resources and the amount can be measured reliably. Otherwise, a qualitative disclosure is included in the notes to the financial statements. The effects of long-term commitments established with third parties, such as supply contracts with suppliers or customers, are recognized in the financial statements on an incurred or accrued basis, after taking into consideration the substance of the agreements. Relevant commitments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The Company recognizes contingent revenues, income or assets only when their realization is virtually certain.",

        "page_content": "## 3.12) PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (note 19)\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nThe costs of defined contribution pension plans are recognized in the operating results as they are incurred. Liabilities arising from such plans are settled through cash transfers to the employees' retirement accounts, without generating future obligations.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits\n\nThe costs associated with employees' benefits for defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits, generally comprised of health care benefits, life insurance and seniority premiums, granted by CEMEX and/or pursuant to applicable law, are recognized as services are rendered by the employees based on actuarial estimations of the benefits' present value considering the advice of external actuaries. For certain pension plans, CEMEX has created irrevocable trust funds to cover future benefit payments ('plan assets'). These plan assets are valued at their estimated fair value at the statement of financial position date. The actuarial assumptions and accounting policy consider: a) the use of nominal rates; b) a single rate is used for the determination of the expected return on plan assets and the discount of the benefits obligation to present value; c) a net interest is recognized on the net defined benefit liability (liability minus plan assets); and d) all actuarial gains and losses for the period, related to differences between the projected and real actuarial assumptions at the end of the period, as well as the difference between the expected and real return on plan assets, are recognized as part of 'Other items of comprehensive income, net' within stockholders' equity.\n\nThe service cost, corresponding to the increase in the obligation for additional benefits earned by employees during the period, is recognized within operating costs and expenses. The net interest cost, resulting from the increase in obligations for changes in NPV and the change during the period in the estimated fair value of plan assets, is recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net.'\n\nThe effects from modifications to the pension plans that affect the cost of past services are recognized within operating costs and expenses over the period in which such modifications become effective to the employees or without delay if changes are effective immediately. Likewise, the effects from curtailments and/or settlements of obligations occurring during the period, associated with events that significantly reduce the cost of future services and/or significantly reduce the population subject to pension benefits, respectively, are recognized within operating costs and expenses.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits, not associated with a restructuring event, which mainly represent severance payments by law, are recognized in the operating results for the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 3.13) INCOME TAXES (note 20)\n\nThe effects reflected in the income statement for income taxes include the amounts incurred during the period and the amounts of deferred income taxes, determined according to the income tax law applicable to each subsidiary, reflecting uncertainty in income tax treatments, if any. Consolidated deferred income taxes represent the addition of the amounts determined in each subsidiary by applying the enacted statutory income tax rate or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period to the total temporary differences resulting from comparing the book and taxable values of assets and liabilities, considering tax assets such as loss carryforwards and other recoverable taxes, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The measurement of deferred income taxes at the reporting period reflects the tax consequences that follow the way in which CEMEX expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes for the period represent the difference between balances of deferred income taxes at the beginning and the end of the period. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities relating to different tax jurisdictions are not offset. According to IFRS, all items charged or credited directly in stockholders' equity or as part of other comprehensive income or loss for the period are recognized net of their current and deferred income tax effects. The effect of a change in enacted statutory tax rates is recognized in the period in which the change is officially enacted.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced when it is not deemed probable that the related tax benefit will be realized, considering the aggregate amount of self-determined tax loss carryforwards that CEMEX believes will not be rejected by the tax authorities based on available evidence and the likelihood of recovering them prior to their expiration through an analysis of estimated future taxable income. If it is probable that the tax authorities would reject a self-determined deferred tax asset, CEMEX would decrease such asset. When it is considered that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered before its expiration, CEMEX would not recognize such deferred tax asset. Both situations would result in additional income tax expense for the period in which such determination is made. To determine whether it is probable that deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered, CEMEX takes into consideration all available positive and negative evidence, including factors such as market conditions, industry analysis, expansion plans, projected taxable income, carryforward periods, current tax structure, potential changes or adjustments in tax structure, tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences. Likewise, CEMEX analyzes its actual results versus the Company's estimates, and adjusts, as necessary, its tax asset valuations. If actual results vary from CEMEX's estimates, the deferred tax asset and/or valuations may be affected, and necessary adjustments will be made based on relevant information in CEMEX's income statement for such period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Based on IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over income tax treatments ('IFRIC 23'), the income tax effects from an uncertain tax position are recognized when it is probable that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and assuming that the tax authorities will examine each position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. For each position is considered individually its probability, regardless of its relation to any other broader tax settlement. The probability threshold represents a positive assertion by management that CEMEX is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position. If a tax position is considered not probable of being sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as part of the income tax in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe effective income tax rate is determined dividing the line item 'Income tax' by the line item 'Earnings before income tax.' This effective tax rate is further reconciled to CEMEX's statutory tax rate applicable in Mexico (note 20.3). A significant effect in CEMEX's effective tax rate and consequently in the reconciliation of CEMEX's effective tax rate, relates to the difference between the statutory income tax rate in Mexico of 30% against the applicable income tax rates of each country where CEMEX operates.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the statutory tax rates in CEMEX's main operations were as follows:\n\n| Country        | 2020         | 2019         | 2018         |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Mexico         | 30.0%        | 30.0%        | 30.0%        |\n| United States  | 21.0%        | 21.0%        | 21.0%        |\n| United Kingdom | 19.0%        | 19.3%        | 19.3%        |\n| France         | 32.0%        | 34.4%        | 34.4%        |\n| Germany        | 28.2%        | 28.2%        | 28.2%        |\n| Spain          | 25.0%        | 25.0%        | 25.0%        |\n| Philippines    | 30.0%        | 30.0%        | 30.0%        |\n| Colombia       | 32.0%        | 33.0%        | 37.0%        |\n| Others         | 9.0% - 30.0% | 7.8% - 35.0% | 7.8% - 39.0% |\n\nCEMEX's current and deferred income tax amounts included in the income statement for the period are highly variable, and are subject, among other factors, to taxable income determined in each jurisdiction in which CEMEX operates. Such amounts of taxable income depend on factors such as sale volumes and prices, costs and expenses, exchange rate fluctuations and interest on debt, among others, as well as to the estimated tax assets at the end of the period due to the expected future generation of taxable gains in each jurisdiction.\n\n## 3.14) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n## Common stock and additional paid-in capital (note 21.1)\n\nThese items represent the value of stockholders' contributions, and include increases related to the capitalization of retained earnings and the recognition of executive compensation programs in CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.'s CPOs as well as decreases associated with the restitution of retained earnings.\n\n## Other equity reserves (note 21.2)\n\nGroups the cumulative effects of items and transactions that are, temporarily or permanently, recognized directly to stockholders' equity, and includes the comprehensive income, which reflects certain changes in stockholders' equity that do not result from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The most significant items within 'Other equity reserves' during the reported periods are as follows:\n\n## Items of 'Other equity reserves' included within other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7 Currency translation effects from the translation of foreign subsidiaries, net of: a) exchange results from foreign currency debt directly related to the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries; and b) exchange results from foreign currency related parties' balances that are of a non-current investment class (note 3.4);\n- \u00b7 The effective portion of the valuation and liquidation effects from derivative financial instruments under cash flow hedging relationships, which are recorded temporarily in stockholders' equity (note 3.6);\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value of other investments in strategic securities (note 3.6); and\n- \u00b7 Current and deferred income taxes during the period arising from items whose effects are directly recognized in stockholders' equity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenues are decreased by any trade discounts or volume rebates granted to customers. Transactions between related parties are eliminated in consolidation. Variable consideration is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized for the contract will not occur and is measured using the expected value or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount based on the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\nRevenue and costs from trading activities, in which CEMEX acquires finished goods from a third party and subsequently sells the goods to another thirdparty, are recognized on a gross basis, considering that CEMEX assumes ownership risks on the goods purchased, not acting as agent or broker.\n\nWhen revenue is earned over time as contractual performance obligations are satisfied, which is the case of construction contracts, CEMEX applies the stage of completion method to measure revenue, which represents: a) the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs; b) the surveys of work performed; or c) the physical proportion of the contract work completed; whichever better reflects the percentage of completion under the specific circumstances. Revenue related to such construction contracts is recognized in the period in which the work is performed by reference to the contract's stage of completion at the end of the period, considering that the following have been defined: a) each party's enforceable rights regarding the asset under construction; b) the consideration to be exchanged; c) the manner and terms of settlement; d) actual costs incurred and contract costs required to complete the asset are effectively controlled; and e) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the entity.\n\nProgress payments and advances received from customers do not reflect the work performed and are recognized as short-term or long-term advanced payments, as appropriate.\n\n## 3.16)  COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES (note 6)\n\nCost of sales represents the production cost of inventories at the moment of sale. Such cost of sales includes depreciation, amortization and depletion of assets involved in production, expenses related to storage in production plants and freight expenses of raw material in plants and delivery expenses of CEMEX's ready-mix concrete business.\n\nAdministrative expenses represent the expenses associated with personnel, services and equipment, including depreciation and amortization, related to managerial activities and back office for the Company's management.\n\nSales expenses represent the expenses associated with personnel, services and equipment, including depreciation and amortization, involved specifically in sales activities.\n\nDistribution and logistics expenses refer to expenses of storage at points of sales, including depreciation and amortization, as well as freight expenses of finished products between plants and points of sale and freight expenses between points of sales and the customers' facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cost of equity instruments represents their estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized in the income statement during the period in which the exercise rights of the employees become vested. In respect of liability instruments, these instruments are valued at their estimated fair value at each reporting date, recognizing the changes in fair value through the operating results.\n\n## 3.18)  EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE ('CO2')\n\nThe cement industry releases CO2 as part of the production process. In certain countries where CEMEX operates, such as EU countries, mechanisms aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions have been established by means of which, the relevant environmental authorities grant annually certain number of emission rights ('certificates') so far free of cost to the different industries releasing CO2. Industries in turn must submit to such environmental authorities at the end of a compliance period, certificates for a volume equivalent to the tons of CO2 released. Companies must obtain additional certificates to meet deficits between actual CO2 emissions during the compliance period and certificates received, or they can dispose of any surplus of certificates in the market. In addition, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('UNFCCC') granted Certified Emission Reductions ('CERs') to qualified CO2 emission reduction projects. Until the compliance phase that finalized in 2020, CERs could be used in specified proportions to settle emission rights obligations in the EU. In the current phase from 2021 to 2030, CERs are no longer valid to settle emission rights obligations in the EU. Nonetheless, CEMEX actively participates in the development of projects aimed to reduce CO2 emissions, some of which have been awarded with CERs. In general, failure to meet the emissions caps is subject to significant monetary penalties. The cap is reduced over time so that the total volume of emissions will decrease.\n\nFurther to the strategy to address climate change that CEMEX announced in February 2020, on December 3, 2020, CEMEX hosted a Climate Action panel to present the progress on climate action and the roadmap to achieve the Company's 2030 and 2050 goals, which are mainly a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions and delivery of net-zero CO2 concrete for all products and geographies, respectively (unaudited). The 35% CO2 emissions reductions target by 2030 is aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') methodology. SBTi drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set science-based emissions reductions targets. To meet this target, this objective has been included in the variable compensation of senior management and CEMEX has detailed CO2 roadmaps developed for each cement plant which include a roll-out of proven CO2 reduction technologies and the investments required for their implementation. Furthermore, CEMEX works towards delivering net-zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050, which should contribute to the development of smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate-resilient infrastructure. These reduction targets were included in 2020 in a portion of CEMEX's debt, and their grade of accomplishment, will represent increases or decreases to the interest rate (note 17.1).\n\nCEMEX does not maintain emission rights, CERs and/or enters in forward transactions with trading purposes. CEMEX accounts for the effects associated with CO2 emission reduction mechanisms as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Certificates received for free are not recognized in the statement of financial position. Revenues from the sale of any surplus of certificates are recognized by decreasing cost of sales. In forward sale transactions, revenues are recognized upon physical delivery of the emission certificates.\n- \u00b7 Certificates and/or CERs acquired to hedge current CO2 emissions are recognized as intangible assets at cost and are further amortized to cost of sales during the compliance period. In the case of forward purchases, assets are recognized upon physical reception of the certificates.\n- \u00b7 CEMEX accrues a provision against cost of sales when the estimated annual emissions of CO2 are expected to exceed the number of emission rights, net of any benefit obtained through swap transactions of emission rights for CERs.\n- \u00b7 CERs received from the UNFCCC were recognized as intangible assets at their development cost, which are attributable mainly to legal expenses incurred in the process of obtaining such CERs.\n\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no sales of emission rights to third parties. In addition, in certain countries, the environmental authorities impose levies per ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases released. Such expenses are recognized as part of cost of sales as incurred.\n\n## 3.19)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT\n\nCEMEX sells its products primarily to distributors in the construction industry, with no specific geographic concentration within the countries in which CEMEX operates. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single customer individually accounted for a significant amount of the reported amounts of sales or in the balances of trade receivables. In addition, there is no significant concentration of a specific supplier relating to the purchase of raw materials.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CEMEX operates geographically and by business on a regional basis.\n\nBeginning April 1, 2020 and for subsequent periods, the geographical regions Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa ('AMEA') were merged and reorganized under a single regional president and was denominated Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia ('EMEAA'). For the reported periods, the Company's operations were organized in four geographical regions, each under the supervision of a regional president, as follows: 1) Mexico, 2) United States, 3) EMEAA and 4) South, Central America and the Caribbean ('SCA&C'). The accounting policies applied to determine the financial information by reportable segment are consistent with those described in note 3.\n\nConsidering similar regional and economic characteristics and/or materiality, certain countries have been aggregated and presented as single line items as follows: a) 'Rest of EMEAA' refers mainly to CEMEX's operations and activities in Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates; b) 'Rest of SCA&C' refers mainly to CEMEX's operations and activities in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Jamaica, the Caribbean, Guatemala and El Salvador, excluding the operations of Trinidad Cement Limited ('TCL'); and c) 'Caribbean TCL' refers to TCL's operations mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados. The segment 'Others' refers to: 1) cement trade maritime operations, 2) Neoris N.V., CEMEX's subsidiary involved in the business of information technology solutions, 3) the Parent Company, other corporate entities and finance subsidiaries, and 4) other minor subsidiaries with different lines of business.",

Therefore, the trade accounts receivable sold were not removed from the statement of financial position and the funded amounts to CEMEX of $586 in 2020 and $599 in 2019, were recognized within the line item of 'Other financial obligations.' Trade accounts receivable qualifying for sale exclude amounts over certain days past due or concentrations over certain limits to any one customer, according to the terms of the programs. The discount granted to the acquirers of the trade accounts receivable is recorded as financial expense and amounted to $13 in 2020, $25 in 2019 and $23 in 2018. CEMEX's securitization programs are usually negotiated for periods of one to two years and are usually renewed at their maturity.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the balances of trade accounts receivable and the allowance for Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') were as follows:\n\n|                                          | Accounts   receivable   |   ECL  allowance | ECL  average rate   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Mexico                                   | $  284                  |               38 | 13.7%               |\n| United States                            | 477                     |                8 | 1.7%                |\n| Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia     | 766                     |               51 | 6.7%                |\n| South, Central America and the Caribbean | 94                      |               20 | 21.3%               |\n| Others                                   | 33                      |                4 | 12.1%               |\n|                                          | $  1,654                |              121 |                     |\n\nChanges in the allowance for expected credit losses in 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:\n\n|                                                              | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Allowances for expected credit losses at beginning of period | $  116 | 119    | 109    |\n| Adoption effects of ECL model as of January 1, 2018          | -      | -      | 29     |\n| Charged to selling expenses                                  | 23     | 12     | 8      |\n| Deductions                                                   | (19)   | (16)   | (20)   |\n| Foreign currency translation effects                         | 1      | 1      | (7)    |\n| Allowances for expected credit losses at end of period       | $  121 | 116    | 119    |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, in relation to the COVID-19 Pandemic (note 2) and the potential increase in expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable because of the negative economic effects associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic, CEMEX maintains continuous communication with its customers as part of its collection management, in order to anticipate situations that could represent an extension in the portfolio's recovery period or in some cases the risk of non-recovery. As of this same date, the Company considers that these negative effects do not yet have a significant impact on the estimates of expected credit losses and will continue to monitor the development of relevant events that may eventually have effect because of a deepening or extension of the COVID-19 Pandemic.",

In 2019 due to the continued adverse outlook and the overall uncertain economic conditions in Puerto Rico after hurricane 'Maria' in 2017, CEMEX recognized an impairment loss of $52.\n\nThese losses result from the excess of the net book value of the related assets against their respective use value or estimated realizable value, whichever is greater. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, CEMEX adjusted the related fixed assets to their estimated value in use in those circumstances in which the assets would continue in operation based on estimated cash flows during the remaining useful life, or to their realizable value, in case of permanent shut down, and recognized impairment losses within the line item of 'Other expenses, net' (notes 3.10 and 7).",

The value in use is represented by the discounted cash flows projections related to such CGUs using risk adjusted discount rates. In addition to the periodic goodwill impairment tests performed at year end 2020, considering the negative effects on its operating results caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic (note 2), as well as the high uncertainty and lack of visibility in relation to the duration and consequences in the different markets where the Company operates, management considered that impairment indicators occurred during the third quarter of 2020 in its operating segments in the United States, Spain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and consequently carried out impairment analyses of goodwill as of September 30, 2020.\n\nAs a result of these impairment analyses, in the third quarter of 2020, the Company recognized within 'Other expenses, net' (note 7) in the statement of operations, a non-cash goodwill impairment loss for an amount of $1,020 in connection with its operating segment in the United States. No other impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2020 resulted in additional goodwill impairment losses. Moreover, CEMEX did not determine additional impairment losses in its goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2020 in any of the groups of CGUs to which goodwill balances have been allocated. In 2019 and 2018, CEMEX did not determine goodwill impairment losses.",

Such changes significantly reduced the value in use as of September 30, 2020, which decreased by 25.7% as compared to December 31, 2019. Of this reduction, 51.5 percentage points ('p.p.') were related to the decrease of two years in the cash flows projections, 27.3 p.p. resulted from the reduction in the long-term growth rate used to determine the terminal value which changed from 2.5% in 2019 to 2.0% as of September 30, 2020, and 28.3 p.p. resulted from the slowdown of sales growth over the projected years, partially compensated by a positive effect of 7.1 p.p. associated with the reduction in the discount rate which decrease from 7.8% in 2019 to 7.7% as of September 30, 2020.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill balances allocated by operating segment were as follows:\n\n|                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Mexico                      | 372    | 384    |\n| United States               | 6,449  | 7,469  |\n| EMEAA                       |        |        |\n| Spain                       | 463    | 494    |\n| United Kingdom              | 292    | 279    |\n| France                      | 229    | 221    |\n| Philippines                 | 95     | 92     |\n| United Arab Emirates        | 96     | 96     |\n| Rest of EMEAA  1            | 44     | 42     |\n| SCA&C                       |        |        |\n| Caribbean TCL               | 283    | 296    |\n| Caribe TCL                  | 92     | 100    |\n| Rest of SCA&C  2            | 64     | 62     |\n| Others                      |        |        |\n| Other reporting segments  3 | 27     | 27     |\n|                             | 8,506  | 9,562  |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, CEMEX's pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates used to determine the discounted cash flows in the group of CGUs with the main goodwill balances were as follows:\n\n|                                   | Discount rates   | Discount rates            | Discount rates   | Long-term growth rates   | Long-term growth rates   | Long-term growth rates   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Groups of CGUs                    | 2020             | 2019                      | 2018             | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2018                     |\n| United States                     | 7.3%             | 7.8%                      | 8.5%             | 2.0%                     | 2.5%                     | 2.5%                     |\n| Spain                             | 7.7%             | 8.3%                      | 8.8%             | 1.5%                     | 1.6%                     | 1.7%                     |\n| United Kingdom                    | 7.4%             | 8.0%                      | 8.4%             | 1.6%                     | 1.5%                     | 1.6%                     |\n| France                            | 7.4%             | 8.0%                      | 8.4%             | 1.7%                     | 1.4%                     | 1.6%                     |\n| Mexico                            | 8.3%             | 9.0%                      | 9.4%             | 1.1%                     | 2.4%                     | 3.0%                     |\n| Colombia                          | 8.4%             | 8.9%                      | 9.5%             | 2.5%                     | 3.7%                     | 3.6%                     |\n| United Arab Emirates              | 8.3%             | 8.8%                      | 11.0%            | 2.6%                     | 2.5%                     | 2.9%                     |\n| Egypt                             | 10.2%            | 10.3%                     | 10.8%            | 5.6%                     | 6.0%                     | 6.0%                     |\n| Range of rates in other countries |                  | 7.2% - 15.5% 8.1% - 11.5% | 8.5% - 13.3%     | (0.3%) - 6.5%            | 1.6% - 6.5%              | 2.3% - 6.9%              |\n\nThe discount rates used by CEMEX in its cash flows projections as of September 30, 2020 in the applicable countries remained relatively flat as compared to the rates determined as of December 31, 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Moreover, the discount rates used by CEMEX in its cash flows projections to determine the value in use of its operating segments as of December 31, 2020 generally decreased as compared to 2019 in a range of 0.1% up to 1.5%, mainly as a result of a decrease in 2020 in the funding cost observed in the industry that changed from 5.4% in 2019 to 4.1% in 2020 as well as the weighing of debt in the calculation of the discount rates that increased from 31.7% in 2019 to 34.6% in 2020. The risk-free rate associated to CEMEX changed from 2.9% in 2019 to 2.2% in 2020, nonetheless, increases in the specific risk rates of each country and in the market risk premium which changed from 5.6% in 2019 to 5.7% in 2020, resulted in that total cost of equity remained significantly flat in 2020 as compared to 2019 in the majority of the countries. These reductions were partially offset by a slight increase in the public comparable companies' stock volatility (beta) that changed from 1.08 in 2019 to 1.19 in 2020. In addition, as preventive measure to consider the high uncertainty, volatility and reduced visibility related to the negative effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic (note 2), CEMEX significantly reduced in certain countries its long-term growth rates used in their cash flows projections as of December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 such as in the United States in 0.5%, Mexico in 1.3% and Colombia in 1.2%. These long-term growth rates will be revised upwards or downwards again in the future as new economic data is available.\n\nThe discount rates used by CEMEX in its cash flows projections to determine the value in use of its operating segments as of December 31, 2019 generally decreased as compared to 2018 in a range of 0.6% up to 2.6%, mainly because of a decrease in 2019 in the funding cost observed in the industry that changed from 7.3% in 2018 to 5.4% in 2019. The risk-free rate associated to CEMEX remained significantly flat in the level of 2.9%, while the country risk-specific rates decreased slightly in 2019 in most cases. These reductions were partially offset by a slight increase in the public comparable companies' stock volatility (beta) that changed from 1.06 in 2018 to 1.08 in 2019 and the decrease in the weighing of debt in the calculation of the discount rates that changed from 33.5% in 2018 to 31.7% in 2019.\n\nIn connection with the discount rates and long-term growth rates included in the table above, CEMEX verified the reasonableness of its conclusions using sensitivity analyses to changes in assumptions, affecting the value in use of all groups of CGUs with an independent reasonably possible increase of 1% in the pre-tax discount rate, an independent possible decrease of 1% in the long-term growth rate, as well as using multiples of Operating EBITDA, by means of which, CEMEX determined a weighted-average multiple of Operating EBITDA to enterprise value observed in recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. The average multiple was then applied to a stabilized amount of Operating EBITDA and the result was compared to the corresponding carrying amount for each group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. CEMEX considered an industry average Operating EBITDA multiple of 11.5 times in 2020, 11.5 times in 2019 and 11.1 times in 2018.\n\nIn relation to the economic assumptions used by the Company described above, the additional impairment losses that would have resulted from the sensitivity analyses derived from independent changes in each of the relevant assumptions, as well as the multiples of Operating EBITDA, in those operating segments that presented impairment charges or relative impairment risk during 2020, are as follows:\n\n|                   |                                  | Additional effects of the sensitivity analyses   to the charges recognized from the changes   in assumptions as of December 31,  2020   | Additional effects of the sensitivity analyses   to the charges recognized from the changes   in assumptions as of December 31,  2020   | Additional effects of the sensitivity analyses   to the charges recognized from the changes   in assumptions as of December 31,  2020   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating segment | Impairment   losses   recognized | Discount rate  growth rate  +1%                                                                                                         | Long-term  -1%                                                                                                                          | Multiples  Operating  EBITDA  11.5x                                                                                                     |\n| United States     | $  1,020                         | 188                                                                                                                                     | -                                                                                                                                       | -                                                                                                                                       |\n\nThe factors considered by the Company's management that could cause the hypothetical scenarios of the previous sensitivity analysis in the United States are, in relation to the discount rate, an independent increase of 300 bps in the industry funding cost observed as of December 31, 2020 of 4.1% or, an independent increase in the risk-free rate of 190 bps over the rate of 2.3% in such country. Nonetheless, such assumptions do not seem probable as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, except for the operating segment in the United States presented in the table above, none of the other sensitivity analyses indicated a potential impairment risk in CEMEX's operating segments. CEMEX continually monitors the evolution of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated that have presented relative goodwill impairment risk in any of the reported periods and, if the relevant economic variables and the related value in use would be negatively affected, it may result in a goodwill impairment loss in the future.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill allocated to its operating segment in the United States accounted for 76% and 78%, of CEMEX's total amount of consolidated goodwill, respectively. In connection with CEMEX's determination of value in use relative to its groups of CGUs in the United States in the reported periods, CEMEX has considered several factors, such as the historical performance of such operating segment, including the operating results in recent years, the long-term nature of CEMEX's investment, the signs of recovery in the construction industry over the last years, the significant economic barriers for new potential competitors considering the high investment required, and the lack of susceptibility of the industry to technology improvements or alternate construction products, among other factors. To improve its assurance, as mentioned above, CEMEX verified its conclusions using sensitivity analyses over Operating EBITDA multiples of recent sale transaction within the industry occurred in such country, as well as macroeconomic information regarding gross domestic product and cement consumption over the projected periods issued by the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Portland Cement Association, respectively.",

Of these incurred Issuance Costs, $38 in 2020 and $24 in 2019, corresponding to new debt instruments or the refinancing of old debt, adjusted the carrying amount of the related debt instruments and are amortized over the remaining term of each instrument, while $60 in 2020, $39 in 2019 and $51 in 2018 of such Issuance Costs, associated with the extinguished portion of the related debt, were recognized in the statement of operations in each year within 'Financial expense'. In addition, Issuance Costs pending for amortization related to extinguished debt instruments for $19 in 2020, $1 in 2019 and $4 in 2018 were also recognized in the statement of operations of each year within 'Financial expense.'\n\n## 2017 Facilities Agreement\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the Parent Company and certain subsidiaries entered into the 2017 Facilities Agreement for an amount in different currencies equivalent to $4,050 at the origination date. The proceeds were used to refinance in full the $3,680 then outstanding under the former facilities agreements and other debt repayments. All tranches under the 2017 Facilities Agreement have substantially the same terms and share the same guarantors and collateral package as other secured debt obligations of CEMEX. After the amendments to the 2017 Facilities Agreement mentioned below that became effective on October 13, 2020, all tranches under the 2017 Facilities Agreement amortize in five equal payments beginning in July 2021 and ending in July 2025, except for: (i) a tranche for the Mexican Peso equivalent of $313 amortizing in four equal payments beginning in July 2023 and ending in July 2025; and (ii) the commitments under the revolving credit which mature in July 2023.\n\nAll tranches under the 2017 Facilities Agreement have substantially the same terms, including a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR and TIIE, as applicable, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio (as defined below in the Financial Covenants section) of CEMEX, as follows:\n\n| Consolidated leverage ratio   | LIBOR / EURIBOR Applicable margin  1   | TIIE Applicable margin  1   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| > = 6.00x                     | 475 bps                                | 425 bps                     |\n| < 6.00x > = 5.50x             | 425 bps                                | 375 bps                     |\n| < 5.50x > = 5.00x             | 375 bps                                | 325 bps                     |\n| < 5.00x > = 4.50x             | 300 bps                                | 250 bps                     |\n| < 4.50x > = 4.00x             | 250 bps                                | 210 bps                     |\n| < 4.00x > = 3.50x             | 212.5 bps                              | 180 bps                     |\n| < 3.50x > = 3.00x             | 175 bps                                | 150 bps                     |\n| < 3.00x > = 2.50x             | 150 bps                                | 125 bps                     |\n| < 2.50x                       | 125 bps                                | 100 bps                     |\n\nAs part of the amendment process to the 2017 Facilities Agreement that became effective on October 13, 2020, among other aspects, CEMEX negotiated: a) the extension of $1.1 billion of maturities by three years, from 2022 to 2025 and $1.1 billion (including the extension of December 17, 2020 mentioned below) of commitments under the revolving credit facility by one year from 2022 to 2023; b) the inclusion of five sustainability-linked metrics, including reduction of net CO2 emissions per cementitious product, power consumption from green energy in cement and improvements in quarry rehabilitation and water management, among other metrics; c) redenominating $313 of previous Dollar debt under the term loans that are part of the 2017 Facilities Agreement to Mexican Pesos, and $82 to Euros; d) amending the consolidated leverage ratio, as described below in the financial covenants section; and e) amendments to incorporate Loan Market Association replacement screen rate provisions in anticipation of the discontinuation of LIBOR and potentially EURIBOR, as well as Mexican benchmark interbank rate provisions. On December 17, 2020, $136 of debt under the 2017 Facilities Agreement were further extended, of which, $43 mature in 2023 and $93 mature in 2025 in line with the October 13, 2020 amendment process.",

        "page_content": "As part of amendment process to the 2017 Facilities Agreement that became effective on May 22, 2020, among other aspects, CEMEX negotiated the modification of the financial covenants contained therein, including the leverage and coverage ratios, to levels that would ideally enable CEMEX to remain in compliance with such financial covenants notwithstanding the adverse effects arising during the COVID-19 Pandemic (note 2) and the period of gradual return to normal operations. As a result of the modifications to its financial covenants, the Company agreed to a one-time fee of $14 (35 basis points ('bps')) and adjusted the applicable margin over LIBOR, or EURIBOR, as applicable, to accommodate for the changes to the leverage limits covenant. Moreover, CEMEX agreed to certain temporary restrictions which are no longer applicable with respect to permitted capital expenditures, the extension of loans to third parties, acquisitions and/or the use of proceeds from asset sales and fundraising activities, as well as an increase from zero to 125 bps in the financial expense, depending on the corresponding applicable margin, CEMEX would be required to pay under the 2017 Facilities Agreement. CEMEX also agreed to cease share repurchases whenever and for as long as the Company fails to report a consolidated leverage ratio of 4.50x or less.\n\nAs part of the amendments to the 2017 Facilities Agreement that became effective on November 4, 2019, among other aspects, CEMEX negotiated: a) an exclusive amount of up to $500 permitted for share buy-back; b) a new allowance for disposals of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries that are no obligors under the 2017 Facilities Agreement of up to $100 per calendar year; c) amendments related to the implementation of corporate reorganizations in Mexico, Europe and TCL; and d) modifications to the calculation and limits of the consolidated coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio, as described in the Financial Covenants section below.\n\nAs part of the amendment process to the 2017 Facilities Agreement that became effective on April 2, 2019, among other aspects, CEMEX extended $1,060 of maturities by three years and made certain adjustments to its consolidated financial leverage ratio, as described below in the financial covenants section, in connection with the implementation of IFRS 16 and the neutralization of any potential effect from such adoption. In addition, CEMEX delayed the scheduled tightening of the consolidated financial leverage ratio limit by one year.\n\nThe balance of debt under the 2017 Facilities Agreement, which debtor is CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V., was originally guaranteed by CEMEX M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V. ('CEMEX M\u00e9xico'), CEMEX Concretos, S.A. de C.V., Empresas Tolteca de M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V. ('ETM'), New Sunward Holding B.V., CEMEX Espa\u00f1a, CEMEX Asia B.V., CEMEX Corp., CEMEX Africa & Middle East Investments B.V., CEMEX Finance LLC, CEMEX France Gestion (S.A.S.), CEMEX Research Group AG and CEMEX UK. In addition, the debt under these agreements (together with all other senior capital markets debt issued or guaranteed by CEMEX, and certain other preceding facilities) is also secured by a first-priority security interest in: (a) substantially all the shares of CEMEX Operaciones M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V, CEMEX Innovation Holding Ltd. and CEMEX Espa\u00f1a (the 'Collateral'); and (b) all proceeds of such Collateral. In 2019, the Parent Company merged and absorbed ETM and CEMEX M\u00e9xico, effective against third parties on February 26, 2020 and March 9, 2020, respectively. In addition, CEMEX Espa\u00f1a merged and absorbed New Sunward Holding B.V. with effects as of December 1, 2020. As a result, the merged and absorbed entities ceased to guarantee CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.'s indebtedness and the shares of CEMEX M\u00e9xico and New Sunward Holding B.V., which used to be part of the Collateral, are no longer part of it.\n\nDuring the years 2020 and 2019, under the 2017 Facilities Agreement, CEMEX was required to: a) not exceed an aggregate amount for capital expenditures of $1,500 per year, excluding certain capital expenditures, joint venture investments and acquisitions by CHP and its subsidiaries and CLH and its subsidiaries, which had a separate limit of $500 (or its equivalent) each; and b) not exceed the amount for permitted acquisitions and investments in joint ventures of $400 per year. Nonetheless, such limitations did not apply if capital expenditures or acquisitions did not exceed free cash flow generation or were funded with proceeds from equity issuances or asset disposals.\n\nIn addition to the restrictions mentioned above, and subject in each case to the permitted negotiated amounts and other exceptions, CEMEX is also subject to several negative covenants that, among other things, restrict or limit its ability to incur additional obligations, change its line of business, enter into mergers and enter into speculative derivatives transactions. Certain covenants and restrictions, such as the capital expenditure restrictions and several negative covenants, including restrictions on CEMEX's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and distributions to shareholders, among others, shall cease to apply or become less restrictive if CEMEX so elects upon CEMEX's Leverage Ratio (as defined hereinafter) for the two most recently completed quarterly testing periods being less than or equal to 3.75 times and no default under the 2017 Facilities Agreement is continuing. CEMEX cannot assure that it will be able to meet the conditions for these restrictions to cease to apply prior to the final maturity date under the 2017 Facilities Agreement. In addition, the 2017 Facilities Agreement contains events of default, some of which may occur and are outside of CEMEX's control such as expropriation, sequestration and availability of foreign exchange.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX was in compliance with such limitations and restrictions contained in the 2017 Facilities Agreement. CEMEX cannot assure that in the future it will be able to comply with such restrictive covenants and limitations. CEMEX's failure to comply with such covenants and limitations could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect CEMEX's business and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Covenants\n\nThe 2017 Facilities Agreement requires CEMEX to comply with financial ratios, which mainly include: a) the consolidated ratio of debt to Operating EBITDA (the 'Leverage Ratio'); and b) the consolidated ratio of Operating EBITDA to interest expense (the 'Coverage Ratio'). These financial ratios are calculated using the consolidated amounts under IFRS.\n\nCEMEX must comply with a Coverage Ratio and a Leverage Ratio for each period of four consecutive quarters. After the October 13, 2020 amendments, the Coverage Ratio should be equal or greater than 1.75 times for each reference period ending on December 31, 2020 through March 31, 2021; equal or greater than 2.25 times for each reference period ending on June 30, 2021 through September 30, 2021; equal or greater than 2.50 times for each reference period ending on December 31, 2021 through September 30, 2022; and equal or greater than 2.75 times for each subsequent reference period. The limits for the Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n\n| Period                                                                                              | Leverage Ratio   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| For the period ending on December 31, 2020 up to and including the period ending on March 31, 2021  | < = 6.25         |\n| For the period ending on June 30, 2021                                                              | < = 6.00         |\n| For the period ending on September 30, 2021 up to and including the period ending on March 31, 2022 | < = 5.75         |\n| For the period ending on June 30, 2022 up to and including the period ending on September 30, 2022  | < = 5.25         |\n| For the period ending on December 31, 2022 up to and including the period ending on March 31, 2023  | < = 4.75         |\n| For the period ending on June 30, 2023 and each subsequent reference period                         | < = 4.50         |\n\nLeverage Ratio: is  calculated  dividing  'Funded Debt' by pro forma Operating EBITDA for the last twelve months as of the calculation date including a permanent fixed adjustment from the adoption of IFRS 16. Funded Debt equals debt, as reported in the statement of financial position, net of cash and cash equivalents, excluding components of liability of convertible subordinated notes, plus lease liabilities, perpetual debentures and guarantees, plus or minus the fair value of derivative financial instruments, as applicable, among other adjustments for business acquisitions or disposals. Before the April 2, 2019 amendments, the calculation of Funded Debt did not include cash and cash equivalents and obligations under lease contracts.\n\nPro forma Operating EBITDA represents, Operating EBITDA for the last twelve months as of the calculation date, after IFRS 16 effects, plus the portion of Operating EBITDA referring to such twelve-month period of any significant acquisition made in the period before its consolidation in CEMEX, minus Operating EBITDA referring to such twelve-month period of any significant disposal that had already been liquidated.\n\nCoverage Ratio: is calculated by dividing pro forma Operating EBITDA by the financial expense for the last twelve months as of the calculation date, both including IFRS 16 effects. Financial expense includes coupons accrued on the perpetual debentures.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, under the 2017 Facilities Agreement, the main consolidated financial ratios were as follows:\n\n|                |             | Consolidated financial ratios  1   | Consolidated financial ratios  1   | Consolidated financial ratios  1   |\n|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                |             | 2020                               | 2019                               | 2018                               |\n| Leverage ratio | Limit       | <=6.25                             | <=5.25                             | <=4.75                             |\n|                | Calculation | 4.07                               | 4.17                               | 3.84                               |\n| Coverage ratio | Limit       | >=1.75                             | >=2.50                             | >=2.50                             |\n|                | Calculation | 3.82                               | 3.86                               | 4.41                               |\n\nCEMEX's ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by economic conditions and volatility in foreign exchange rates, as well as by overall conditions in the financial and capital markets.\n\nCEMEX will classify all of its non-current debt as current debt if: 1) as of any measurement date CEMEX fails to comply with the aforementioned financial ratios; or 2) the cross default clause that is part of the 2017 Facilities Agreement is triggered by the provisions contained therein; 3) as of any date prior to a subsequent measurement date CEMEX expects not to be in compliance with such financial ratios in the absence of: a) amendments and/or waivers covering the next succeeding 12 months; b) high probability that the violation will be cured during any agreed upon remediation period and be sustained for the next succeeding 12 months; and/or c) an agreement to refinance the relevant debt on a long-term basis. As a result of such classification of debt as current for noncompliance with the agreed upon financial ratios or, in such event, the absence of a waiver of compliance or a negotiation thereof, after certain procedures upon CEMEX's lenders' request, they would call for the acceleration of payments due under the 2017 Facilities Agreement. That scenario would have a material adverse effect on CEMEX's operating results, liquidity or financial position.",

The 2020 Convertible Notes, were subordinated to most of CEMEX's liabilities and commitments and were convertible into a fixed number of the Parent Company's ADSs at any time at the holder's election and were subject to antidilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2019, the conversion price per ADS for the 2020 Convertible Notes was $10.73 dollars. On March 13, 2020, CEMEX paid $521 as full settlement of the aggregate outstanding amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes which matured on March 15, 2020 with a minimal conversion of ADS.",

        "page_content": "## 17.3) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe book values of cash, trade receivables, other accounts receivable, trade payables, other accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as short-term debt, approximate their corresponding estimated fair values due to the revolving nature of these financial assets and liabilities in the short-term.\n\nThe estimated fair value of CEMEX's non-current debt is level 1 and level 2 and is either based on estimated market prices for such or similar instruments, considering interest rates currently available for CEMEX to negotiate debt with the same maturities, or determined by discounting future cash flows using market-based interest rates currently available to CEMEX.\n\nThe fair values determined by CEMEX for its derivative financial instruments are level 2. There is no direct measure for the risk of CEMEX or its counterparties in connection with such instruments. Therefore, the risk factors applied for CEMEX's assets and liabilities originated by the valuation of such derivatives were extrapolated from publicly available risk discounts for other public debt instruments of CEMEX or of its counterparties.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative instruments fluctuates over time and is determined by measuring the effect of future relevant economic variables according to the yield curves shown in the market as of the reporting date. These values should be analyzed in relation to the fair values of the underlying transactions and as part of CEMEX's overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The notional amounts of derivative instruments do not represent amounts of cash exchanged by the parties, and consequently, there is no direct measure of CEMEX's exposure to the use of these derivatives. The amounts exchanged are determined based on the notional amounts and other terms included in the derivative instruments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities and their respective fair values were as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | 2020             | 2020       | 2019             | 2019       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|\n|                                                                   | Carrying  amount | Fair value | Carrying  amount | Fair value |\n| Financial assets                                                  |                  |            |                  |            |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 14.2 and 17.4)            | $  3             | 3          | $  2             | 2          |\n| Other investments and non-current accounts receivable (note 14.2) | 272              | 272        | 234              | 234        |\n|                                                                   | $  275           | 275        | $  236           | 236        |\n| Financial liabilities                                             |                  |            |                  |            |\n| Long-term debt (note 17.1)                                        | $  9,160         | 9,687      | $  9,303         | 9,711      |\n| Other financial obligations (note 17.2)                           | 967              | 1,012      | 1,044            | 1,071      |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 17.4 and 18.2)            | 53               | 53         | 46               | 46         |\n|                                                                   | $  10,180        | 10,752     | $  10,393        | 10,828     |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, assets and liabilities carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position are included in the following fair value hierarchy categories (note 3.6):\n\n| 2020                                                         |    | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Assets measured at fair value                                |    |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 14.2 and 17.4)       | $  | -         | 3         | -         | 3       |\n| Investments in strategic equity securities (note 14.2)       |    | 3         | -         | -         | 3       |\n| Other investments at fair value through earnings (note 14.2) |    | -         | 23        | -         | 23      |\n|                                                              | $  | 3         | 26        | -         | 29      |\n| Liabilities measured at fair value                           |    |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 17.4 and 18.2)       | $  | -         | 53        | -         | 53      |",

Net investment hedge\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there are Dollar/Mexican peso foreign exchange forward contracts under a program that started in 2017 with a notional of up to $1,250, which can be adjusted in relation to hedged risks. During 2020, this program was adjusted and reached a notional amount of $741 with forward contracts with tenors from 1 to 18 months. For accounting purposes under IFRS, CEMEX has designated this program as a hedge of CEMEX's net investment in Mexican pesos, pursuant to which changes in fair market value of these instruments are recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity. For the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, these contracts generated gains of $53 and losses of $126 and $59, respectively, which partially offset currency translation results in each year recognized in equity generated from CEMEX's net assets denominated in Mexican pesos due to the depreciation of the peso in 2020 and the appreciation of the peso in 2019 and 2018.\n\n## II. Interest rate swap contracts\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX held interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $1,000 the fair value of which represented a liability of $44 and $35, respectively, negotiated in June 2018 to fix interest payments of existing bank loans bearing floating rates. The contracts mature in June 2023. During September 2020, CEMEX amended one of the interest rate swap contracts to reduce the weighted strike from 3.05% to 2.56% paying $14 recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of operations. For accounting purposes under IFRS, CEMEX designated these contracts as cash flow hedges, pursuant to which, changes in fair value are initially recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity and are subsequently allocated through financial expense as interest expense on the related bank loans is accrued. For the years ended in 2020 and 2019, changes in fair value of these contracts generated losses of $9 and losses of $26, respectively, recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nDuring October 2020, CEMEX negotiated interest rate swaps to fix interest payments of existing bank loans referenced to Mexican Peso floating rates and will mature in November 2023. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX held a notional amount of $334 the fair value of which represented a liability of $3. CEMEX designated these contracts as cash flow hedges, pursuant to which, changes in fair value are initially recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity and are subsequently allocated through financial expense as interest expense on the related bank loans is accrued. For the year ended in 2020 changes in fair value of these contracts generated losses of $3 recognized in other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2018, CEMEX had an interest rate swap maturing in September 2022 associated with an agreement entered by CEMEX for the acquisition of electric energy in Mexico, the fair value of which represented assets of $11. Pursuant to this instrument, during the tenure of the swap and based on its notional amount, CEMEX receives fixed rate of 5.4% and pays LIBOR. Changes in the fair value of this interest rate swap generated losses of $6 in 2018, recognized in the income statement for each period. During 2019, CEMEX unwound and settled its interest rate swap.\n\n## III. Equity forwards on third party shares\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX maintained equity forward contracts with cash settlement in March 2021 and March 2020, respectively, over the price of 4.7 million shares of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua, S.A.B. de C.V. in 2020 and 13.9 million in 2019. During 2020 and 2019, CEMEX early settled a portion of these contracts for 9.2 and 6.9 million shares, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these instruments and early settlement effects generated gains of $1 in 2020, gains of $2 in 2019 and gains of $26 in 2018 recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the income statement.\n\n## IV. Fuel price hedging\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX maintained forward and option contracts negotiated to hedge the price of certain fuels, primarily diesel and gas, in several operations for aggregate notional amounts of $128 and $96, respectively, with an estimated aggregate fair value representing assets of $5 in 2020 and assets of $1 in 2019. By means of these contracts, for its own consumption only, CEMEX fixed the price of these fuels over certain volumes representing a portion of the estimated consumption of such fuels in several operations. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of diesel or gas consumption, and as such, changes in fair value are recognized temporarily through other comprehensive income and are recycled to operating expenses as the related fuel volumes are consumed. For the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, changes in fair value of these contracts recognized in other comprehensive income represented gains of $7, gains of $15 and losses of $35, respectively.\n\n## Other derivative financial instruments negotiated during the periods\n\nDuring 2020, CEMEX negotiated Dollar/Peso, Dollar/Euro and Dollar/British Pound foreign exchange forward contracts to sell Dollars and Pesos and buy Euro and British Pounds, negotiated in connection with the voluntary prepayment and currency exchanges under the 2017 Facilities Agreement, for a combined notional amount of $397. For the year 2020, the aggregate results from positions entered and settled, generated losses of $15 recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statements of operation. Additionally, during 2020, CEMEX negotiated Dollar/Euro foreign exchange forward contracts to sell Dollars and buy Euro, negotiated in connection with the redemption of the 4.625% April 2024 Notes. For the year 2020, the aggregate results of these instruments from positions entered and settled, generated gains of $3, recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of operations.\n\nMoreover, in connection with the proceeds from the sale of certain assets in the United Kingdom (note 5.2), the Company negotiated British Pound/Euro foreign exchange forward contracts to sell British Pounds and buy Euro for a notional amount of $186. CEMEX settled such derivatives on August 5, 2020. During the year 2020, changes in the fair value of these instruments and their settlement generated gains of $9 recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of operations.\n\n## 17.5) RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nEnterprise risks may arise from any of the following situations: i) the potential change in the value of assets owned or reasonably anticipated to be owned, ii) the potential change in value of liabilities incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, iii) the potential change in value of services provided, purchase or reasonably anticipated to be provided or purchased in the ordinary course of business, iv) the potential change in the value of assets, services, inputs, products or commodities owned, produced, manufactured, processed, merchandised, leased or sell or reasonably anticipated to be owned, produced, manufactured, processed, merchandised, leased or sold in the ordinary course of business, or v) any potential change in the value arising from interest rate or foreign exchange rate exposures arising from current or anticipated assets or liabilities.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, CEMEX is exposed to commodities risk, including the exposure from inputs such as fuel, coal, petcoke, fly-ash, gypsum and other industrial materials which are commonly used by CEMEX in the production process, and expose CEMEX to variations in prices of the underlying commodities. To manage this and other risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and liquidity risk, considering the guidelines set forth by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, which represent CEMEX's risk management framework and that are supervised by several Committees, CEMEX's management establishes specific policies that determine strategies oriented to obtain natural hedges to the extent possible, such as avoiding customer concentration on a determined market or aligning the currencies portfolio in which CEMEX incurred its debt, with those in which CEMEX generates its cash flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, these strategies are sometimes complemented with the use of derivative financial instruments as mentioned in note 17.4, such as the commodity forward contracts on fuels negotiated to fix the price of these underlying commodities.\n\nThe main risk categories are mentioned below:",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss faced by CEMEX if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument does not meet its contractual obligations and originates mainly from trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the balance of financial assets. Management has developed policies for the authorization of credit to customers. Exposure to credit risk is monitored constantly according to the payment behavior of debtors. Credit is assigned on a customer-by-customer basis and is subject to assessments which consider the customers' payment capacity, as well as past behavior regarding due dates, balances past due and delinquent accounts. In cases deemed necessary, CEMEX's management requires guarantees from its customers and financial counterparties regarding financial assets.\n\nThe Company's management has established a policy of low risk tolerance which analyzes the creditworthiness of each new client individually before offering the general conditions of payment terms and delivery. The review includes external ratings, when references are available, and in some cases bank references. Thresholds of purchase limits are established for each client, which represent the maximum purchase amounts that require different levels of approval. Customers that do not meet the levels of solvency requirements imposed by CEMEX can only carry out transactions by paying cash in advance. As of December 31, 2020, considering CEMEX's best estimate of potential expected losses based on the ECL model developed by CEMEX (note 10), the allowance for expected credit losses was $121.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates, which only affects CEMEX's results if the fixed-rate long-term debt is measured at fair value. All of CEMEX's fixed-rate long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and therefore is not subject to interest rate risk. CEMEX's accounting exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates, which, if such rates were to increase, may adversely affect its financing cost and the results for the period.\n\nNonetheless, it is not economically efficient to concentrate on fixed rates at a high point when the interest rates market expects a downward trend. That is, there is an opportunity cost for continuing to pay a determined fixed interest rate when the market rates have decreased, and the entity may obtain improved interest rate conditions in a new loan or debt issuance. CEMEX manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to reduce its interest costs. CEMEX could renegotiate the conditions or repurchase the debt, particularly when the net present value of the estimated future benefits from the interest rate reduction are expected to exceed the cost and commissions that would have to be paid in such renegotiation or repurchase of debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 17% and 22%, respectively, of CEMEX's long-term debt was denominated in floating rates at a weighted-average interest rate of LIBOR plus 294 basis points in 2020 and 285 basis points in 2019. These figures reflect the effect of interest rate swaps held by CEMEX during 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, if interest rates at that date had been 0.5% higher, with all other variables held constant, CEMEX's net income for 2020 and 2019 would have reduced by $17 and $19, respectively, because of higher interest expense on variable rate denominated debt. This analysis does not include the effect of interest rate swaps held by CEMEX during 2020 and 2019.\n\nA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as the 'IBOR reform'). CEMEX has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. There is uncertainty over the timing and the methods of transition in some jurisdictions in which CEMEX operates. The Company anticipates that the IBOR reform will imply adjustments to its risk management and hedge accounting practices. Nonetheless, as mentioned in note 17.1 as part of the October 13 amendments to the 2017 Facilities Agreements, to ease this transition, CEMEX included amendments to incorporate Loan Market Association replacement screen rate provisions in anticipation of the discontinuation of LIBOR and potentially EURIBOR.\n\nCEMEX's respective risk management committee monitors and manages the Company's transition to alternative rates. The committee evaluates the extent to which contracts reference IBOR cash flows, whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform with counterparties. The committee reports to the Parent Company's Board of Directors quarterly and collaborates with other business functions as needed. It provides periodic reports to management of interest rate risk and risks arising from IBOR reform.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. CEMEX's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to its operating activities. Due to its geographic diversification, CEMEX's revenues and costs are generated and settled in various countries and in different currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 21% of CEMEX's net sales, before eliminations resulting from consolidation, were generated in Mexico, 29% in the United States, 5% in the United Kingdom, 6% in France, 4% in Germany, 2% in Spain, 15% in the Rest of EMEAA region, 3% in Colombia, 1% in Panama, 2% in Dominican Republic, 2% in Caribbean TCL, 4% in the Rest of South, Central America and the Caribbean region, and 6% in CEMEX's other operations.\n\nForeign exchange results incurred through monetary assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Exchange fluctuations associated with foreign currency indebtedness directly related to the acquisition of foreign entities and exchange fluctuations in related parties' long-term balances denominated in foreign currency that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future, are recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding from the sensitivity analysis the impact of translating the net assets denominated in currencies different from CEMEX's presentation currency, considering a hypothetic 10% strengthening of the dollar against the Mexican peso, with all other variables held constant, CEMEX's net income for 2020 and 2019 would have decreased by $87 and $76, respectively, as a result of higher foreign exchange losses on CEMEX's dollar-denominated net monetary liabilities held in consolidated entities with other functional currencies. Conversely, a hypothetic 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso would have the opposite effect.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 65% of CEMEX's financial debt was Dollar-denominated, 23% was Euro-denominated, 4% was Pound-denominated, 4% was Mexican peso-denominated, 2% was Philippine peso-denominated and 2% was in other currencies. Therefore, CEMEX had a foreign currency exposure arising mainly from the Dollar-denominated and Euro-denominated financial debt versus the several currencies in which CEMEX's revenues are settled in most countries in which it operates. The amounts of Pound-denominated financial debt and Philippine peso-denominated financial debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020, are closely related to the amount of revenues generated in such currencies and/or, in the case of the Euro-denominated financial debt, the amount of CEMEX's net assets denominated in such currencies; therefore, CEMEX considers that the foreign currency risk related to these amounts of debt is low. Nonetheless, CEMEX cannot guarantee that it will generate sufficient revenues in dollars, euros, pounds and Philippine pesos from its operations to service these obligations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX had not implemented any derivative financing hedging strategy to address this foreign currency risk. Nonetheless, CEMEX may negotiate derivative financing hedging strategies in the future if either of its debt portfolio currency mix, interest rate mix, market conditions and/or expectations changes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX's consolidated net monetary assets (liabilities) by currency are as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2020     | 2020          | 2020    | 2020   | 2020      | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|\n|                                   | Mexico   | United States | EMEAA   | SCA&C  | Others  1 | Total    |\n| Monetary assets                   | $  856   | 550           | 1,452   | 240    | 419       | 3,517    |\n| Monetary liabilities              | 1,420    | 2,480         | 3,534   | 680    | 9,625     | 17,739   |\n| Net monetary assets (liabilities) | $  (564) | (1,930)       | (2,082) | (440)  | (9,206)   | (14,222) |\n| Out of which:                     |          |               |         |        |           |          |\n| Dollars                           | $  (161) | (1,930)       | 17      | (37)   | (6,065)   | (8,176)  |\n| Pesos                             | (403)    | -             | -       | -      | (87)      | (490)    |\n| Euros                             | -        | -             | (743)   | -      | (2,451)   | (3,194)  |\n| Pounds                            | -        | -             | (1,174) | -      | 26        | (1,148)  |\n| Other currencies                  | -        | -             | (182)   | (403)  | (629)     | (1,214)  |\n|                                   | $  (564) | (1,930)       | (2,082) | (440)  | (9,206)   | (14,222) |",

When the dollar appreciates, the value of these net assets denominated in other currencies decreases in terms of Dollars, generating negative foreign currency translation and reducing stockholders' equity. Conversely, when the dollar depreciates, the value of such net assets denominated in other currencies would increase in terms of dollars generating the opposite effect. CEMEX has implemented a Dollar/Mexican peso foreign exchange forward contracts program to hedge foreign currency translation in connection with its net assets denominated in pesos (note 17.4).\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in the market price of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.'s and/or third party's shares. As described in note 17.4, considering specific objectives, CEMEX has negotiated equity forward contracts on third-party shares. Under these equity derivative instruments, there is a direct relationship from the change in the fair value of the derivative with the change in price of the underlying share. All changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized in the income statement as part of 'Financial income and other items, net.' During the reported periods effects were not significant.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the potential change in the fair value of CEMEX's forward contracts in GCC shares that would result from a hypothetical, instantaneous decrease of 10% in the market price of GCC shares in dollars, with all other variables held constant, CEMEX's net income would have reduced by $3 in 2020 and $7 in 2019, because of additional negative changes in fair value associated with these forward contracts. A 10% hypothetical increase in the price of GCC shares would have generated approximately the opposite effect.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that CEMEX will not have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations. In addition to cash flows provided by its operating activities, to meet CEMEX's overall liquidity needs for operations, servicing debt and funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, CEMEX relies on cost-cutting and operating improvements to optimize capacity utilization and maximize profitability, as well as borrowing under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings, and proceeds from asset sales. CEMEX is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, prices and currency controls, interest rates, inflation, governmental spending, social instability and other political, economic and/or social developments in the countries in which it operates, any one of which may materially affect CEMEX's results and reduce cash from operations. The maturities of CEMEX's contractual obligations are included in note 24.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, current liabilities, which included $1,063 of current debt and other financial obligations, exceed current assets by $1,117. It is noted that as part of its operating strategy implemented by management, the Company operates with a negative working capital balance. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CEMEX generated net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1,578. The Company's management considers that CEMEX will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the following twelve months to meet its current obligations and trusts in its proven capacity to continually refinance and replace its current obligations, which will enable CEMEX to meet any liquidity risk in the short-term. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, CEMEX has committed lines of credit under the revolving credit facility in its 2017 Facilities Agreement for a total amount of $1,121.",

In addition, the United Kingdom Government confirmed on November 25, 2020, with effect from February 2030 onwards, Retail Prices Index ('RPI') will be aligned with Consumer Prices Index ('CPI'). The RPI is used to set pension increase assumptions for the United Kingdom pension plans. As a result of this change, in 2020, CEMEX had an increase in its United Kingdom pension liabilities of $54. In 2019, such net actuarial losses were also mainly driven by a general decrease in the discount rates applicable to the calculation of the benefits' obligations mainly in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Mexico, as market interest rates decrease globally in 2019 as compared to 2018, partially offset by actual returns in plan assets higher than estimated in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2018, net actuarial gains due to financial assumptions were mainly generated by a general increase in the discounts rates applied for the calculation of the pension benefit obligations in the United Kingdom, Germany, United States and Mexico, among others, resulting from the increase in market interest rates after several years in which such rates reached historically low levels.",

        "page_content": "In some countries, CEMEX has established health care benefits for retired personnel limited to a certain number of years after retirement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the projected benefits obligation related to these benefits was $78 and $62, respectively, included within other benefits liability. The medical inflation rates used to determine the projected benefits obligation of these benefits in 2020 and 2019 for Mexico were 8% in both years, for Puerto Rico 6.4% and 6.3%, respectively, for the United Kingdom were 6.5% in both years and for TCL were 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\n\n## Significant events of settlements or curtailments related to employees' pension benefits and other post-employment benefits during the reported periods\n\nDuring 2020, in connection with the divestiture of Kosmos' assets in the United States (note 5.1), CEMEX recognized a curtailment gain of $1 related to its medical plan. Moreover, in France, CEMEX changed certain formulas of the pension benefits resulting in a past service gain of $2. In addition, in Mexico, CEMEX changed some postretirement benefits which resulted in an expense for past services of $1 in 2020. These effects were recognized in the income statement for the year.\n\nDuring 2019, CEMEX in France closed two legal entities resulting in a curtailment gain of $3, which were recognized in the income statement for the period. There were no significant events during 2018.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of pension and other post-employment benefits\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, CEMEX performed sensitivity analyses on the most significant assumptions that affect the PBO, considering reasonable independent changes of plus or minus 50 basis points in each of these assumptions. The increase (decrease) that would have resulted in the PBO of pensions and other post-employment benefits as of December 31, 2020 are shown below:\n\n|                                   | Pensions   | Pensions   | Other benefits   | Other benefits   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| Assumptions:                      | +50 bps    | -50 bps    | +50 bps          | -50 bps          | +50 bps | -50 bps |\n| Discount Rate Sensitivity         | $  (202)   | 228        | (5)              | 6                | (207)   | 234     |\n| Salary Increase Rate Sensitivity  | 7          | (7)        | 1                | -                | 8       | (7)     |\n| Pension Increase Rate Sensitivity | 146        | (128)      | -                | -                | 146     | (128)   |\n\n## Multiemployer defined benefit pension plans\n\nIn addition to the Company's sponsored plans, certain union employees in the United States and the United Kingdom are covered under multiemployer defined benefit plans administered by their unions. The Company's funding arrangements, rate of contributions and funding requirements were made in accordance with the contractual multiemployer agreements. The combined amounts contributed to the multiemployer plans were $56 in 2020, $64 in 2019 and $65 in 2018. The Company expects to contribute approximately $58 to the multiemployer plans in 2021.\n\nIn addition to the funding described in the preceding paragraph, CEMEX negotiated with a union managing a multiemployer plan in the United States the change of the plan from defined benefit to defined contribution beginning on September 29, 2019. This change generated a one-time settlement obligation of $24 recognized in the income statement in 2019 as part of 'Other expenses, net', against an accrued liability. Payments are expected to be made over the next 20 years though lump sum payment is allowable.",

Based on the same forecasts of future cash flows and operating results used by CEMEX's management to allocate resources and evaluate performance in the countries in which CEMEX operates, along with the implementation of feasible tax strategies, CEMEX believes that it will recover the balance of its tax loss carryforwards that have been recognized before their expiration. In addition, CEMEX concluded that, the deferred tax liabilities that were considered in the analysis of recoverability of its deferred tax assets will reverse in the same period and tax jurisdiction of the related recognized deferred tax assets. Moreover, a certain amount of CEMEX's deferred tax assets refers to operating segments and tax jurisdictions in which CEMEX is currently generating taxable income or in which, according to CEMEX's management cash flow projections, will generate taxable income in the relevant periods before the expiration of the deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Parent Company does not recognize a deferred income tax liability related to its investments in subsidiaries considering that CEMEX controls the reversal of the temporary differences arising from these investments and management is satisfied that such temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of December 31, 2020, the tax returns submitted by some subsidiaries of CEMEX located in several countries are under review by the respective tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. CEMEX cannot anticipate if such reviews will result in new tax assessments, which would, should any arise, be appropriately disclosed and/or recognized in the financial statements. A summary of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:\n\n|                                                                       | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Balance of tax positions at beginning of the period                   | $  28  | 44     | 80     |\n| Adoption effects of IFRIC 23 credited to retained earnings (note 3.1) | -      | (6)    | -      |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior periods                          | -      | -      | 1      |\n| Additions for tax positions of current period                         | 3      | 4      | 6      |\n| Reductions for tax positions related to prior periods and other items | (1)    | (13)   | (2)    |\n| Settlements and reclassifications                                     | (3)    | -      | (7)    |\n| Expiration of the statute of limitations                              | (2)    | (2)    | (32)   |\n| Foreign currency translation effects                                  | 2      | 1      | (2)    |\n| Balance of tax positions at end of the period                         | $  27  | 28     | 44     |\n\nTax examinations can involve complex issues, and the resolution of issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Although CEMEX believes its estimates of the total unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, uncertainties regarding the final determination of income tax audit settlements and any related litigation could affect the amount of total unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. It is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to uncertain tax positions, as finalizing audits with the income tax authorities may involve formal administrative and legal proceedings. Accordingly, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected changes to the total unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months, although any settlements or statute of limitations expirations may result in a significant increase or decrease in the total unrecognized tax benefits, including those positions related to tax examinations being currently conducted.\n\n## Significant tax proceedings\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's most significant tax proceedings are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The tax authorities in Spain have challenged part of the tax loss carryforwards reported by CEMEX Espa\u00f1a covering the tax years from and including 2006 to 2009. During 2014, the tax authorities in Spain notified CEMEX Espa\u00f1a of fines in the aggregate amount of $557. CEMEX Espa\u00f1a filed appeals against such resolution. On September 20, 2017, CEMEX Espa\u00f1a was notified about an adverse resolution to such appeals. CEMEX Espa\u00f1a challenged this decision and applied for the suspension of the payment before the National Court ( Audiencia Nacional ) until the case is finally resolved. On November 6, 2018 CEMEX Espa\u00f1a obtained a favorable resolution to this request from the National Court through the pledge of certain fixed assets. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX believes an adverse resolution in this proceeding is not probable and no accruals have been created in connection with this proceeding. Nonetheless, it is difficult to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result, and the appeals that CEMEX Espa\u00f1a has filed could take an extended amount of time to be resolved, but if adversely resolved, this proceeding could have a material adverse impact on CEMEX's results of operations, liquidity or financial position.\n- \u00b7 On April 6, 2018, CEMEX Colombia received a special proceeding from the Colombian Tax Authority (the 'Tax Authority'), where certain deductions included in the 2012 income tax return were rejected. The Tax Authority assessed an increase in the income tax payable by CEMEX Colombia and imposed an inaccuracy penalty for amounts in Colombian pesos equivalent to $36 of income tax and $36 of penalty. On June 22, 2018, CEMEX Colombia filed a response to the special proceeding within the legal term. On December 28, 2018, CEMEX Colombia received an official review settlement ratifying the rejected deductible items and amounts. CEMEX Colombia filed a reconsideration request on February 21, 2019. On January 8, 2020, CEMEX Colombia was notified that, in response to the appeal filed by it, the Tax Authority had confirmed its assessment that CEMEX Colombia is required to pay increased taxes and corresponding penalties, as previously notified on April 6, 2018. On July 1, 2020, CEMEX Colombia filed an appeal against the aforementioned resolution in the Administrative Court of Cundinamarca. If the proceeding is adversely resolved in the final stage, CEMEX Colombia must pay the amounts determined in the official settlement plus interest accrued on the amount of the income tax adjustment until the payment date. As of December 31, 2020, in this stage of the proceeding, CEMEX considers that an adverse resolution in this proceeding after conclusion of all available defense procedures is not probable, however, it is difficult to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result in the proceeding; but if adversely resolved, CEMEX believes this proceeding could have a material adverse impact on the operating results, liquidity or financial position of CEMEX.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In September 2012, the Tax Authority requested CEMEX Colombia to amend its income tax return for the year 2011 in connection with several deductible expenses including the amortization of goodwill. CEMEX Colombia rejected the arguments of the ordinary request and filed a motion requesting the case to be closed. The 2011 income tax return was under audit of the Tax Authority from August 2013 until September 5, 2018, when CEMEX Colombia was notified of a special requirement in which the Tax Authority rejects certain deductions included in such income tax return of the year 2011 and determined an increase in the income tax payable and imposed a penalty for amounts in Colombian pesos equivalent to $25 of income tax and $25 of penalty. CEMEX Colombia filed a response to the special requirement on November 30, 2018 and the Tax Authority notified the official review liquidation on May 15, 2019, maintaining the claims of the special requirement; therefore, CEMEX Colombia filed an appeal within the legal term on July 11, 2019. On July 6, 2020, CEMEX Colombia was notified about a resolution confirming the official liquidation. On October 22, 2020, CEMEX Colombia filed an appeal against such resolution in the Administrative Court of Cundinamarca. If the proceeding is adversely resolved in its final stage, CEMEX Colombia would have to pay the amounts determined in the official settlement plus interest accrued on the amount of the income tax adjustment until the date of payment. As of December 31, 2020, in this stage of the proceeding, CEMEX considers that an adverse resolution in this proceeding after conclusion of all available defense procedures is not probable, however, it is difficult to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result in the proceeding; but if adversely resolved, CEMEX believes this proceeding could have a material adverse impact on the operating results, liquidity or financial position of CEMEX.\n- \u00b7 In April 2011, the Tax Authority notified CEMEX Colombia of a special proceeding rejecting certain deductions taken by CEMEX Colombia in its 2009 tax return considering they are not linked to direct revenues recorded in the same fiscal year and assessed an increase in taxes to be paid by CEMEX Colombia and imposed a penalty for amounts in Colombian pesos equivalent to $27 of income tax and $27 of penalty, considering changes in law that reduced the original penalty. After several appeals of CEMEX Colombia to the Colombian Tax Authority's special proceeding in the applicable courts in which CEMEX Colombia obtained negative resolutions in each case over the years, in July 2014, CEMEX Colombia filed an appeal against this resolution before the Colombian State Council ( Consejo de Estado ). On December 4, 2020, CEMEX Colombia received a last instance favorable resolution from the Colombian State Council on November 26, 2020. Appeals or other resources against this resolution are not applicable. Accordingly, CEMEX Colombia will not have to pay any additional taxes, penalties or interest in connection with the 2009 tax year.\n\n## 21) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars based on IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates ('IAS 21'), while the reporting currency of the Parent Company is the Mexican Peso. As a result, for the consolidated entity, transactions of common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings are translated and accrued using historical exchange rates of the dates in which the transactions occurred. As a result, although the amounts of total non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements and total stockholders' equity of the Parent Company are the same, IAS 21 methodology results in differences between line-by-line items within CEMEX's controlling interest and the Parent Company's stockholders' equity. The official stockholders' equity for statutory purposes is that of the Parent Company as expressed in Mexican pesos. As of December 31, 2020, the line-by-line reconciliation between CEMEX's controlling interest, as reported using the dollar as presentation currency, and the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, using a convenience translation of the balances in pesos translated using the exchange rate of 19.89 pesos per dollar as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\n\n|                                                | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                | Consolidated              | Parent   Company          |\n| Common stock and additional paid-in capital  1 | $  7,893                  | 5,403                     |\n| Other equity reserves  1, 2                    | (2,453)                   | 974                       |\n| Retained earnings  2                           | 2,635                     | 1,698                     |\n| Total controlling interest                     | $  8,075                  | 8,075                     |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, stockholders' equity excludes investments in CPOs of the Parent Company held by subsidiaries of $11 (20,541,277 CPOs) and $8 (20,541,277 CPOs), respectively, which were eliminated within 'Other equity reserves.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, non-controlling interest in equity amounted to $428 and $1,060, respectively. In addition, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, non-controlling interests in consolidated net income were $21, $36 and $42, respectively. These non-controlling interests arise mainly from the following CEMEX's subsidiaries:\n\n- \u00b7 In February 2017, CEMEX acquired a controlling interest in TCL, whose shares trade in the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there is a non-controlling interest in TCL of 30.17% of its common shares (see note 5.3 for certain relevant condensed financial information).\n- \u00b7 In July 2016, CHP, a then indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CEMEX Espa\u00f1a, closed its initial offering of 2,337,927,954 common shares, or 45% of CHP's common shares. Pursuant to the repurchase of CHP's shares in the market during 2019, CEMEX's reduced the non-controlling interest in CHP from 45% in 2018 to 33.22% of CHP's outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2019. Furthermore, CEMEX's reduced the non-controlling interest in CHP from 33.22% in 2019 to 22.16% as of December 31, 2020 of CHP's outstanding common shares due to the results of a public stock rights offering. CHP's assets consist primarily of CEMEX's cement manufacturing assets in the Philippines (see note 5.3 for certain relevant condensed financial information).\n- \u00b7 In November 2012, pursuant to a public offering in Colombia and an international private placement, CLH, a direct subsidiary of CEMEX Espa\u00f1a, concluded its initial offering of common shares. CLH's assets include substantially all of CEMEX's assets in Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and until September 27, 2018 the operations in Brazil (note 5.2). On November 9, 2020, initiated the acceptance period of a public Share Tender Offer by CEMEX Espa\u00f1a for any and all outstanding ordinary shares of CLH. On December 18, 2020, CEMEX Espa\u00f1a settled $103 and increased its ownership in CLH by acquiring 108,337,613 shares of CLH. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there is a non-controlling interest in CLH of 7.63% and 26.83%, respectively, of CLH's outstanding common shares, excluding shares held in treasury (see note 5.3 for certain relevant condensed financial information of CLH's main subsidiaries).\n\n## Perpetual debentures\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the line item 'Non-controlling interest and perpetual debentures' included $449 and $443, respectively, representing the notional amounts of perpetual debentures, which exclude any perpetual debentures held by subsidiaries.\n\nCoupon payments on the perpetual debentures were included within 'Other equity reserves' and amounted to $24 in 2020, $29 in 2019 and $29 in 2018, excluding in all the periods the coupons accrued by perpetual debentures held by subsidiaries.\n\nCEMEX's perpetual debentures have no fixed maturity date and there are no contractual obligations for CEMEX to exchange any series of its outstanding perpetual debentures for financial assets or financial liabilities. As a result, these debentures, issued entirely by Special Purpose Vehicles ('SPVs'), qualify as equity instruments and are classified within non-controlling interest, as they were issued by consolidated entities. In addition, subject to certain conditions, CEMEX has the unilateral right to defer indefinitely the payment of interest due on the debentures. The classification of the debentures as equity instruments was made under applicable IFRS. The different SPVs were established solely for purposes of issuing the perpetual debentures and were included in CEMEX's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the detail of CEMEX's perpetual debentures, excluding the perpetual debentures held by subsidiaries, was as follows:\n\n| Issuer                    | Issuance date   | 2020  Nominal amount   | 2019  Nominal amount   | Repurchase option   | Interest rate   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| C10-EUR Capital (SPV) Ltd | May 2007        | \u20ac 64                   | \u20ac 64                   | Tenth anniversary   | EURIBOR  +4.79% |\n| C8 Capital (SPV) Ltd      | February 2007   | $135                   | $135                   | Eighth anniversary  | LIBOR  +4.40%   |\n| C5 Capital (SPV) Ltd      | December 2006   | $61                    | $61                    | Fifth anniversary   | LIBOR  +4.277%  |\n| C10 Capital (SPV) Ltd     | December 2006   | $175                   | $175                   | Tenth anniversary   | LIBOR  +4.71%   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 22) EXECUTIVE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nCEMEX has long-term restricted share-based compensation programs providing for the grant of the CEMEX's CPOs to a group of eligible executives, pursuant to which, according to CEMEX's election, either new CPOs are issued, or CEMEX provides funds to the administration trust owned by the executives for the purchase of a portion or all of the required CPOs in the market for delivery to such executives under each annual program over a service period of four years (the 'Ordinary Program'). The Parent Company's CPOs of the annual grant (25% of each annual Ordinary Program) are placed at the beginning of the service period in the executives' accounts to comply with a one-year restriction on sale. Under the Ordinary Programs, the Parent Company provided funds to a broker for the purchase of 83.8 million CPOs in 2020 on behalf and for delivery to the eligible executives and issued new shares for 27.4 million CPOs in 2019 and 49.3 million CPOs in 2018, that were subscribed and pending for payment in the Parent Company's treasury and in addition, 21.2 million CPOs in 2019, net of taxes settled in cash, required for delivery were acquired by the executives' trust in the market on behalf of such executives. As of December 31, 2020, there are 248.4 million CPOs associated with these annual programs that are required for delivery in the following years as the executives render services.\n\nBeginning in 2017, with the approval of the Parent Company's Board of Directors, for a group of key executives, the conditions of the program were modified for new awards by reducing the service period from four to three years and implementing tri-annual internal and external performance metrics, which depending on their weighted achievement, may result in a final payment of the Parent Company's CPOs at the end of the third year between 0% and 200% of the target for each annual program (the 'key executives program'). During 2020 and 2019, no CPOs of the Parent Company were issued or delivered under the key executives' program.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2013, most of those eligible executives belonging to the operations of CLH and subsidiaries ceased to receive Parent Company's CPOs and instead started receiving shares of CLH, significantly sharing the same conditions of CEMEX's plan also over a service period of four years. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, CLH physically delivered 1,383,518 shares, 393,855 shares and 258,511 shares, respectively, corresponding to the vested portion of prior years' grants, which were subscribed and held in CLH's treasury. As of December 31, 2020, there are 2,895,944 shares of CLH associated with these annual programs that are expected to be delivered in the following years as the executives render services.\n\nIn addition, beginning in 2018, those eligible executives belonging to the operations of CHP and subsidiaries ceased to receive Parent Company's CPOs and instead started receiving shares of CHP, significantly sharing the same conditions of CEMEX's plan. During 2020 and 2019, CHP provided funds to a broker for the purchase of 11,546,350 and 4,961,130 CHP's shares in the market, respectively, on behalf and for delivery to the eligible executives.\n\nThe combined compensation expense related to the programs described above as determined considering the fair value of the awards at the date of grant in 2020, 2019 and 2018, was recognized in the operating results against other equity reserves or a cash outflow, as applicable, and amounted to $29, $32 and $34, respectively, including in 2019 and 2018 the cost of CEMEX's CPOs and the CHP's shares, as correspond, acquired in the market on behalf of the executives. The weighted-average price per CEMEX CPO granted during the period was determined in pesos and was equivalent to $0.3379 dollars in 2020, $0.6263 dollars in 2019 and $0.7067 dollars in 2018. Moreover, the weighted-average price per CLH share granted during the period as determined in Colombian pesos was equivalent to $0.72 dollars in 2020, $1.31 dollars in 2019 and $2.14 dollars in 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no options or commitments to make payments in cash to the executives based on changes in the market price of the Parent Company's CPO, CLH's shares and/or CHP's shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 23) EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company (the numerator) by the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Shares that would be issued depending only on the passage of time should be included in the determination of the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share should reflect in both the numerator and denominator the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, to the extent that such assumption would lead to a reduction in basic earnings per share or an increase in basic loss per share. Otherwise, the effects of potential shares are not considered because they generate antidilution.\n\nThe amounts considered for calculations of earnings per share in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                               | 2020        | 2019       | 2018       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Denominator (thousands of shares)                                                             |             |            |            |\n| Weighted-average number of shares outstanding  1                                              | 44,125,288  | 45,393,602 | 45,569,180 |\n| Capitalization of retained earnings  1                                                        | -           | -          | -          |\n| Effect of dilutive instruments - mandatorily convertible securities (note 17.2)  2            | -           | -          | 708,153    |\n| Weighted-average number of shares - basic                                                     | 44,125,288  | 45,393,602 | 46,277,333 |\n| Effect of dilutive instruments - share-based compensation (note 22)  2                        | 745,163     | 470,985    | 316,970    |\n| Effect of potentially dilutive instruments - optionally convertible securities (note 17.2)  2 | -           | 1,457,554  | 1,420,437  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares - diluted                                                   | 44,870,451  | 47,322,141 | 48,014,740 |\n| Numerator                                                                                     |             |            |            |\n| Net income (loss) from continuing operations                                                  | $  (1,326)  | 91         | 493        |\n| Less: non-controlling interest net income (loss)                                              | 21          | 36         | 42         |\n| Controlling interest net income (loss) from continuing operations                             | (1,347)     | 55         | 451        |\n| Plus: after tax interest expense on mandatorily convertible securities                        | -           | 1          | 3          |\n| Controlling interest net income (loss) from continuing operations - for basic earnings        |             |            |            |\n| per share calculations                                                                        | (1,347)     | 56         | 454        |\n| Plus: after tax interest expense on optionally convertible securities                         | 4           | 18         | 23         |\n| Controlling interest net income (loss) from continuing operations - for diluted earnings      |             |            |            |\n| per share calculations                                                                        | $  (1,343)  | 74         | 477        |\n| Net income (loss) from discontinued operations                                                | $  (120)    | 88         | 77         |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                      |             |            |            |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings (loss) per share                                          | $  (0.0332) | 0.0031     | 0.0114     |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations               | (0.0305)    | 0.0012     | 0.0098     |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations             | (0.0027)    | 0.0019     | 0.0016     |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings per share  3                                            |             |            |            |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings (loss) per share                                        | $  (0.0332) | 0.0031     | 0.0114     |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations             | (0.0305)    | 0.0012     | 0.0098     |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations           | (0.0027)    | 0.0019     | 0.0016     |",

Future nominal payments for energy were estimated for all contractual commitments based on an aggregate average expected consumption per year using the future prices of energy established in the contracts for each period. Future payments also include CEMEX's commitments for the purchase of fuel.\n\n## 24.2) OTHER COMMITMENTS\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CEMEX was party to other commitments for several purposes, including the purchase of fuel and energy, the estimated future cash flows over maturity of which are presented in note 24.1. A description of the most significant contracts is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Beginning in April 2016, in connection with the Ventika S.A.P.I. de C.V. and the Ventika II S.A.P.I. de C.V. wind farms (jointly 'Ventikas') located in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon with a combined generation capacity of 252 Megawatts ('MW'), CEMEX agreed to acquire a portion of the energy generated by Ventikas for its overall electricity needs in Mexico for a period of 20 years. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $24 (unaudited) if CEMEX receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, energy supply from wind is variable in nature and final amounts are determined considering the final MW per hour ('MWh') effectively received at the agreed prices per unit.\n- \u00b7 On July 27, 2012, CEMEX signed a 10-year strategic agreement with International Business Machines Corporation ('IBM') pursuant to which IBM provides, among others, data processing services (back office) in finance, accounting and human resources; as well as Information Technology ('IT') infrastructure services, support and maintenance of IT applications in the countries in which CEMEX operates.\n- \u00b7 Beginning in February 2010, for its overall electricity needs in Mexico CEMEX agreed with EURUS the purchase a portion of the electric energy generated for a period of no less than 20 years. EURUS is a wind farm with an installed capacity of 250 MW operated by ACCIONA in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $67 (unaudited) if CEMEX receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, energy supply from wind source is variable in nature and final amounts will be determined considering the final MWh effectively received at the agreed prices per unit.\n- \u00b7 CEMEX maintains a commitment initiated in April 2004 to purchase the energy generated by Termoel\u00e9ctrica del Golfo ('TEG') until 2027 for its overall electricity needs in Mexico. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $124 (unaudited) if CEMEX receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, final amounts will be determined considering the final MWh effectively received at the agreed prices per unit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In regards with the above, CEMEX also committed to supply TEG and another third-party electrical energy generating plant adjacent to TEG all fuel necessary for their operations until the year 2027, equivalent to approximately 1.2 million tons of petroleum coke per year. CEMEX covers its commitments under this agreement acquiring the volume of fuel from sources in the international markets and Mexico.\n- \u00b7 CEMEX Zement GmbH ('CZ'), CEMEX's subsidiary in Germany, held a long-term energy supply contract until 2022 with STEAG - Industriekraftwerk R\u00fcdersdorf GmbH ('SIKW') in connection with the overall electricity needs of CEMEX's R\u00fcdersdorf plant. Based on the contract, each year CZ has the option to fix in advance the volume of energy in terms of MW that it will acquire from SIKW, with the option to adjust the purchase amount one time on a monthly and quarterly basis. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $17 (unaudited) if CEMEX receives all its energy allocation.\n- \u00b7 On October 24, 2018, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. entered into an energy financial hedge agreement in Mexico, commencing October 1, 2019 and for a period of 20 years. Through the contract, the Company fixed the megawatt hour cost over an electric energy volume of 400 thousand megawatts hour per year, through the payment of 25.375 dollars per megawatt hour of electric power in exchange for a market price. The committed price to pay will increase 1.5% annually. The differential between the agreed price and the market price is settled monthly. CEMEX considers this agreement as a hedge for a portion of its aggregate consumption of electric energy in Mexico and recognizes the result of the exchange of price differentials described previously in the Income Statement as a part of the costs of energy. During 2020, the Company paid $0.4. CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V.  does not record this agreement at fair value since there is not a deep market for electric power in Mexico that would effectively allow for its valuation.\n\n## 24.3) COMMITMENTS FROM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nIn some countries, CEMEX has self-insured health care benefits plans for its active employees, which are managed on cost plus fee arrangements with major insurance companies or provided through health maintenance organizations. As of December 31, 2020, in certain plans, CEMEX has established stoploss limits for continued medical assistance derived from a specific cause (e.g., an automobile accident, illness, etc.) ranging from 23 thousand dollars to 550 thousand dollars. In other plans, CEMEX has established stop-loss limits per employee regardless of the number of events ranging from 100 thousand dollars to 2.5 million dollars. The contingency for CEMEX if all employees qualifying for health care benefits required medical services simultaneously is significantly. However, CEMEX believes this scenario is remote. The amount expensed through self-insured health care benefits was $61 in 2020, $62 in 2019 and $62 in 2018.\n\n## 25) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n## 25.1) PROVISIONS RESULTING FROM LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nCEMEX is involved in various significant legal proceedings, the adverse resolutions of which are deemed probable and imply the incurrence of losses and/ or cash outflows or the delivery of other resources owned by CEMEX. As a result, certain provisions and/or losses have been recognized in the financial statements, representing the best estimate of cash outflows. CEMEX believes that it will not make significant expenditure in excess of the amounts recorded. As of December 31, 2020, the details of the most significant events giving effect to provisions or losses are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX had accrued environmental remediation liabilities through its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom pertaining to closed and current landfill sites for the confinement of waste, representing the NPV of such obligations for an amount in pounds sterling equivalent to $178. Expenditure was assessed and quantified over the period in which the sites have the potential to cause environmental harm, which is generally consistent with the views taken by the regulator as being up to 60 years from the date of closure. The assessed expenditure included the costs of monitoring the sites and the installation, repair and renewal of environmental infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX had accrued environmental remediation liabilities through its subsidiaries in the United States for $66, related to: a) the disposal of various materials in accordance with past industry practice, which might currently be categorized as hazardous substances or wastes; and b) the cleanup of sites used or operated by CEMEX, including discontinued operations, regarding the disposal of hazardous substances or waste, either individually or jointly with other parties. Most of the proceedings are in the preliminary stages and a final resolution might take several years. CEMEX does not believe that it will be required to spend significant sums on these matters in excess of the amounts previously recorded. The ultimate cost that may be incurred to resolve these environmental issues cannot be assured until all environmental studies, investigations, remediation work and negotiations with, or litigation against, potential sources of recovery have been completed.\n- \u00b7 In 2012, in connection with a contract entered into in 1990 (the 'Quarry Contract') by CEMEX Granulats Rh\u00f4ne M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e ('CEMEX GRM'), one of CEMEX's subsidiaries in France, with SCI La Quinoniere ('SCI') pursuant to which CEMEX GRM had drilling rights to extract reserves and do quarry remediation at a quarry in the Rh\u00f4ne region of France, SCI filed a claim against CEMEX GRM for breach of the Quarry Contract, requesting the rescission of such contract and damages plus interest for a revised amount in euros equivalent to $82, arguing that CEMEX GRM partially filled the quarry allegedly in breach of the terms of the Quarry Contract. After many hearings, resolutions and appeals over the years, on November 25, 2020, the expert appointed by the court of appeals determined an amount of loss of profits of $0.79 and a cost of backfilling the quarry in $15. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX had accrued a provision through its subsidiaries in France for $8 in connection with the best estimate of the remediation costs resulting from this claim. Although the final amount may differ, CEMEX considers that any such amount should not have a material adverse impact on CEMEX's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nonetheless, until all stages in the procedures are exhausted in each proceeding, CEMEX cannot assure the achievement of a final favorable resolution. As of December 31, 2020, the most significant events with a quantification of the potential loss, when it is determinable and would not impair the outcome of the relevant proceeding, were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 On September 20, 2018, triggered by heavy rainfall, a landslide causing damages and fatalities (the 'Landslide') occurred in a site located within an area covered by mining rights of APO Land & Quarry Corporation ('ALQC') in Naga City, Cebu, Philippines. ALQC is a principal raw material supplier of APO Cement Corporation ('APO'), a wholly owned subsidiary of CHP. CEMEX indirectly owns a minority 40% stake in ALQC. On November 19, 2018, 40 individuals and one legal entity (on behalf of 8,000 individuals allegedly affected by the Landslide) filed an environmental class action lawsuit at the Regional Trial Court (the 'Court') of Talisay, Cebu, against CHP, ALQC, APO, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the City Government of Naga, and the Province of Cebu. Plaintiffs claim that the Landslide occurred because of the defendants' gross negligence and seek, among other relief, (a) damages for an amount in Philippine Pesos equivalent to $90, (b) a rehabilitation fund for an amount in Philippine Pesos equivalent to $10, and (c) the issuance of a Temporary Environment Protection Order against ALQC aiming to prevent ALQC from performing further quarrying activities while the case is still pending. This last request was rejected by the Court on August 16, 2019 and after reconsideration, the resolution became final on December 5, 2020. Moreover, on September 30, 2019 the Court dismissed the case against CHP and APO, order that is not yet final and that was appealed by the plaintiffs on November 26, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, because of the status and preliminary stage of the lawsuit, CEMEX is not able to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result in this lawsuit; and CEMEX is neither able to assess if a final adverse result in this lawsuit would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, liquidity and financial position.\n- \u00b7 On June 12, 2018, the Authority for Consumer Protection and Competition Defense of Panama (the 'Panama Authority') carried out an investigation against Cemento Bayano and other competitors for the alleged commission of monopolistic practices in relation to the gray cement and the ready-mix concrete markets. From this investigation, the Panama Authority considered the possible existence of monopolistic or anticompetitive practices consisting of: (i) price fixing and/or production restriction of gray cement sold to ready-mix concrete producers in Panama; and (ii) unilateral and/or joint predatory acts and/or cross subsidies in the ready-mix concrete market. On October 8, 2020, the Panama Authority issued a resolution that closed the investigation. The resolution concluded that Cemento Bayano, among other competitors, did not engage in an absolute monopolistic practice, consisting of an agreement and/or coordination of the sale price of cement or a restriction of production. The resolution also specifies that the analysis carried out and the evidence collected does not allow to conclude that the parties under investigation carried out a predatory practice in their production and commercialization of ready-mixed concrete, which is considered a relative monopolistic practice.\n- \u00b7 Certain of CEMEX's subsidiaries in the United States were notified of a grand jury subpoena dated March 29, 2018 issued by the United States Department of Justice ('DOJ') related to an investigation of possible antitrust law violations in connection with CEMEX's sales (and related sales practices) of gray Portland cement and slag in the United States and its territories. The objective of this subpoena is to gather facts necessary to make an informed decision about whether violations of U.S. law have occurred. CEMEX has been cooperating with the DOJ and is complying with the subpoena. As of December 31, 2020, given the status of the investigation, CEMEX is not able to assess if this investigation will lead to any fines, penalties or remedies, or if such fines, penalties or remedies, if any, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position.\n- \u00b7 In December 2016, the Parent Company received subpoenas from the SEC seeking information to determine whether there have been any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act stemming from the Maceo Project. These subpoenas do not mean that the SEC has concluded that the Parent Company or any of its affiliates violated the law. The Parent Company has been cooperating with the SEC and intends to continue cooperating fully with the SEC. The DOJ also opened an investigation into this matter. In this regard, on March 12, 2018, the DOJ issued a grand jury subpoena to the Parent Company relating to its operations in Colombia and other jurisdictions. The Parent Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC, the DOJ and any other investigatory entity. As of December 31, 2020, the Parent Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of either the SEC investigation or the DOJ investigation, or any other investigation that may arise, or, because of the current status of the SEC investigation and the preliminary nature of the DOJ investigation, the potential sanctions which could be borne by the Parent Company, or if such sanctions, if any, would have a material adverse impact on CEMEX results of operations, liquidity or financial position.\n- \u00b7 In February 2014, the Egyptian Tax Authority requested Assiut Cement Company ('ACC'), a subsidiary of CEMEX in Egypt, the payment of a development levy on clay used in the Egyptian cement industry for an amount equivalent as of December 31, 2020 to $20 for the period from May 5, 2008 to November 30, 2011. In March 2014, ACC appealed the levy and on September 2014 it was notified that it obtained a favorable resolution from the Ministerial Committee for Resolution of Investment Disputes, which instructed the Egyptian Tax Authority to cease claiming from ACC the payment of the levy on clay. It was further decided that the levy on clay should not be imposed on imported clinker. Nonetheless, in May 2016, the Egyptian Tax Authority challenged ACC's right to cancel the levy on clay before the North Cairo Court, which referred the cases to Cairo's Administrative Judiciary Court. These cases have been adjourned by the Commissioners of the Cairo Administrative Judiciary Court, which on November 2, 2020 referred the cases to the Court and established a first hearing session for February 15, 2021. CEMEX does not expect that such referral will prejudice ACC's favorable legal position in this dispute. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX does not expect a material adverse impact due to this matter in its results of operations, liquidity or financial position.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In September 2012, in connection with a lawsuit submitted to a first instance court in Assiut, Egypt in 2011, the first instance court of Assiut issued a resolution to nullify the Share Purchase Agreement (the 'SPA') pursuant to which CEMEX acquired in 1999 a controlling interest in Assiut Cement Company. In addition, during 2011 and 2012, lawsuits seeking, among other things, the annulment of the SPA were filed by different plaintiffs, including 25 former employees of ACC, before Cairo's State Council. After several appeals, hearings and resolutions over the years, the cases are held in Cairo's 7th Circuit State Council Administrative Judiciary Court awaiting the High Constitutional Court to pronounce regarding the challenges against the constitutionality of Law 32/2014 filed by the plaintiffs, which protects CEMEX's investments in Egypt. These matters are complex and take several years to be resolved. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX is not able to assess the likelihood of an adverse resolution regarding these lawsuits nor is able to assess if the Constitutional Court will dismiss Law 32/2014, but, regarding the lawsuits, if adversely resolved, CEMEX does not believe the resolutions in the first instance would have an immediate material adverse impact on CEMEX's operations, liquidity and financial condition. However, if CEMEX exhausts all legal recourses available, a final adverse resolution of these lawsuits, or if the Constitutional Court dismisses Law 32/2014, this could adversely impact the ongoing matters regarding the SPA, which could have a material adverse impact on CEMEX's operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\nIn connection with the legal proceedings presented in notes 25.1 and 25.2, the exchange rates as of December 31, 2020 used by CEMEX to convert the amounts in local currency to their equivalents in dollars were the official closing exchange rates of 0.8183 Euro per dollar, 0.7313 British pounds sterling per dollar and 15.7964 Egyptian pounds per dollar.\n\nIn addition to the legal proceedings described above in notes 25.1 and 25.2, as of December 31, 2020, CEMEX is involved in various legal proceedings of minor impact that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings involve: 1) product warranty claims; 2) claims for environmental damages; 3) indemnification claims relating to acquisitions or divestitures; 4) claims to revoke permits and/or concessions; and 5) other diverse civil, administrative, commercial and lawless actions. CEMEX considers that in those instances in which obligations have been incurred, CEMEX has accrued adequate provisions to cover the related risks. CEMEX believes these matters will be resolved without any significant effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, in relation to certain ongoing legal proceedings, CEMEX is sometimes able to make and disclose reasonable estimates of the expected loss or range of possible loss, as well as disclose any provision accrued for such loss, but for a limited number of ongoing legal proceedings, CEMEX may not be able to make a reasonable estimate of the expected loss or range of possible loss or may be able to do so but believes that disclosure of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice CEMEX's position in the ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in these cases, CEMEX has disclosed qualitative information with respect to the nature and characteristics of the contingency but has not disclosed the estimate of the range of potential loss.\n\n## 25.3) OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROCESSES\n\nIn connection with the cement plant located in the municipality of Maceo in Colombia (the 'Maceo Plant'), as described in note 15.1, as of December 31, 2020, the plant has not initiated commercial operations considering several significant processes for the profitability of the investment. The evolution and status of the main issues related to such plant are described as follows:\n\n## Maceo Plant - Memorandums of understanding\n\n- \u00b7 In August 2012, CEMEX Colombia signed a memorandum of understanding (the 'MOU') with the representative of the entity CI Calizas y Minerales S.A. ('CI Calizas'), for the acquisition and transfer of assets mainly comprising land, the mining concession and the shares of Zona Franca Especial Cementera del Magdalena Medio S.A.S. ('Zomam') (holder of the free trade zone concession). In addition, in December 2013, CEMEX Colombia engaged the same representative of CI Calizas to also represent in the name and on behalf of CEMEX Colombia in the acquisition of certain land adjacent to the plant, signing a new memorandum of understanding (the 'Land MOU'). Under the MOU and the Land MOU, CEMEX Colombia made cash advances to this representative for amounts in Colombian Pesos equivalent to approximately $13.4 of a total of approximately $22.5, and paid interest accrued over the unpaid committed amount for approximately $1.2. These amounts considering the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016 of 3,000.75 Colombian Pesos per U.S. Dollar. In September 2016, after confirming irregularities in the acquisition processes by means of investigations and internal audits initiated in response to complaints received, which were reported to Colombia's Attorney General (the 'Attorney General'), providing the findings obtained, and considering that such payments were made in breach of the Parent Company's and CLH's policies, the Company decided to terminate the employment relationship with then those responsible for the Planning and Legal areas and accepted the resignation of the then Chief Executive Officer. Moreover, because of the findings and considering the available legal opinions as well as the low likelihood of recovering those advances, in December 2016, CEMEX Colombia write off such advances from its investments in progress (note 15.1) and cancelled the remaining advance payable.",

        "page_content": "## Maceo Plant - Expiration of property process and other related matters\n\n- \u00b7 After the signing of the MOU, in December 2012, a former shareholder of CI Calizas, who presumptively transferred its shares of CI Calizas two years before the signing of the MOU, was linked to a process of expiration of property initiated by the Attorney General. Amongst other measures, the Attorney General ordered the seizure and consequent suspension of the right to dispose the assets subject to the MOU, including the shares of Zomam acquired by CEMEX Colombia before the beginning of such process. As a third party acting in good faith and free of guilt, CEMEX Colombia joined the expiration of property process fully cooperating with the Attorney General. As of December 31, 2020, it is estimated that a final resolution in the ongoing expiration of property process, the evidentiary phase of which is about to begin, may take between 10 and 15 years from its beginning. As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to the expiration of property process of the assets subject to the MOU and the failures to legally formalize the purchases under the Land MOU, CEMEX Colombia does not have the legal representation of Zomam, is not the rightful owner of the land and is not the assigned entity of the mining concession.\n\nIn addition, there is an ongoing criminal investigation that resulted in a legal resolution by means of which an indictment was issued to two of the Company's former officers and to CI Calizas' representative. CEMEX is not able to anticipate the actions that criminal judges may impose against these people.\n\n## Maceo Plant - Lease contract, mandate agreement and operation contract\n\n- \u00b7 In July 2013, CEMEX Colombia signed with the provisional depository designated by the former Drugs National Department (then depository of the assets subject to the expiration of property process), which functions after its liquidation were assumed by the Administrator of Special Assets ( Sociedad de Activos Especiales S.A.S . or the 'SAE'), a lease contract for a period of five years by means of which CEMEX Colombia was duly authorized to build and operate the plant (the 'Lease Contract'). Moreover, in 2014, the provisional depository granted a mandate (the 'Mandate') to CEMEX Colombia for an indefinite period for the same purpose of continuing the construction and operation of the plant. On July 15, 2018, the Lease Contract expired.\n- \u00b7 On April 12, 2019, CEMEX Colombia, CCL and another of its subsidiaries reached a conciliatory agreement with the SAE and CI Calizas before the Attorney General's Office and signed a contract of Mining Operation, Manufacturing and Delivery Services and Leasing of Properties for Cement Production (the 'Operation Contract'), which will allow CEMEX Colombia to continue using the assets subject to the aforementioned expiration of property process for an initial term of 21 years that can be renewed for 10 additional years, provided that the extension of the mining concession is obtained. The Operation Contract was signed by CI Calizas and Zomam with the authorization of the SAE as delegate of these last two companies. In addition to certain one-time initial payments in Colombian pesos equivalent to $1.5 settled in 2019 and 2020, the Operation Contract includes the following payments:\n- \u00b7 An annual payment equivalent to 15 thousand dollars to CI Calizas for the use of land that will be adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index.\n- \u00b7 Once the Maceo Plant begins commercial operations, CEMEX Colombia and/or a subsidiary will pay on a quarterly basis: a) 0.9% of the net sales resulting from the cement produced in the plant as compensation to CI Calizas for the right of CEMEX Colombia to extract and use the mineral reserves; and b) 0.8% of the net sales resulting from the cement produced in the plant as payment to Zomam for cement manufacturing and delivery services, as long as Zomam maintains the Free Zone benefit, or, 0.3% of the aforementioned net sales exclusively for the use of equipment, in case that Zomam losses the benefits as Free Trade Zone.\n- \u00b7 The Operation Contract will continue in force regardless of the result in the expiration of property process, except that the applicable criminal judge would recognize ownership rights of the assets under expiration of property to CEMEX Colombia and its subsidiary, in which case the Operation Contract would no longer be needed and would be early terminated.\n- \u00b7 Under the presumption that CEMEX Colombia conducted itself in good faith, CEMEX considers that it will be able to keep ownership of the plant, and that the rest of its investments are protected by Colombian law, under which, if a person builds on the property of a third party, with full knowledge of such third party, this third party may: a) take ownership of the plant, provided a corresponding indemnity to CEMEX Colombia, or otherwise, b) oblige CEMEX Colombia to purchase the land. Nonetheless, had this not be the case, CEMEX Colombia would take all necessary actions to safeguard its rights. If the expiration of property over the assets subject to the MOU is ordered in favor of the State, if the assets were adjudicated to a third party in a public tender offer, considering the signing of the Operation Contract, such third party would have to subrogate to the Operation Contract. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX is not able to estimate whether the expiration of property over the assets subject to the MOU will be ordered in favor of the State, or, if applicable, if the assets would be adjudicated to a third party in a public tender offer.\n\n## Maceo Plant - Resource against the capitalization of Zomam\n\n- \u00b7 On December 7, 2020, the Parent Company, acting as shareholder of CEMEX Colombia, filed a lawsuit before the Business Superintendency of Colombia ( Superintendencia de Sociedades de Colombia or the 'Business Superintendency'), requesting a declaration of inefficiency and subsequent declaration of invalidity and inexistence of the equity contribution in-kind carried out by CEMEX Colombia to Zomam on December 11, 2015. In the event of a favorable resolution, all the effects of the equity contribution would roll back. As a consequence, the assets contributed to Zomam, which had a value of $43, would revert to CEMEX Colombia in exchange for the shares in Zomam it received as a result of the capitalization. As a result of the current consolidation of Zomam, such favorable resolution would not have any effect in CEMEX's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the legal claim has not yet been admitted by the Business Superintendency.",

        "page_content": "## Maceo Plant - Status in connection with the commissioning of the plant\n\n- \u00b7 On September 3, 2019, CEMEX Colombia was notified of the resolution issued by Corantioquia's Directive Council, the regional environmental authority ('Corantioquia'), regarding the approval for the subtraction of a portion of the plant from the Integrated Management District of the Canyon of the Alicante River ('IMD'). As of December 31, 2020, the commissioning of the Maceo plant and the conclusion of the access road remain suspended until the successful modification of the environmental license for up to 990 thousand tons per year, which request was filed before Corantioquia on June 17, 2020 and was entered into review on July 2, 2020; remaining pending a resolution from this entity. In connection with the obtention of the permits required for the conclusion of several sections of the access road, on November 10, 2020, Maceo's municipality issued the approval of the Road Infrastructure Intervention project and, on December 11, 2020, issued a decree establishing the public utility of the access road,  required authorizations for both, building the road and acquire the required land. In respect to the modification of the permitted land use where the project is located, CEMEX Colombia received favorable criteria from Corantioquia regarding the change of land use because of the approval for the subtraction from the IMD, which was endorsed by the municipality of Maceo on August 29, 2020, which allows for an industrial and mining use compatible with the project. As of December 31, 2020, CEMEX continues working to resolve these matters as soon as possible and limits its activities to those for which it has the relevant authorizations.\n\n## 26) RELATED PARTIES\n\nAll significant balances and transactions between the entities that constitute the CEMEX group have been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These balances with related parties resulted primarily from: (i) the sale and purchase of goods between group entities; (ii) the sale and/ or acquisition of subsidiaries' shares within the CEMEX group; (iii) the invoicing of administrative services, rentals, trademarks and commercial name rights, royalties and other services rendered between group entities; and (iv) loans between related parties. Transactions between group entities are conducted on arm's length terms based on market prices and conditions. When market prices and/or market conditions are not readily available, CEMEX conducts transfer pricing studies in the countries in which it operates to assure compliance with regulations applicable to transactions between related parties.\n\nThe definition of related parties includes entities or individuals outside the CEMEX group, which, due to their relationship with CEMEX, may take advantage of being in a privileged situation. Likewise, this applies to cases in which CEMEX may take advantage of such relationships and obtain benefits in its financial position or operating results. CEMEX's transactions with related parties are executed under market conditions.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in ordinary course of business, CEMEX has entered into transactions with related parties for the sale and/or purchase of products, sale and/or purchase of services or the lease of assets, all of which are not significant for CEMEX and to the best of CEMEX's knowledge are not significant to the related party, are incurred for non-significant amounts for CEMEX and are executed under market terms and conditions following the same commercial principles and authorizations applied to other third parties. These identified transactions, as applicable, are approved or ratified at least annually by the Parent Company's Board of Directors. For CEMEX, none of these transactions are material to be disclosed separately.\n\nIn addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate amount of compensation of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. Board of Directors, including alternate directors, and CEMEX's top management executives was $35, $40 and $38, respectively. Of these amounts, $29 in 2020, $34 in 2019, $29 in 2018, were paid as base compensation plus performance bonuses, including pension and post-employment benefits. In addition, $6 in 2020, $6 in 2019 and $9 in 2018 of the aggregate amounts in each year, corresponded to allocations of Parent Company CPOs under CEMEX's executive share-based compensation programs.\n\n## 27) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn January 12, 2021, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. issued $1,750 of its 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due on July 11, 2031 denominated in U.S. Dollars (the 'July 2031 Notes'), which bear interest semi-annually at an annual rate of 3.875% and mature on July 11, 2031. The July 2031 Notes were issued at a price of 100% of face value and will be callable commencing on July 11, 2026. CEMEX intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the July 2031 Notes for general corporate purposes, including to repay other indebtedness, all in accordance with CEMEX's 2017 Facilities Agreement (note 17.1). The July 2031 Notes share in the Collateral pledged for the benefit of the lenders under the 2017 Facilities Agreement and other secured obligations having the benefit of such Collateral and are guaranteed by the same group of guarantors (note 17.1).\n\nOn January 13, 2021, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. announced that it has issued a notice of full redemption for $1,000 worth of its April 2026 Notes, which bear interest semi-annually at an annual rate of 7.75% (note 17.1). Moreover, the Company has also issued a notice of partial redemption of $750 of its January 2025 Notes, which bear interest semi-annually at an annual rate of 5.70%, out of the $1,071 that is in circulation (note 17.1). The full redemption of the April 2026 Notes and partial redemption of the January 2025 Notes is expected to be concluded on February 16, 2021.",

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Mexico, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The goodwill balance represents 31% of the Group's total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, management of the Group recognized impairment of goodwill for $1,020 million related to the groups of CGUs in USA. Goodwill is tested for impairment when required upon the occurrence of internal or external indicators of impairment or at least once a year, during the last quarter of such year.\n\nWe have identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for these two groups of CGUs as a key audit matter because the estimated value in use involved a high degree of subjectivity. Specifically, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate used to calculate the value in use of the two groups of CGUs (USA and Spain) were challenging and changes to these assumptions had a significant impact on the value in use.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included, among others, the following:\n\nWe performed sensitivity analyses over the discount rate and the long-term growth rate assumptions to assess their impact on the determination of the value in use of the two groups of CGUs (USA and Spain).\n\nWe evaluated the Group's forecasted long-term growth rates for these two groups of CGUs by comparing the growth assumptions to publicly available data.\n\nWe compared the Group's historical cash flow forecasts to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists, who assisted in:\n\n- -  Evaluating the discount rates for these two groups of CGUs, by comparing them with a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available data for comparable entities; and\n- -  Developing an estimate of the value in use of the groups of CGUs using the  Group's  cash  flow  forecasts  and  determining  an  independently developed discount rate and comparing the results of our estimates to the Group's estimates of value in use.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020, to be filed with the National Banking and Securities Commission (Mexico) (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores) and the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores) ('the Annual Report') but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.  The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge\n\nobtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

        "page_content": "## Scope and Boundaries\n\n## General Considerations\n\nCEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. is incorporated as a publicly traded variable stock corporation (sociedad an\u00f3nima burs\u00e1til de capital variable) organized under the laws of Mexico. Except as the context otherwise may require, references in this integrated report to 'CEMEX,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' refer to CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. and its consolidated entities.\n\n## Reporting Scope\n\nCEMEX began publishing Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) reports in 1996, and has annually published its Sustainable Development Reports since 2003, covering a broad range of issues related to economic, environmental, social, and governance performance.\n\nSince 2016, our Integrated Reports are intended to provide a holistic analysis of the company's strategic vision, performance, governance, and value creation, while fostering a more in-depth understanding of the financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators that the company uses to manage its business over the short, medium, and long term.\n\n## Boundary and Reporting Period\n\nIn preparation of this report, we consolidated information from all of our countries and operations.  It covers our global cement, readymix concrete, and aggregates business lines, presenting our financial and nonfinancial performance, progress, achievements, and challenges for the 2020 calendar year, which is also the company's fiscal year. Our materiality analysis guided our reporting process, and the issues included in this report particularly match those that CEMEX management and\n\nour stakeholders found of highest importance for our operations, as reflected in our recently updated Materiality Matrix covering both financial and sustainability issues.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the information provided in this report is for the company as a whole. We have included information for the operations in which we have financial and operative control.  If a plant is sold, its information is no longer included in our data or considered in our targets.  If we have restated certain data sets from previous years because of improvements to our data-collection systems or changes to our business, each case is clearly marked.  Unless something else is explicitly indicated, all monetary amounts are reported in U.S. dollars. All references to 'tons' are to metric tons.\n\nThe information in our 2020 Integrated Report came from several sources, including internal management systems and performance databases, as well as annual surveys applied across all of our countries.\n\nWe continually aim to improve the transparency and completeness of each report that we produce, while streamlining our processes and the way in which we provide information.  To this end, we include a limited assurance statement from KPMG, an independent organization that verified the data and calculation process for our annual indicators associated with CO2 and other emissions, health and safety, circular economy, biodiversity, environmental and social incidents, and water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data Measurement Techniques\n\nWe employ the following protocols and techniques for measuring the sustainability key performance indicators (KPI) that we report:\n\nCO2 emissions: CEMEX reports absolute and specific CO2 emissions following the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) Sustainability Framework Guidelines and the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing (November 2018), based on the CEN Standard EN 19694-3 (Stationary source emissions - Determination of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in energy-intensive industries - Part 3: Cement Industry). The measurement is based on the mass balance methodology, fully described in the CEN standard on CO2 emission from the cement industry EN-19694-3, and applied through the spreadsheet of the Cement CO2 Protocol (previously known as WBCSD-CSI Cement CO2 and Energy Protocol v. 3.1). It considers direct emissions occurring from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, excluding those from the combustion of biomass that are reported separately (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed in the company's owned or controlled equipment (Scope 2). For countries covered by the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), CO2 data corresponds to the one validated by an independent verifier in accordance with the applicable Accreditation and Verification Regulation.\n\nIn addition, we continued the engagement with our External Advisory Panel, whose members provide very valuable and objective feedback on our reporting every year.",

These methods fully comply with GCCA Guidelines for Emissions Monitoring and Reporting. All information is reported to CEMEX databases, processed, calculated, and validated to provide a final group value. The values are calculated in Standard for 0\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere and 10% Oxygen (O2) content at measuring point.\n\nEnergy: Fuel consumption indicators are reported to internal CEMEX databases in which 'conventional,' 'alternative,' and 'biomass fuels' are classified according to the Cement CO2 Protocol spreadsheet. Heat values are obtained from on-site analysis (where applicable), provided by suppliers or standards from recognized sources.\n\nClinker factor and alternative fuels: All material consumption is reported to internal CEMEX databases in which 'alternative materials' are defined following the standards from the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for co-processing fuels and raw materials in cement manufacturing (November 2018). The 'clinker/ cement factor' is calculated using the Basic Parameters set out in the GCCA Sustainability Framework Guidelines and according to GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing, procedures indicated in Cement CO2 Protocol spreadsheet with information obtained from the databases.\n\nHealth and safety: Intelex, which feeds an internal database, collects all related health and safety information from each site and automatically provides the appropriate information to calculate the indicators. The database is configured using the GCCA definitions. health and safety indicators are calculated according to the Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of safety in cement manufacturing, October 2019 version.\n\n## Alignment with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards\n\nTo enhance our sustainability communication to our stakeholders and comply with internationally agreed disclosures and metrics, CEMEX uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards to prepare its Sustainable Development Reports. From 2008 to 2013, we met an application level of A+ using GRI-G3.  From 2014 to 2016, we applied the GRI-G4 Guidelines.\n\nStarting in 2017, we have migrated to the GRI Standards.  For the Materiality Disclosures Service, GRI Services reviewed that the GRI content index is clearly presented and the references for Disclosures 102-40 to 102-49 align with appropriate sections in the body of the report.  Furthermore, our GRI Content Index cross-references with the UN Global Compact principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have also submitted the current report to the GRI requesting the Materiality Disclosures Service, which is reflected in the corresponding GRI mark.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option.\n\n- To access our 2020 GRI Content Index, go to https://www.cemex.com/sustainability/ reports/global-reports\n\n## United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress\n\nThis report also constitutes our Communication on Progress (CoP) toward the commitments of the UN Global Compact (UNGC).  As a participant in the UNGC, we work to align our company's operations and strategies with its 10 principles.  As demonstrated within the content of this report, we are also committed to helping the world meet the targets of the Paris Agreement and contribute to the achievement of the UN SDGs.\n\n## Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB)\n\nIn 2019, we started reporting aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) for the Construction Material industry-specific requirements.

The Panel reviewed two drafts of the Integrated Report, providing specific advice for improvement in strategy, performance, and reporting. The comments on the report focus mainly on current activities, recommendations, and strategic ideas worth exploring in the future.\n\n## Reporting Framework, Style, and Improvements\n\nThe Panel is pleased to witness the continued evolution of the CEMEX 2020 Integrated Report, which provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of CEMEX's strategic vision, giving a thorough description about the extent of the achievements during the period of the report, the impacts generated, the challenges, and the risks and opportunities, the company is facing and the actions it is implementing in response, whether to mitigate or to take up. The report also conveys the company's effort to visualize and anticipate changes in the business environment and the broader context.\n\nThe facts and achievements highlighted in the report are evidence that the company is dynamic, forward-thinking, and resilient in a scenario of complex challenges and great uncertainty. The measures implemented by CEMEX to mitigate the effects of the health emergency on strategy and business, operation and on its wider stakeholders, reveal significant results: 2.9 million people benefited, more than 70 alliances created in social actions, 84% of workers satisfied with the measures implemented.\n\nThe Panel recognizes and appreciates CEMEX's commitment to preparing the report following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, which brought focus to the most material aspects in the business and helped craft a document that communicates in an open and transparent way with CEMEX's stakeholders.\n\n## Governance and Diversity\n\nThe Panel recognizes that CEMEX's board has an independent majority of 10, and that one member is a woman, which added independence and enables it to effectively fulfill its critical role of overseeing management on behalf of stakeholders. However, as before, the Panel emphasizes its recommendation to continue with the inclusion of additional qualified women for the next generation of board members and encourages CEMEX to adhere to international standards on board composition and diversity.\n\n## Sustainability as Part of the Strategic Pillars of CEMEX\n\nThe Panel commends CEMEX on continuing to include sustainability as one of the company's top priorities, as mentioned in the Letter to Stakeholders. This commitment is reflected in the progress on CO2 emissions reductions; the launching of Vertua \u00ae , the first Net-Zero CO2 Concrete solution in the industry; and by the reduced sustainability risk that allows the company to have access to one of the largest sustainability-linked loans in the world. CEMEX is making great progress in finding and developing sustainable products and solutions, and we encourage the company to continue the strong emphasis on R&D by increasing its research capacity in the future. However, we found that having the innovative materials available does not mean customers are going to buy them, especially if the price is higher when compared to other similar products. More needs to be done to show how these products will become the norm.\n\nThe Panel recommends including more information about CEMEX's strategy to promote new and innovative materials, as well as how sustainability helps create business value and how the company helps customers meet their sustainability aspirations in the next report.\n\nThe Panel acknowledges the formulation of the 2030 Sustainability Goals, which express and communicate the strong and explicit purpose of CEMEX's senior management to advance towards sustainability and",

We would also like to highlight that compliance with the 2030 Sustainability Goals has been associated with the variable compensation of senior management. This is a major step to strengthen sustainability as part of the company's culture.\n\nAnother move in the right direction is including in the report the issues addressed by the Board-level Sustainability Committee during 2020 and its contribution to the critical and strategic challenges at CEMEX. The Panel welcomes the fact that the 2020 Integrated Report discloses the topics discussed in the Sustainability Committee's quarterly meetings as well as the outcomes coming from them. By doing so, it conveys confidence that this Board Committee plays a key role in building a sustainable business model.\n\n## Materiality Topics\n\nCEMEX has been improving its Materiality Matrix, which brings together the most important financial and non-financial topics for the company and its stakeholders. The matrix facilitates CEMEX's effort to define risks, opportunities, and key performance indicators, and to set and report on strategic targets. The Panel is pleased with the improvements achieved in the materiality assessment and with the company continuing to follow the Global Reporting Initiative framework for its construction.\n\nThe Panel appreciates that CEMEX included a very clear table that shows at a glance the communication mechanism with its stakeholders, how to connect the key stakeholders' concerns with the engagement channels the company uses, and with strategic outcomes.\n\nOn Net Value to Society, CEMEX makes a valuable attempt to estimate its positive and negative economic, social, and environmental impacts. However, as in last year's report, the Panel encourages the company to include more detailed information on how these impacts are calculated for next year's report.\n\n## Safety\n\nThe Panel is pleased that during a year made complex by the pandemic, top management continued to significantly\n\nincrease activity on the Zero4Life objective to improve and reinforce safety culture across all operations, focusing on employees, contractor management, and driving safety. We also congratulate the company for the rapid response to release and implement 52 hygiene and safety protocols to cope with COVID-19 challenges.\n\nAdditionally, we are pleased that CEMEX continues investing in the initiative \"Building a Strong Health and Safety, Culture\" which has standardized global programs, and focuses on sharing best practices, and using of innovation and technology to instill a safety culture across all the company's operations. In regard to the importance of Health and Safety, the Panel once again recommends being transparent across the entire supply chain.\n\n## Emissions and Other Environmental Issues\n\nThe Panel recognizes that Climate Change has been a priority for CEMEX for many years and congratulates the company for its continuous work on implementing actions and technologies to mitigate its impacts. The Panel is especially pleased with CEMEX's achievement of close to 35% net CO2 reduction per ton of cementitious in 2020 vs. 1990 baseline in its European operations and setting a 55% target for 2030 for this region.\n\nPost COVID-19 recovery is being driven by public funds with increased sustainability requirements (e.g., Europe Green Deal and the U.S. re-joining Paris agreement). However, the Panel could not see how the company intends to utilize this growing commitment to sustainability to move customers towards the innovative materials CEMEX is a global leader in developing. We recommend including a section addressing CEMEX's progress in capturing these market opportunities in the next report.\n\nThe Panel also acknowledges the company's ambitious goal to deliver globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050 and the concerted effort that it is making in product research and development. However, the report is not clear enough on how these initiatives link to the business strategy of the company. The Panel is looking forward to seeing the advances on plans and targets and how they relate to the main business in next year's report.\n\n## Energy and Water Consumption\n\nThe Panel is pleased that CEMEX leads the industry in the use of clean electricity and that it has established a target of sourcing 40% of their projected power consumption in the cement operations from clean energy. We celebrate the initiative with Synhelion SA to harness solar energy to fully decarbonize the clinker manufacturing process and to have a pilot installation by 2022. The Panel encourages additional development in this area.\n\nOn water consumption, the Panel acknowledges that cement production is not a water-intensive process and that the company had a good start with the water stress map updated in 2019, which identified more than 1,500 cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates sites located in water-stressed zones. The Panel again exhorts the company to put in place a water action plan as soon as possible and implement it with clearly defined targets, as it has done with CO2.\n\n## Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\n\nThe Panel recognizes CEMEX's commitment to protecting biodiversity and the environment using the highest international standards. The company's Corporate Biodiversity Policy, aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi Biodiversity targets, has been key to align CEMEX's biodiversity initiatives with their decision-making process, management system, and business model. The excellent implementation of this policy helped CEMEX to be awarded the Corporate Conservation Leadership Award by Wildlife Habitat Council in 2020.\n\nThe Panel celebrates that the company is close to the goal of implementing local Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP) in every quarry that overlaps with high-value biodiversity areas, and also the commitment to enhance biodiversity (i.e., Net Positive Impact) at a quarry level.\n\nThe Panel is also pleased to see further progress at El Carmen Reserve for introducing 60 specimens of genetically pure bison, after 20 years of preserving the site. The results, the impact, and the importance of El Carmen initiative are of paramount significance. The world is in need of more protected places that provide valuable ecosystem services,",

        "page_content": "and likewise have key educational value. The planet needs more people and organizations like CEMEX with a clear understanding of the importance of nature for our species survival and with a proven active role in promoting this understanding and acting consequently.\n\nThe Panel feels that there are further opportunities for CEMEX to do more, by working with other stakeholders at a landscape level, to mitigate risk, and bring capture opportunities, and to achieve integrated management of water, carbon, biodiversity, ecosystem services - and sustainable production.\n\n## Working Conditions\n\nThe Panel acknowledges CEMEX's commitment to building a truly diverse team and workplace through the global Workplace Diversity and Inclusion Policy. We also recognize the creation of the Diversity Committees in the different business units, and the training of personnel on non-discrimination policies and on how to identify and report discrimination issues. These initiatives will help in the implementation of the company's strategy, and to address \"Employee diversity and inclusion,\" which was identified as high risk in the materiality assessment. The Panel encourages CEMEX top management to continue efforts to become a more inclusive and gender diverse company.\n\nRegarding work-life balance, the panel celebrates the 500 initiatives the company rolled out in this area, benefitting employees across all business units. We are also pleased that CEMEX University quickly adapted and developed online learning experience as part of the response to COVID-19 and introduced relevant content to the new working conditions. For next year's report, the Panel recommends including more detailed data on how many employees are trained in each area of knowledge offered by the University.\n\n## Human Rights and Ethics\n\nThe report shows that CEMEX has continued strengthening the implementation of its Human Rights Policy wherever the company operates, following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including Human Rights in both the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.\n\nThe Panel underlines the actions taken to strengthen the code of ethics, policies, measures, and mechanisms aimed at consolidating a culture of integrity in the company. In addition, we recognize the actions undertaken to communicate these instruments and train more than 26,000 employees. The Panel encourages further progress in this and recommends systematically analyzing the challenges and achievements at the highest management level of the company. Strengthening a culture of integrity is critical to the growth, competitiveness, and durability of every business.\n\nFor next year's report, the panel recommends including information on trends and the nature of cases and disciplinary actions taken in response to a violation of the code of ethics. This would allow evaluation of the severity of the problems, progress made in their prevention, and the impacts generated on the business itself.\n\n## Supply Chain Management\n\nThe Panel acknowledges the CEMEX Global Procurement Model, which has helped the company to align suppliers to the core values of CEMEX, especially on health and safety, innovation-driven culture, the pursuit of excellence, and compliance with the CEMEX Code of Ethics and Conduct. We also recognize how, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company maintained effective communication with its suppliers.\n\nEven though CEMEX has been progressing on assessing suppliers' compliance with the company's standards, the Panel cautions that the strategy for supply chain sustainability is not strong enough and could pose a risk for the company, especially during the ongoing global pandemic where supply chains are a key risk for many companies. The Panel sees that in setting a goal of assessing the sustainability practices of only 80% of critical suppliers by 2030, CEMEX will be hard-pressed to be able to make claims for its own products.\n\n## Social Impact\n\nThe Panel deeply values the stated goal of developing community engagement plans through dialogue in 100% of prioritized locations. We continue to encourage the company to complement this with an objective aimed at measuring the impacts and benefits of the social actions\n\ncarried out by CEMEX in the vicinities in which its various operations are located. Measuring benefited people shows the coverage of actions but does not adequately convey the full impact CEMEX generates.\n\nMoreover, the Panel would like to stress that the thematic focus chosen and addressed by CEMEX's Social Impact strategy over the past several years becomes even more important in the face of the challenges of the postCOVID-19 world. Strengthening local education systems and creating better learning conditions, building skills and opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship with a focus on young people and women; these are some of the most momentous issues by which the company can contribute to social and economic revitalization in its operating environments over the next few years.\n\nThe main risks facing the company are well-identified from various perspectives. The Panel would like to note that the spaces for dialogue with the community and other actors, which CEMEX has created through the ECPs, are a relevant means of mitigating the risks of social instability and political uncertainty.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\nThe Panel praises CEMEX for the excellent strategy and performance described in the 2020 Integrated Report that clearly shows the company's efforts at the top management to integrate sustainability into the core business, during a very challenging year. This is especially important given that COVID-19 has created new opportunities for sustainable products and accelerated the rate of change in the building sector. It is encouraging to see that CEMEX has the ambition, the culture, and the innovative materials to be a key player under this new scenario.\n\nWe wish CEMEX every success and remain grateful for the opportunity to offer our recommendations, which we do with the sole purpose of supporting CEMEX in achieving its shared mission to build a better future for its stakeholders.",
