The invasion of Ukraine and Russia's weaponisation of energy brought a deep crisis to a system already in imbalance. It became apparent that security of supply in Europe rests on reliable access to natural gas. The war continues to impact society and peoples' lives. As part of an aligned response to the invasion, Equinor decided on 27 February 2022 to exit Russia.\n\nDuring last year, the e/ffects of global climate change proved the strong need to act on the goals in the Paris agreement. The energy sector must innovate to cut emissions and create low-carbon energy systems. We must accelerate investments in renewables, energy e/fficiency, and in low-carbon solutions to decarbonise industry and society. But to safeguard a just and inclusive change of the energy system, we must secure access to a/ffordable and reliable energy. In this context, Equinor is well positioned, as we focus on providing the energy the world needs while reducing emissions from our own operations and investing in the necessary systemic change towards net zero.\n\nGeopolitical developments call for a balanced energy transition. More investments in energy production and infrastructure are needed to reduce the cost of energy, and security of supply and decarbonisation of the sector will be required. Enabling such a transition calls for longevity and stability of frame conditions. Even\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nwithin the most ambitious goals of the Paris agreement and the net-zero scenario of the International Energy Agency, there will still be a need for oil and gas in the 2050 energy mix. A substantial part of the remaining demand will stem from the need for feedstock for industry and consumer goods to a global population of around 10 billion people. Low-carbon hydrogen produced from gas has the potential to become an important source of energy in the future. Equinor's Energy transition plan, supported by 97.5 percent of our shareholders at the annual general meeting in May 2022, outlines how Equinor will aim to deliver on its ambition to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nIn 2022, when it was more important than ever, people working for Equinor stepped up to deliver safe, secure, and reliable production with low emissions. The serious incident frequency for the company in 2022 was 0.4 per million hours worked, a slight improvement from the previous year, and the lowest frequency ever recorded. We progressed our emissions reduction (scope 1 and 2) by reaching a decline of 31 percent since 2015, taking us towards our ambition of net 50 percent reduction by 2030. In 2022, we also signed the world's first commercial agreement on cross-border CO 2 transportation and storage together with the joint venture partners in the Northern Lights project.\n\nDuring the year, we have reached key milestones to deliver on our strategy through strong project execution.

Peregrino phase 2 in Brazil came on stream in October, adding 250-300 million barrels while halving expected CO 2 emissions per barrel over the field's remaining lifetime. We generated first power at Hywind Tampen, the world's first floating wind farm to power o/ffshore oil and gas platforms. Further, we matured our renewables project portfolio, and won new o/ffshore wind leases. We aim to emerge as a leading energy player in selected international markets.\n\nTogether with partners, suppliers, and authorities, we managed to increase our gas supply to Europe by 8 percent compared to 2021. In total we produced around 2 million boe per day, and 2.7 terawatt hours of power. The CO 2 intensity of our production ended at 6.9 kg CO 2 per boe, far below the global average. Our unit production cost for oil and gas was USD 6 per barrel, confirming continued cost control. With cost inflation and continued supply chain disruption, we focus on maintaining cost competitiveness through the cycles.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the energy crisis in Europe natural gas prices rose to levels previously unseen. Our performance and focus on high production and stable delivery of oil and gas throughout the year resulted in high net operating income of USD 79 billion. This enabled us to maintain competitive shareholder returns, increasing the dividends and share buybacks during the year. At the capital markets update in February 2023, we announced a step-up in the capital distribution. We proposed a 50 percent increase in the ordinary cash dividend for the fourth quarter, to 30 cents per share. In combination with extraordinary dividend and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nshare buy-back, we expect a total distribution in 2023 of USD 17 billion. In 2022, Equinor also contributed with USD 42.8 billion in taxes from operations on the Norwegian continental shelf. After costs, taxes, and capital distribution our free cash flow* ended at USD 23.4 billion.\n\nEquinor's strong performance and results put the company in a robust financial position. We continue to optimise the oil and gas portfolio, accelerate renewables, and develop low-carbon solutions to deliver on our strategy. The strong cash flow from our oil and gas business together with our robust balance sheet enable us to continue investing and innovating. We aim to develop and bundle energy services and products, build new value chains, and invest in infrastructure projects, while delivering healthy and competitive returns to our shareholders. With our gas reserves and existing infrastructure, we are uniquely positioned to develop low carbon value chains. In collaboration with governments, industry, and customers, we aim to build markets for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage to achieve necessary scale. Our strategy and portfolio of producing assets and projects position us well to be a leading company in the energy transition.\n\nEquinor is in a strong position to create value in the energy transition, by providing a/ffordable, low carbon and secure energy. In 2030 we aim to produce around 2 million barrels of oil and gas per day, and 35-60 TWh of power from renewables annually. In addition, we are developing capacity for energy storage through batteries and green hydrogen, as well as blue hydrogen and carbon transport and storage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe would like to express appreciation of our employees' strong performance under extraordinary circumstances in 2022. We would also like to thank Equinor's shareholders for their continued investment, and our stakeholders for a strong commitment.\n\nJon Erik Reinhardsen, chair of the board Anders Opedal, president and CEO",

        "page_content": "## /ffflfifl2/ff01311 Equinor's Energy transition plan\n\n## Progress on our Energy transition plan in 2022\n\nEquinor is making progress on the Energy transition plan that was launched in May 2022. We moved in a positive direction across each of the three main dimensions of the plan: reduction in our operated emissions; allocation of capex share to investments in renewables and low-carbon solutions (gross capex*); and reduction in the carbon intensity of energy we provide. We also took steps to operationalise our commitment to a just and inclusive transition, and to implement our biodiversity position.\n\n## Reduction in our operated emissions\n\nOur ambition is to reduce emissions from our own operations by net 50% by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. We aim for at least 90% of this ambition to be realised by absolute reductions. In 2022, we made significant progress towards this ambition. Our total scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2022 were 11.4 million tonnes CO 2 e, compared to 12.1 million tonnes CO 2 e in 2021. In total, our operated emissions are now 31% lower than in 2015, the baseline year.\n\nWe continued our industry leading performance on CO 2 intensity and methane. Equinor's upstream CO 2 intensity was 6.9kg CO\u2082/boe in 2022. This is an improvement from 7.0kg CO\u2082/boe in 2021, well below the target of 8.0kg CO\u2082/boe in 2025, and on track\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n/ffflfi2fl0113fi435603740fl2835fl941 5 fi43\u2082\u011994\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "towards the ambition of 6kg CO\u2082/boe in 2030. The average methane intensity of our operated assets in 2022 remained unchanged from the 2021 level at 0.02% - around one tenth of the OGCI (Oil and Gas Climate Initiative) industry average of 0.2%.\n\n## Capex share to transition investments\n\nEquinor's ambition is to allocate more than 50% of our annual gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions by 2030 and more than 30% in 2025. In 2022 we invested 14% of our gross capex* into these areas, which is an increase of 3% compared to 2021.\n\n## Progress towards net zero\n\nOur ambition is to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy we provide by 20% by 2030. This ambition includes scope 3 emissions from the use of our products. In 2022, we saw a slight decrease in NCI due to two factors: an increase in the ratio of gas to oil in our production portfolio as well as a slight decrease in overall oil and gas production. The NCI of the energy we provided in 2022 was 66.5g CO\u2082e/ MJ, which is 1% lower than in 2021 and a 2% decrease relative to the 2019 baseline year. The 2% reduction in NCI from the 2019 baseline is in line with expectations. As deployment of renewable and CCS accelerates in the coming years, we expect to see greater progress in NCI reductions, with the majority of progress towards the 20% reduction ambition by 2030 expected in the second half of this decade. Lower overall oil and gas production resulted in a year-on-year decrease in absolute scope 3 emissions from 249 million tonnes in 2021 to 243 million tonnes in 2022.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## /ff fl fi fl2/ff013 11\n\n## /ffflfi2 0fi1345fl6678 77\n\n/ffflfi20/ff13fl4/ff 5/ff62327891\n\n## 2022 status and performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Production: 2,039 mboe/day\n- \u00b7  S1+2 emissions: 11.4 million tonnes  CO\u2082\n- \u00b7  Upstream CO\u2082 intensity: 6.9 kg CO\u2082/boe\n- \u00b7  Methane intensity: 0.02%\n- \u00b7  Emission reduction measures: 0.6 million tonnes\n- \u00b7  Start up of Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 & Peregrino Phase 2\n- \u00b7  Start up of gas import project to reduce emissions at Peregrino\n- \u00b7  First power from Hywind Tampen floating wind farm to Gullfaks A\n- \u00b7  Installation of heat recovery unit at Statfjord B\n- \u00b7  Development plans submitted for Irpa gas field tieback and Munin field with power from shore\n- \u00b7  Hammerfest LNG brought back into production\n- \u00b7  Electrification plan submitted for Njord A field and Njord Bravo FSO\n- \u00b7  Sn\u00f8hvit Future plan submitted for electrification of Hammerfest LNG and Sn\u00f8hvit onshore compression\n- \u00b7  Exited Russia joint ventures\n- \u00b7  Net 50% scope 1&2 GHG emissions reduction by 2030\n- \u00b7  Upstream CO\u2082 intensity:\n- \u00b7  < 8kg CO\u2082/boe by 2025\n- \u00b7  ~6 kg CO\u2082/boe by 2030\n- \u00b7  Installed capacity equity share: 0.6 GW\n- \u00b7 CO 2 storage: 0.5 million tonnes\n- \u00b7  Energy production: 1,649 GWh\n\n## 14% annual gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions\n\n- \u00b7  First power production at Hywind Tampen floating wind farm\n- \u00b7  Acquired US-based battery storage company East Point Energy\n- \u00b7  Installed first foundation at Dogger Bank, the world's largest o/ffshore wind farm\n- \u00b7  Completed construction of St\u0119pie\u0144, a 58 MW solar power plant in Poland\n- \u00b7  Signed agreement to buy BeGreen, a leading solar developer\n- \u00b7  Won first auction for floating wind project in California\n- \u00b7  Started construction at Mendubim, a 531 MW solar project in Brazil\n- \u00b7  12-16 GW installed capacity by 2030\n- \u00b7  CO\u2082 transport and storage capacity:\n- \u00b7  5-10 million tonnes annually by 2030\n- \u00b7  15-30 million tonnes annually by 2035\n- \u00b7  Reduce maritime emissions by 50% in Norway by 2030\n- \u00b7  Supply hydrogen to 3-5 major industrial clusters by 2035\n\n>30% annual gross capex*, >40% R&D expenditure, >50% venture capex towards renewables and low carbon solutions by 2025\n\n>50% annual gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions by 2030\n\n- \u00b7  Awarded operatorship for Smeaheia CO\u2082 storage licence\n- \u00b7  Awarded licences by UK government to store CO\u2082 under the UK North Sea\n- \u00b7  Agreed with Fluxys and Wintershall to develop major CO\u2082 infrastructure transport projects\n- \u00b7  Signed the world's first commercial deal for cross border CO\u2082 transport\n- \u00b7  H2H Saltend wins UK government support to progress to next round\n- \u00b7  Signed agreement with Centrica to explore development of hydrogen hub in eastern UK\n- \u00b7  MOU with Verdane on BECCS value chain\n- \u00b7  Launched project with VNG to cooperate on hydrogen, ammonia and CCS",

        "page_content": "The changed energy security situation in Europe has resulted in both positive and negative drivers for Equinor's energy transition. Increased demand for oil and, particularly, natural gas has highlighted the need for continued production of and investment in hydrocarbons, while increased policy support for renewables and low-carbon solutions are likely to accelerate their deployment in both Europe and the US. Equinor's ability to deliver on its transition ambitions and its net 2050 ambition will continue to be dependent on enabling policy and regulatory frameworks.\n\n## Just transition for people and net-positive impact for nature\n\nWe recognise that a successful energy transition must take into account its impact on people and nature. In 2022, we launched our Just transition approach, which lays out five foundational principles to enable us to have a positive impact on the societies in which we operate, including: respect for human rights; transparency in our financial reporting and advocacy; preparing our workforce for the future; enabling sustainable supply chains; and bringing resilience to local communities. Examples of how we work to promote a just energy transition in practice can be found on equinor.com. In addition, we continued to implement our biodiversity position, going beyond the do-no-harm principle to contributing to net-positive impact, and to promote and engage on biodiversity and nature across internal and external initiatives.\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nEquinor's oil and gas production was 2,039 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) in 2022, a marginal decrease compared to 2,079 mboe/d in 2021. The main drivers of our 6% reduction in operated scope\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n1 and 2 emissions were a combination of operational and portfolio measures including: divestment of our Kalundborg refinery and Bakken asset; modifications and emissions reduction initiatives at our onshore plants at Mongstad and K\u00e5rst\u00f8; and a change in strategy at several of our NCS assets from gas injection to gas exports to maximise supplies to Europe.\n\nWhile the resumption of production from the Peregrino asset added emissions to our operated portfolio in 2022 relative to 2021, the implementation of a gas import solution for Peregrino in September 2022 will halve the upstream carbon intensity of the asset and avoid around 100,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions per year. Meanwhile, Hywind Tampen, the world's first floating wind farm to supply power to o/ffshore oil and gas platforms, represents an innovative step forward, and is set to reduce CO\u2082 emissions by 200,000 tonnes a year when the project is fully operational in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, Equinor also submitted development plans for several large abatement projects, including Sn\u00f8hvit Future, which is intended to electrify the Hammerfest LNG facility and provide electric compressors for the Sn\u00f8hvit gas and condensate field, delivering an estimated CO\u2082 reduction of 850,000 tonnes per year; and Njord A electrification, which will result in a reduction of 130,000 tonnes per year. As outlined in our Energy transition plan, rapid reductions in operated emissions from oil and gas in Norway depend on the availability of, and access to, low-carbon electricity supplies as well as enabling permitting and fiscal regimes.\n\n## Renewables\n\nIn 2022, Equinor's installed renewable capacity was 0.6 GW (equity share) and renewable energy production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwas 1,649 GWh, an increase on both metrics compared to 0.5 GW and 1,562 GWh in 2021. We saw the first foundations being laid at the Dogger Bank o/ffshore wind farm in the UK and completed the St\u0119pie\u0144 solar project in Poland. In addition, Equinor was selected as a provisional winner of a lease area on the California Pacific outer continental shelf, one of the world's most attractive growth regions for o/ffshore wind; and we acquired BeGreen, a Danish solar developer with a strong project pipeline.\n\n## Low carbon solutions\n\nIn 2022, Equinor stored 0.5 million tonnes of CO\u2082, increased from 0.3 million tonnes in 2021. Accumulated, Equinor has stored 26.3 million tonnes of CO\u2082 since 1996.\n\nFor our low-carbon solutions business, 2022 was a year of continued progress in developing the value chains that will enable hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) to be key enablers in the transition. We announced the world's first commercial agreement on cross-border CO\u2082 transportation and storage between the Northern Lights partnership and the fertiliser company Yara.

Our purpose is to turn natural resources into energy for people, and progress for society . Our values open, courageous, collaborative and caring - guide our decisions and how we engage with each other, our partners, and the societies in which we operate.\n\nWe are the largest supplier of energy to Europe, a world-leading o/ffshore operator, the largest oil and gas operator in Norway, and an international pioneer in renewables and low-carbon solutions. Today, in an increasingly unpredictable world, our deliveries of oil, gas and wind power provide a vital and stabilising contribution to Europe's energy security, both in the short and long term.\n\nWe support the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the importance of contributing to resolving the world's energy trilemma of security, a/ffordability, and climate change. We support the Paris agreement and aim to become a net-zero company by 2050. We combine industrial strength with innovative thinking, expertise, and collaboration, enabling us to play a meaningful role in the global energy transition.\n\nOur Energy transition plan was approved by the annual general meeting (AGM) in May 2022. It charts our course towards achieving our net zero ambition through short-term actions and medium-term\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nambitions, showing that we have the strategy, ambition, capabilities, and track record to achieve them.\n\nWe are publishing our first integrated annual report, combining financial and sustainability (ESG) reporting. The AGM also endorsed an amendment to our objectclause to reflect our direction as a broad energy company.\n\nAlongside our net zero ambition, we will remain a reliable energy supplier and ensure long-term value creation for our shareholders. We have access to key suppliers, markets, systems, technology, and policymakers. For decades, we have played a unique role in shaping energy systems across Europe through partnerships with governments, society, and businesses.\n\nOur vision -shaping the future of energy - sets a clear direction. Future energy systems must di/ffer substantially from current systems, and the energy industry has the expertise and resources to change them.\n\nOur oil and gas production emissions are already among the lowest in the industry. By 2030, our ambition is to reduce CO\u2082 emissions from our own oil and gas operations by 50% from the reference year 2015, as well as allocate more than 50% of annual gross investments* to renewables and low-carbon solutions.\n\nTo transform the energy system, we must make substantial investments-and quickly-in new solutions.\n\nWe have defined four key areas in which we are well qualified to succeed and set clear ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas: Decarbonise and maintain value creation\n- \u00b7 O/ffshore wind: Industrialise and upscale\n- \u00b7 Carbon capture and storage (CCS): Industrialise and commercialise\n- \u00b7 Hydrogen: Scale up production and develop new value chains\n\nThere are clear synergies between our expertise from existing onshore operations and a future CCS and hydrogen portfolio. The extent of our engagement is demonstrated by our proactive participation in Northern Lights, Norway Energy Hub, Clean Hydrogen to Europe (CHE), H2H (Hydrogen to Humber) Saltend, Hywind Tampen and Sn\u00f8hvit future.\n\nEven in the most optimistic future scenarios for the energy transition, the world will remain dependent on oil and gas for energy and petrochemicals for decades to come. Therefore, it is important that the hydrocarbon resources produced are produced with the lowest carbon footprint possible.\n\nIn the years ahead, we will develop new value chains with suppliers, customers and authorities. We believe that industrial scale, innovation and technology development hold the key to the energy transition. However, the scale of the task means that achieving it will depend on the foresight and wisdom of leaders, policymakers, science and industry combined.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Our History\n\n## 18 SEPTEMBER 1972\n\nEquinor, formerly Statoil, was formed by a decision of the Norwegian parliament and incorporated as a limited liability company under the name Den norske stats oljeselskap AS. At the time owned 100% by the Norwegian State, Equinor's initial role was to be the government's commercial instrument in the development of the oil and gas industry in Norway. Growing in parallel with the Norwegian oil and gas industry, Equinor's operations were primarily focused on exploration, development and production of oil and gas on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS).\n\n## 1979 - 1981\n\nThe Statfjord field was discovered in the North Sea and commenced production. In 1981 Equinor, then called Statoil, was the first Norwegian company to be given operatorship of a field, at Gullfaks in the North Sea.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## 1980S AND 1990S\n\nEquinor grew substantially through the development of the NCS (Statfjord, Gullfaks, Oseberg, Troll and others). In the 1990s, Equinor started to grow internationally, becoming a major player in the European gas market by entering into large sales contracts for the development and operation of gas transport systems and terminals. During these decades, Equinor was also involved in manufacturing and marketing in Scandinavia and established a comprehensive network of service stations. This line of business was fully divested in 2012.\n\n## 2001\n\nEquinor was listed on the Oslo and New York stock exchanges and became a public limited company under the name Statoil ASA, now Equinor ASA, with a 67% majority stake owned by the Norwegian State.\n\n## 2007 - 2017\n\nEquinor's ability to fully realise the potential of the NCS and grow internationally was strengthened through the merger with Norsk Hydro's oil and gas division on 1 October 2007. Equinor's business grew as a result of substantial investments on the NCS and internationally. Equinor delivered the world's longest multiphase pipelines on the Ormen Lange and Sn\u00f8hvit gas fields, and the giant Ormen Lange development project was completed in 2007.\n\nBy 2007, Equinor had expanded into Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Nigeria, UK, and the US Gulf of Mexico, amongst others.\n\n## 2017 - 2019\n\nStatoil ASA changed its name to Equinor ASA, following approval of the name change by the company's annual general meeting on 15 May 2018. The name supports\n\nthe company's strategy and development as a broad energy company in addition to reflecting Equinor's evolution and identity as a company for the generations to come.\n\nThe Johan Sverdrup field came on stream in October 2019. It is powered by electricity from shore, making it one of the most carbone/fficient fields worldwide.\n\n## 2020 - 2021\n\nEquinor sets an ambition be a leading company in the energy transition and to become a netzero company by 2050 , including\n\nShaping the future of energy\n\n50\n\nyears experience o/ffshore Oil & Gas\n\n25\n\nyears experience from Carbon capture and storage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyears since Hywind floating wind concept\n\nyears since H\u2082 hydrogen concept\n\nemissions from production to final energy consumption.\n\nEquinor announced changes to the reporting segments, corporate structure and the corporate executive committee (CEC) to further strengthen its ability to deliver on the always safe, high value, low-carbon strategy. The changes will support improved value creation from Equinor's world-class oil and gas portfolio, accelerated profitable growth within renewables and the development of low-carbon solutions.\n\nIn January 2021, civil works began at the Northern Lights\n\nIntegrating five\n\ndecades of advances ...\n\n15\n\n5\n\nyears digital acceleration\n\ndevelopment for carbon transport and storage. In June 2021, the final investment decision was made for the first phase of the development of the Bacalhau field. The Martin Linge field was brought on stream in June 2021, driven by electric power from shore. The third phase of the Troll field development came on stream in August 2021, producing from the Troll West gas cap. The electrification of Troll West is underway. In November 2021, the decision was made to develop the third phase of the Dogger Bank o/ffshore windfarm. To meet growing demand, Equinor scaled up gas production from the NCS in 2021.\n\n2030\n\nAmbitions of 50% GHG emissions reduction (S1+2) & >50% share of annual gross capex to renewables and low carbon solutions\n\n2040\n\nAmbition to become hydrogen and CCS leader\n\nAim to transform to a net-zero company\n\n... to enhance competitive advantage for the future\n\n2050",

Our portfolio of projects encompasses oil and gas, renewables, hydrogen and low-carbon solutions, with an ambition of becoming a net-zero energy company by 2050.\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nEquinor produces around two million barrels of oil equivalent daily and is responsible for about 70% of Norwegian oil and gas production. In 2022, Equinor's activity outside Norway accounted for around onethird of the company's total oil and gas production, and this is expected to increase. The Peregrino field in Brazil and the Mariner field in the UK are our largest operatorships outside Norway.\n\n## Refining, processing and marketing\n\nOur refinery, processing plants and terminals transform crude oil and natural gas into everyday commodities such as petrol, diesel, heating oil and consumer-ready natural gas. Transportation and marketing, and trading of our products maximise value creation. Most of our products are exported from Norway to continental Europe, but we also export to the UK, North America and Asia.\n\nEquinor also markets and sells the Norwegian State's share of natural gas and crude produced on the NCS.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Where we are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nEquinor provides more than one million European homes with renewable power from o/ffshore wind farms in the UK and Germany. We develop some of the world's largest o/ffshore wind farms in Europe and the US and are in the process of building a solar portfolio through partnerships in energy farms in Argentina and Brazil and wholly owned subsidiaries in Denmark and Poland. By 2030, we aim to have grown our installed renewables capacity (equity-based) from 2022's 0.6 GW to 12-16 GW and produce 35-60 TWh annually.\n\n## Carbon capture and storage\n\nEquinor is pursuing new business models to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) viable. We have 25 years of operational experience from CCS, and more than 15 years of experience from technology development within large-scale hydrogen value chains including transport and CCS. Together with our joint venture partners we are developing the Northern Lights infrastructure for transportation and storage of CO\u2082. The project is part of the Norwegian government's project for full-scale carbon capture, transportation and storage in Norway.",

The cessation of importing energy from Russia to Europe and an increased focus on energy security and a/ffordability resulted in Equinor becoming the largest gas supplier to Europe in 2022.\n\nAlthough the Russian and Ukrainian economies were small in a world context, they played an influential role in energy and commodity markets. Many European economies relied upon Russian energy and trade links, and rising prices suppressed economic activity, despite support schemes. The US economy was more sheltered from the fallout but is increasingly impacted by elevated inflation, rising interest rates and weaker global demand. The zero-Covid policy in China persisted for most of the year, hampering recovery in domestic activity.\n\nAs we enter 2023, the world economy is teetering on the brink of recession, with several regions facing periods of negative growth 1 . A cost of living crisis is\n\nmaterialising as higher energy prices and inflation are met by further fiscal tightening and higher interest rates. The outlook still has downside risks, including a potential worsening of the European security situation, a deepening energy crisis, a failure to curb inflation, and uncertainty over Chinese growth.\n\n## Oil prices\n\nThe key oil price marker for Europe, dated Brent crude, began 2022 at just below 80 USD/bbl, rising towards 100 USD/bbl in a tight market before the invasion of Ukraine and peaking at 137 USD/bbl on 8 March, as several countries and companies introduced voluntary cuts on purchases of Russian crude oil.\n\nWhen the member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreed to release strategic supplies in storage, and the US followed suit, prices fell to around 100 USD/bbl. However, US and EU bans on Russian oil products led to a new price hike, with oil reaching almost 133 USD/bbl on 14 June.\n\nPrices subsequently declined slowly, reaching a low of 77 USD/bbl in early December due to fears of lower industrial activity caused by gas shortages, inflation and higher interest rates. Market players weighed the risk",

        "page_content": "that oil demand would fall below even the constrained oil supply, a discussion still ongoing at year-end since the results of fiscal measures may only be seen in Q1 2023. The price drop was also driven by paper market e/ffects, as higher price volatility led to higher margin calls. Notably, sanctions on Russian exports of refined products led to exceptionally high refinery margins, so our standard margin for an upgraded refinery in Europe averaged 21.2 USD/bbl for 2022, compared to 4.6 USD/bbl in 2021.\n\n## Natural gas prices and European electricity and CO 2 prices\n\n## Gas prices - Europe\n\nEuropean natural gas prices rose by around 135% year-on-year in 2022, having reached an all-time high of around 90 USD/MMBtu in August, with Russian flows curtailed by roughly 75 Bcm year-on-year. LNG imports played a major role in replacing lost Russian flows, increasing by almost 70% year-on-year. Security of supply measures regained focus, with countries working to bring new LNG import capacity online and filling storage capacity ahead of the winter season. Additional pipeline supplies were seen from Norway and Azerbaijan. High prices and mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted in sharp declines in residential and industrial demand. The European Commission also proposed a series of emergency interventions during the year to limit the e/ffect of\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nhigh energy prices, such as windfall taxes, joint gas purchases, and a market correction mechanism to cap Dutch TTF hub prices.\n\n## Gas prices - North America\n\nThe Henry Hub spot price averaged 6.4 USD/MMBtu for the year, a jump from the 3.9 USD/MMBtu average in 2021. Strong domestic demand and LNG export outpaced production growth for the year. Producers continued to prioritise capital discipline rather than unchecked production growth. Gas rig activity levels finally returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2022, and meaningful production growth started to materialise towards year-end. On the demand side, record heat waves across the country supported high power demand throughout the summer. US LNG exports grew by ~15% year-on-year, from 110 to 127 bcm, despite the Freeport LNG terminal being o/ffline for half a year. Extremely high international gas prices drove terminal utilisation up and exports to record highs.\n\n## Global LNG prices\n\nGlobal LNG spot prices were highly volatile in 2022, with the Asian LNG price ranging from 18.9 USD/mmBtu to 84.8 USD/mmBtu. The average Asian LNG spot price increased from 18.4 USD/mmBtu in 2021 to 34 USD/ mmBtu in 2022, driven by a surge in LNG demand in Europe. Europe su/ffered from congestion at LNG regasification terminals and pipeline infrastructure connecting end markets, limiting the inflow of gas to high-demand areas, such as Germany. This resulted\n\nin large price di/fferentials between LNG delivered to Northwestern Europe and the Dutch TTF hub price, which reached a record 29.6 USD/mmBtu in early October. These bottlenecks eased going into 2023, with several floating LNG terminals swiftly deployed on the continent and enhancements made to pipeline infrastructure. Gas demand declined in Asia due to high LNG prices and additionally in China due to Covid-19 lockdowns, which released LNG volumes for Europe.\n\n## European electric power and CO 2 prices\n\nPower prices in major West European markets (the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, and Italy) averaged 245 EUR/MWh in 2022, up 117% yearon-year. Although 2022 was expected to be a welcome end to the pandemic with an uptick in production and demand, the European security situation overshadowed everything. Power price volatility was extreme, and European governments intervened in regional markets to combat ever-rising prices.\n\nWhilst the EU ETS (CO 2 ) allowance price in 2021 saw a steady rise, the 2022 price was more volatile due to the introduction of emergency legislation in the energy market and uncertainty surrounding the Fit for 55-package and RePowerEU. Nevertheless, the price maintained a growth trend, with an average price of EUR 81/tCO 2 and a record high of EUR 98/ tCO 2 in August. Going forward, we expect the EU ETS allowance price to be driven by a persistent gas-tocoal switch due to a tight gas market and RePowerEU.\n\nAfter European power and natural gas prices reached an all-time high in August 2022, the EU agreed temporary, but extendable market intervention measures including a mandatory reduction in power consumption during peak hours and a 10% target for overall power demand reduction. Also agreed was an inframarginal revenue cap for power generators as well as a solidary fiscal contribution from the oil, gas, coal and refinery sectors with activities within the territory of the Union. Various industrial actors are pursuing legal challenges to these decisions. Regarding natural gas a temporary dynamic cap mechanism applicable to the TTF and extendable to other trading places if proposed by the European Commission was agreed. The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have in a recent report concluded that no significant impacts (positive or negative) on prices can be unequivocally and directly attributed to the adoption of this mechanism. However, both regulators indicate that this situation could change if prices rise and the prospect of the cap being triggered comes into view. The European Commission has also initiated the preparation of a targeted electricity market reform and this proposal is expected for medio March 2023. Member States remain split both in terms of the scope and timing of such a reform e/ffort.",

In this context, our strategic beliefs stand firm with climate change being a key challenge. The world's energy systems are in transition to meet this challenge.\n\nAs Equinor transforms, we work towards striking the right balance between supporting our core, generating cash flow to enable the energy transition, growing business in new energy areas, and continuing as an attractive investment for our shareholders.\n\n## A leading company in the energy transition\n\nBy 2030, we aim to be a leading provider of renewable energy and low-carbon solutions, alongside our continued optimised oil and gas portfolio. We aim to continue being Norway's energy major and emerge as a leading energy player in select international markets.\n\nWe have developed a comprehensive Energy transition plan to become a net-zero company by 2050, including emissions from production and final consumption.\n\nIn 2030, our ambition is to have reduced the net carbon intensity by 20%, and by 40% in 2035. We aim to achieve this reduction by directing more than 50% of our annual gross investments in 2030 towards renewables and low-carbon solutions while continuing our e/fforts to reduce our emissions from the production of oil and gas.\n\nOver the next ten years, we aim to generate a substantial cash flow from oil and gas, as our operations on the NCS are expected to continue delivering positive cash flow at low prices, short payback times, leading breakevens and top quartile production cost, and among the lowest carbon intensity per barrel of oil. Internationally, the oil and gas portfolio will contribute significantly to after-tax cash flow as high-value development projects come onstream from the mid-2020s. The cash flow will be used to add to our portfolio, invest in our transition, and create value for shareholders and society.\n\nWe aim to accelerate growth in o/ffshore wind from a strong industrial position to being among the top global players.

Focusing on a high value growth in renewables both onshore and o/ffshore, Equinor's renewable portfolio will also contribute to significant value creation.\n\nEquinor is building a profitable renewables business, looking to increase returns through regional synergies, project financing, strategic farm downs, and inorganic growth. We seek to execute projects at scale, strive for technical improvements, and drive profits from energy trading. Equinor has a position of advantage in floating o/ffshore wind and seeks to reduce costs through industrial scale projects like Hywind Tampen. Through early access to less mature markets, where both the risk and the potential returns are higher, Equinor can build leadership positions. Equinor is continuously seeking business opportunities in select renewable markets onshore.\n\n## Our strategic pillars and material topics\n\n## High Value\n\nE/fficient and predictable operations Profitable portfolio Value creation for society Integrity and anti corruption\n\n## New Market Opportunities in Low Carbon Solutions\n\n- - becoming a leader in carbon management and hydrogen.\n\nLow carbon value chains will be critical to decarbonise the global economy. Equinor is uniquely positioned to become a leader in CCS and hydrogen in Europe. Equinor is actively contributing to maturing these markets and aims to achieve a leadership position in the European CCS market with a market share above 25%. We expect government subsidies to play a key role over the next decade with policy choices supporting the industry in developing markets for CCS and hydrogen. Equinor has a strong starting point on the NCS and in the UK. The company draws on 25 years of operational experience from CCS at Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit and decades of commercial partnerships with key industrial customers in Europe. Equinor is already a participant in leading projects to industrialise CCS and hydrogen like Northern Lights, Smeheia license and hydrogen clusters in the UK. Equinor is prepared to scale up investments and technologies as markets mature.\n\n## Low Carbon\n\nNet zero pathway Emission reduction",

As an international operator of exploration, project development, oil and gas production, refineries, gas plants, solar and wind farms, Equinor faces a range of potential safety and security risks.\n\nProtecting nature: Preventing the loss of biodiversity and enhancing the diversity and resilience of ecosystems in which Equinor operates. Being present in around 30 countries, Equinor's operating activities onshore and o/ffshore have actual or potential impacts on nature.\n\nE/fficient and predictable operations: Optimisation and management of operations, turnarounds, and technological innovation. Equinor's core business activity is energy provision for society, which relies on optimal operational performance. This is especially important in the current economic climate with tight energy supply and high demand.\n\nProfitable portfolio: Portfolio development and composition to ensure ongoing profitability with risk assessment and management of current asset base. Equinor operates a large global portfolio of assets across several energy resources. The composition and development of this portfolio influence our ability to ensure continued profitable business activity and long-term value to shareholders.\n\nNet zero pathway: Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including emissions from the use of our products. Equinor believes that a net zero pathway creates new business opportunities and is aligned with our purpose of delivering energy to people and progress for society.\n\nTackling inequality: Respecting and protecting human rights in Equinor's own activities and supply chain. Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace with equal opportunities and human capital development, and where discrimination is not tolerated in any form. Equinor employs a large and diverse workforce, with operations and supply chains in geographies with a high risk of human rights violations.\n\nValue creation for society: Generating revenue, job opportunities and economic well-being through local employment, procurement and taxes. Delivering value to society at large and to our host communities, in particular, is fundamental to the success of our ongoing business activities and the energy transition.\n\nIntegrity and anti-corruption: Preventing corruption and ensuring ethical business culture across the company. Equinor is a global company with a large number of business relationships and is present in parts of the world where corruption is a high risk.\n\nEmission reductions: Reducing GHG emissions from own production and the use of our products. Equinor has significant GHG emissions, and reducing emissions within this decade is urgent to be aligned with the Paris agreement.",

        "page_content": "## 1.6 Capital and liquidity management\n\n## Capital Distribution\n\nEquinor is ambitious to grow the annual cash dividend in line with long-term underlying earnings, in addition to buying back shares.\n\nWhen deciding the interim dividends and recommending the total annual dividend level, the BoD take into consideration a range of factors, including the macro environment, expected cash flow, capital expenditure plans, financing requirements and appropriate financial flexibility. Dividends are declared in USD. For further details on Equinor's dividend policy see section 5.1.\n\nAs part of our distribution of capital to shareholders, Equinor also buys back shares. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme are cancelled. According to a separate agreement between Equinor and the Norwegian State, a proportionate share of the Norwegian State's shares will be redeemed and annulled at the annual general meeting, ensuring that the State's ownership interest in Equinor remains unchanged at 67%. Execution of share buy-backs after the 2023 annual general meeting is subject to a renewed authorisation, including renewal of the agreement with the Norwegian State. Share buy-backs will be executed within applicable safe harbour provisions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nDuring the year we have increased our cash dividend from USD 0.20 ordinary dividend per share and USD 0.20 extraordinary dividend per share in the first quarter. The extraordinary dividend increased to USD 0.50 per share in the second quarter and to USD 0.70 per share in the third quarter.  For the fourth quarter of the year, the board proposes to the AGM an ordinary cash dividend of USD 0.30 per share, and an extraordinary quarterly dividend of USD 0.60 per share.\n\nFor 2022, Equinor initiated a USD 5,000 million share buy-back programme which was increased to USD 6,000 million later in the year. The 2022 share buy-back programme started with the first tranche in February 2022 and ended with the fourth tranche, which was completed in January 2023. The Norwegian State share related to the second, third and fourth tranches of the 2022 share buy-back programme and to the first tranche of the 2023 share buy-back programme, amounting to USD 4,020 million, will be redeemed in 2023. Redemption is subject to approval in the annual general meeting in May 2023.\n\n## Debt and credit rating\n\nEquinor generally seeks to establish financing at the corporate (top company) level. Loans or equity are then extended to subsidiaries to fund their capital requirements. Project financing may be used in cases\n\ninvolving incorporated joint ventures with other companies. The aim is to always have access to a variety of funding sources across di/fferent markets and instruments, as well as maintain relationships with a core group of international banks that provide a wide range of banking services.\n\nOur credit rating target is within the single A category on a stand-alone basis. This rating ensures access to relevant capital markets at favourable terms and conditions.\n\nThe Group's borrowing needs are usually covered through the issuance of short-, medium- and long-term securities, including utilisation of a US Commercial Paper Programme (programme limit USD 5.0 billion) and issuances under a Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC in the US and a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) Programme (programme limit EUR 20 billion) listed on the London Stock Exchange. In addition, Equinor has a multicurrency revolving credit facility of USD 6 billion, including a USD 3 billion swing line (same day value) option. The credit facility is used as a backstop for the group's US Commercial Paper Programme and has a sustainability linked financing element included in the loan agreement related to Equinor's CO 2 upstream intensity target. Equinor believes that given its current liquidity reserves, including the committed revolving credit facility of\n\nUSD 6 billion and its access to global capital markets, Equinor will have su/fficient funds available to meet its liquidity and working capital requirements.\n\nEquinor did not issue any new bonds in 2022 and 2021. The redemption profile of previously issued bonds by currency denomination is shown below. This includes bonds issued in the US and European bond markets. All the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by Equinor Energy AS. Equinor manages its interest rate exposure on it bond debt based on risk and reward considerations from an enterprise risk management perspective. This means that the fixed / floating mix on interest rate exposure may vary from time to time. After the e/ffect of currency swaps, the major part of Equinor's borrowings is in USD.\n\n## Long-term debt maturity profile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUSD\n\nEUR\n\nGBP\n\nNOK",

In addition, interest rate derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risk of the long-term debt portfolio.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, Equinor had a long-term credit rating of Aa2 (Moody's Investors Service) and AA- (Standard & Poor's Global Ratings), including an uplift due to state ownership (two notches from Moody's Investors Service and one notch from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings compared to their respective standalone credit rating assessments of Equinor). This rating is well above our rating target and ensures su/fficient predictability when it comes to funding access at attractive terms and conditions.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nEquinor diversifies its cash investments across a range of financial instruments and counterparties to avoid concentrating risk in any one type of investment or any single country. As of 31 December 2022, approximately 25% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in USDdenominated assets, 26% in NOK, 36% in EUR, 7% in SEK, 3% in DKK and 3% in GBP before the e/ffect of currency swaps and forward contracts. Approximately 31% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in time deposits, 37% in treasury bills and commercial papers, 11% in corporate bonds, 7% in money market funds and 0% in current accounts.

The interconnectivity and inter-dependency between these issues further require governments, civil society, and private sector entities such as Equinor to adopt integrated and holistic approaches. The way Equinor responds to these challenges is fundamental to our strategy and delivering on our purpose.\n\nIn 2022, Equinor made a strategic decision to further integrate sustainability priorities into the strategy and management of the company. We defined nine financial, operational, and sustainability-related topics that are critical to achieving our strategy; and we set ambitions for each topic to measure and report our progress to the board and our stakeholders in a coherent way (see chapter 2 for further details). From a sustainability perspective, Equinor has three overarching priorities: (i) Net zero by 2050; (ii) Evolving from a 'do no harm' principle to a nature-positive contribution; and (iii) Ensuring a just transition. Good governance and transparency are key enablers.\n\nAt both a strategic and operational level, we seek to embed these priorities into relevant governance, risk management and assurance, and decision-making processes. Alongside addressing these priorities in our own operations and projects, we seek to influence our partners and increasingly recognise the importance of\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n' Equinor aims to support sustainable development through contributing to the energy transition whilst also addressing biodiversity loss and the need for a just transition.'

We further recognise that external dialogue and collaboration are key to understanding and ensuring a relevant and long-lasting contribution.\n\nThe e/ffectiveness of our sustainability management approach is regularly evaluated through performance reviews at several levels, including the board of directors (BoD), the BoD's safety, sustainability and ethics committee (SSEC), the corporate executive committee (CEC), and by corporate functions and business areas. Internal and external audits, verifications and self-assessments constitute key assurance elements of our management approach. We conduct internal and external benchmarking and participate in external performance ratings for the same purpose.\n\nEquinor supports the UN SDGs and shares the view that business has a key role to play in delivering on and contributing to the goals. Equinor supports all the 17 SDGs and contributes especially to the following six goals: quality education, a/ffordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, climate action, life below water, and partnerships for the goals.\n\nOur sustainability reporting is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards\n\n(2021). The information provided is also aligned with the World Economic Forum Stakeholder Capitalism reporting metrics. The report, along with its referenced information, forms Equinor's Communication on Progress (CoP) to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\nIn alignment with industry practice and regulatory requirements, we report safety and environmental data under our operational control (100% basis), including operations where Equinor is a technical service provider. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data is reported on both an equity and operational control basis. Economic data is reported on an equity share basis, and workforce data covers employees in our direct employment. Human rights data is collected from operated and non-operated assets. Our transparency act disclosures can be found at equinor.com/report (ESG reporting centre). For more information about reporting boundaries, see section 5.6 Additional sustainability information.

Variable remuneration is aimed at driving performance in line with the company's strategy and securing long-term commitment and retention with the company. The receipt of variable remuneration depends on individual and company performance and is subject to a holding period requirement for some elements. Performance-based variable remuneration compensation has been capped in accordance with the relevant Norwegian state guidelines.\n\nThe remuneration policy was approved by the 2021 annual general meeting. A revised policy will be presented for a binding vote at the general meeting in 2023. The approved policy will be available on Equinor's website.\n\n## Executive remuneration policy\n\nThe executive remuneration policy approved by the 2021 annual general meeting, which serves as the basis for the 2022 remuneration report, including information with respect to the board of directors and corporate assembly, can be found in an appendix to the 2022 remuneration report on equinor.com/reports.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The most important enterprise risks and risk factors are described in section 5.2 Risk factors.\n\nEquinor's enterprise risk management (ERM) framework is integrated into all Equinor business activities with a focus on creating value and avoiding incidents. We consider risks related to shorter-term outcomes, as well as more immature or emerging risk issues that can impact our business ambitions and corporate risk profile. The Equinor BoD oversees the ERM framework and reviews company performance.\n\nThe ERM approach supports risk-informed decisions and optimal solutions through a focus on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the value impact for Equinor, including upside and downside risk; and\n- \u00b7 compliance with Equinor's requirements, including a strong focus on avoiding HSE, human rights and business integrity incidents (such as accidents, fraud and corruption).\n\nIn general, the risk is managed in the business line as an integral part of employee and manager tasks. The business areas and corporate functions regularly identify and evaluate risk using established procedures, assess the need for risk-adjusting actions, and review overall risk management performance. Some risks, such as oil and natural gas price risks and interest and currency risks, are managed at the corporate\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nlevel to provide optimal solutions. A corporate risk perspective is also applied in strategy development, portfolio prioritisation processes, and capital structure discussions. Equinor's corporate risk team analyses the corporate risk profile and maintains the ERM overview. Throughout the year, the CEO and the BoD maintain oversight of the risk management framework, processes, top enterprise risks and the overall risk picture. Areas of particular risk oversight currently include IT and cyber-security, progress on net-zero, low-carbon value proposition, political and regulatory frameworks, human rights, and capacity and capability constraints.\n\nEquinor's risk management process is based on ISO 31000 risk management and seeks to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, evaluated, and appropriately managed. A standardised process across Equinor supports consistency in risk discussions and e/fficiency in decisions. Risk is integrated into the company's management information system (IT tool), where it is linked with Equinor's purpose, vision and strategy and associated strategic objectives and KPIs. This tool is used to capture risks, follow up risk-adjusting actions and related assurance activities, and supports a risk-based approach in the context of a three lines-ofcontrol model (Equinor Book).\n\nEquinor risk management can be broadly considered across the following enterprise impact areas. More detail on specific themes is provided in relevant material topics sections of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate-related issues influence many aspects of our strategy selection and execution. Global, regional and national political developments can change the operating environment and economic outcomes. Market conditions related to supply and demand, technological change, customer preferences and global economic conditions can significantly impact company financial performance. Our ability to deliver value from projects and operations can be impacted by factors related to partners, contractors, global supply chains as well as regulatory frameworks. Digital and cyber threats are constantly evolving and can cause major disruption across our value chains.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risk management:\n\nOverall, Equinor manages risk through a diversified portfolio, robust financial framework, stress-testing and business planning, investment, and review processes. The company is exposed to oil and gas market price levels. Corporate hedges may be entered into to reduce or eliminate the cash flow volatility generated from the price levels risk. Equinor has an insurancebased approach to this hedging, securing downside protection only while keeping the upside in price exposure open. For the trading business, derivatives risk is managed though a control framework including Value at Risk and trader mandates, loss limitation systems and daily monitoring of trading profit and loss. Equinor's liquidity framework is based on a forward-looking risk management approach to assure that Equinor's\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nstrategic liquidity reserve will cover both expected and unexpected cash outflows over the subsequent six months, including a potential crisis event and significant collateral needs.\n\nRisk factors related to low carbon solutions, climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy, workforce and organisation, cyber security, actions by the Norwegian State are included within top enterprise risks and have direct follow-up at executive level.

Risks relating to policies and regulatory frameworks, international politics and geopolitical change, together with competition and technological innovation are regularly assessed, monitored and managed to improve outcomes for the company as part of the Equinor's risk update.\n\nRisk factors related to projects and operations are managed at many levels, including through quality assurance processes (competence area reviews, e.g., facilities, safety and security, environment, commercial and country risk) within the investment phase, quality risk management within the project execution risk phase, and continuous improvement programs in operations. Crisis management, business continuity and insurance coverage are included in the evaluation of actions to reduce the impact of unwanted incidents. Digital security and cybersecurity remain in high focus through a cybersecurity improvement programme to maintain and strengthen cybersecurity capability and reduce cyber risk.",

Each and every one of us makes a di/fference as we shape the future of energy.\n\nEquinor's role as a reliable energy provider is more important than ever, while we also work on securing sustainable energy production today that will enable the energy transition. This has resulted in a high activity level, and we are proud of all our people going to great lengths to keep energy production high and secure. In 2022, we strengthened our capabilities in Norway and in locations around the world, focusing on competence development, recruitment, and our operating model. In Equinor, we have around 22,000 employees globally. We work systematically with diversity and inclusion in our HR processes, from recruitment, talent, and succession to leadership deployment. In 2022, our gender balance was 31% female, and 21% of our employees were international (non-Norwegian). During the year we welcomed almost 2,000 new employees to our company. Our focus has been on strengthening competence development, recruitment, and onboarding\n\nwhile maintaining our people's well-being and building an inclusive culture where everyone feels respected, safe, and fully connected to our common goal.\n\n## Developing our people capabilities\n\nIn 2022, we implemented further improvements to our workforce planning process to ensure that there is an even stronger link between our strategy, business plans, and the people capabilities we develop for Equinor. Our workforce planning process involves leaders and employee representatives in the definition of the competence and capacity needed to deliver on future plans, as well as in the development of plans to close and mitigate gaps, such as competence development and recruitment.\n\n## Building and utilising our collective competence\n\nOur collective competence is a key enabler for Equinor to deliver on current and future ambitions. We are therefore supporting employees to build future-fit competence and are continuously updating our learning o/ffering. We continuously monitor the uptake of all formal learning to ensure management focus and further optimise our learning portfolio.\n\nEquinor Fornebu, Oslo, Norway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                     | Boundary      | Unit   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total number of permanent employees | Equinor group | number | 21,936 | 21,126 | 21,245 | 21,412 | 20,525 |\n| Total new hires                     | Equinor group | number | 1,988  | 886    | 774    | 1,568  | 905    |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022",

In 2022, we implemented further improvements to make sure that our processes and tools are fit for purpose to enable this, including a review of various IT solutions.\n\n## Growing our workforce\n\nTo support our ambitions for the future, we added almost 2,000 new recruits in 2022 to replenish and grow our workforce. A high activity level in our existing business, combined with high growth ambitions, and a growing number of retirees, requires an increased intake of both emerging talent and experienced hires.\n\n## Creating a great place to work\n\nIn Equinor, we continuously involve our people in the development of the company. This includes internal cross-functional collaboration and liaising with union representatives and safety delegates according to local law and practice. In 2022, this was vital in activating our new operating model, flexible work, humanitarian aid related to the war in Ukraine, and an increasingly complicated security situation. We respect employees' rights to organise and their opportunity to bring forward their opinions, and we have the same clear expectation of our suppliers and partners.\n\nEvery year we conduct a global people survey (GPS) to evaluate and improve key areas that impact safety, working environment, engagement, and the drive for continuous improvement and change in Equinor. For 2022, the GPS scores show a positive development\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nin commitment, motivation and HSE compared to 2021, but also some negative developments for some important topics, such as continuous improvement, rapid implementation of good ideas and further development of our operating model. We are focused on developing our people, directing their time and e/ffort to prioritised activities in more flexible ways. We continue to adapt to our new ways of working and our focus on flexibility and collaboration. In Equinor, we have established a set of flexible work principles that describe the ways we organise our work, use our facilities, and behave together, and 2022 was about implementing and operationalising these principles.\n\n## Performance and reward framework\n\nOur performance and reward framework measures progress and results in a holistic way across two dimensions, both by what we deliver and how we deliver. Business delivery and behaviour are equally weighted when recognising and rewarding individual performance. The CEO, his direct reports and Equinor's broader leadership are assessed based on results within a broad range of financial, operational and sustainability topics. The annual bonus for employees is based on the same holistic assessment of company performance. A comprehensive set of performance indicators and monitoring reports are made available to all employees in Equinor's management information system. The KPIs are reported on a regular basis from operational levels to the governing bodies to ensure transparency in risk and performance management - this is how we keep individuals accountable for the development of our company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is important to engage to enrich and challenge our priorities and positions, so that we can continuously improve our performance and strategic direction.\n\nThroughout 2022, we engaged with numerous stakeholders, including investors, governments, regulators, business partners and suppliers, customers, local communities, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organisations. Equinor strives to have a systematic approach to engage with a broad set of relevant stakeholders for our business and the communities where we operate.\n\nA tangible example of how we engage with stakeholders was the company's Energy transition plan. In May 2022, Equinor put forward its Energy transition plan for an advisory vote to shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM). The plan provides an overview of how the company is progressing towards its 2050 net-zero ambition through short-term actions and medium-term ambitions. This provided an opportunity for all investors to actively engage with the company's ambitions and performance. 97.5% of the votes representing shareholders present at the AGM were cast in approval of the proposed resolution. In addition to the government as the largest shareholder, almost three out of four investors voted in favour.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThe chair of the BoD, the CEO and senior managers, amongst others, regularly engage in stakeholder dialogues. We consult stakeholders both directly and indirectly, and we strive to reduce potential language, social and geographical barriers.\n\n## Associations and industry initiatives\n\nEquinor participates in a wide range of relevant associations and industry initiatives to engage in dialogue, share knowledge and learn from others. The following are some of the associations that worked closely with: CCSA, G+ Global o/ffshore wind health and safety organisation and Global Wind O/ffshore (GWO), Hydrogen UK, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), Ipieca, Methane Guiding Principles, O/ffshore Norge, Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), Oil and Gas Methane partnership, Renewable UK, Sustainability Hub Norway, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the Task Force on Nature related Financial Disclosures, United Nations Global Compact, Wind Europe, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.\n\nFurther information on our Climate policy engagement activities can be found in section 2.3 Low carbon.\n\n## Working with partners and suppliers\n\nEquinor holds participating interests in many assets operated by other companies. Similarly, other companies hold participating interests in assets that we operate. The way we work and follow up on partner-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperated assets seeks to ensure that governance, risk and performance management are compatible with our own requirements and practices. Through the applicable committee structures in the partnerships, we follow up and support the management of risks and performance related to safety, security, ethics, integrity, and sustainability, including climate, environment, human rights and social performance.\n\nA significant part of our business activities are carried out by suppliers working under contracts awarded by Equinor. We undertake safety and sustainability qualification of suppliers' management systems to ensure that our suppliers have an acceptable standard\n\nbefore entering into a contract. The qualification is based on an audit of suppliers' management system according to the main principles of ISO 9001 (quality), 14001 (environment), 27001 (information security) and 45001 (occupational health and safety), in addition to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We work closely with our suppliers and regularly verify deliveries to ensure that agreed actions are undertaken.\n\nIntegrity due diligence (IDD) is performed to identify integrity concerns and ensure that the required IDD process is complete prior to establishing a new agreement with a counterparty.",

We create value by providing society with energy - 2,039 mboe per day of oil and gas and a total of 2,653 GWh of electric power in 2022. Through the e/fficient operation of our portfolio, we generate profits and shareholder returns. This financial strength, combined with our engineering expertise, enables us to contribute to the rapid deployment of renewable energy and low-carbon solutions. We also contribute to socioeconomic development through jobs for around 22,000 employees and our 8,000 suppliers and pay a significant amount of tax in the societies in which we operate.\n\nAt the same time, our operations generate significant greenhouse gas emissions - in 2022 we emitted 11.4 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) from our own operations. We also impact biodiversity and ecosystems through for example discharges to sea or land, emissions to air, and the use of land and sea areas and natural resources. In our industry, the exposure to health and safety risk is high. Risks related to breaking of human rights, integrity and security are also inherent in the activities we and our suppliers perform. While profitable growth and shareholder value is critical to any business, we must create long-term growth and lasting value in a sustainable way.\n\nIn recognition of the complex interplay between our business, nature and society, we use the concept of double materiality to inform our business decisions. We\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nsystematically analyse impacts with two perspectives in mind: the impacts that Equinor has on society and nature, and the impacts that society and nature have on Equinor. This dual perspective ensures a broader understanding of the material topics we need to manage in the delivery of our long-term strategy as well as in our day-to-day operations. The identification and prioritisation of material topics is based on our understanding of relevant risk factors, consultation with internal and external subject matter experts, independent analyses and our ongoing stakeholder engagement as summarised in chapter 1. The chief executive o/fficer (CEO) and ultimately the board of directors (BoD) are responsible for the approval of the annual report, including the material topics, monitoring indicators and ambitions.\n\nThe material topics are grouped according to our three strategic pillars: Always safe, high value and low carbon. For each of the material topics, KPIs/monitoring indicators have been identified, and clear ambitions have been set. The table below summarises our framework and provides a high-level overview of our progress in 2022. Subsequent sections of this chapter detail our ambitions, key risk factors, management approach, performance data, and evaluation of our progress for each of the nine topics. For each material topic we include a summary of Equinor's key impacts to nature and society, as well as through cross referencing relevant corporate risk factors identified in chapter 1, an assessment of the impact of nature and society to Equinor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Summary of enterprise level material topics for 2022\n\n## Always safe Improved safety and security performance\n\nIn 2022 there were no fatalities and no actual or potential major accidents, and the total number of actual serious incidents is the lowest ever recorded. Equinor also recorded the lowest number of serious oil and gas leaks ever, and there was no significant harm to people, assets or operations due to security incidents. The company, however, experienced too many personal injuries and did not meet the 2022 target. Although there was a decline in work related illness, the total level of absence has increased further since 2021. Based on our 2022 performance, we recognise the need to continue to improve our health, safety and security performance. Given the measures reinforced in 2022, we consider our approach as adequate, and health, safety and security objectives remain a top priority for Equinor's management.\n\n## Satisfactory performance on most nature related topics\n\nEquinor's performance related to non-GHG emissions to air and regular discharges to sea, is considered satisfactory. Although volumes of accidental spills are lower than in 2021, we are not satisfied with the slight increase in number of uncontrolled discharges and breaches of discharge permits in our operations in Norway, and there is continued focus on improvement activities to address compliance with relevant environmental regulations. Our approach and ongoing improvement activities related to our impacts on\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nbiodiversity, for example new disclosure metrics and preparation of NPI plans and site-specific inventories of key biodiversity features, are viewed as representing an adequate response to the need for action against loss of biodiversity.\n\n## Further maturation of approach to human rights\n\nEquinor has continued to mature its approach to addressing human rights and tackling inequality with two important milestones in 2022 being the articulation of our just transition framework, and stand-alone human rights statement. We continued our e/fforts to further integrate human rights practices into the way we work, with a particular focus on addressing indications of forced labour and unacceptable working conditions in our supply chains. We consider our management approach adequate to address the salient risks but recognise the need for more systematic e/fforts and broader collaborations to tackle systemic issues. We will also continue our e/fforts to identify meaningful indicators of social and human rights performance with the aim of reporting in a more quantitative fashion in future years.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion performance satisfactory\n\nThe focus in 2022 has been on updating our diversity and inclusion (D&I) ambition, strategy and metrics to better support our business strategy, and reflect our external context, societal expectations and international reporting standards. While diversity targets have been put on hold in 2022 due to internal reorganisation, we continued to measure our inclusion index and use this data to identify actions that drive an inclusive culture. The inclusion index performance remains at the same level compared to a three-year\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "average, and we recognise the opportunities for improvement. The plans for 2023 focus on further operationalising D&I, setting targets and actions locally and systematically measuring progress on both diversity and inclusion.\n\n## High value E/fficient and predictable operations\n\nEquinor delivered stable equity liquids and gas production throughout 2022 at 2,039 mboe per day compared to 2,079 mboe per day for 2021. Divestments including exit from Russia and natural decline were o/ffset by the Sn\u00f8hvit, Peregrino and Njord fields resuming production and start-up of Johan Sverdrup phase 2 and Peregrino phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total renewables power generation increased by 5.6% in 2022 to 1,649 GWh, mainly due to the full year production from the Gua\u00f1izuil IIA solar plant in Argentina.\n\nThrough e/fficient and stable production Equinor delivered a unit production cost for 2022 at 6.1 USD/ boe (5.6 USD/boe real 2021). Performance came in above target, reflecting the challenging economic environment which developed since setting the target at the beginning of the year. Increasing energy cost due to the energy crisis amplified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and higher environmental costs resulted in the higher unit production cost for 2022.\n\n## Profitable portfolio\n\nEquinor's strong financial performance and results has placed the company in a robust financial position. We delivered first among peer group on Adjusted Return on Average Capital Employed for the year with a 55% adjusted ROACE*, and above average on Relative Total Shareholder Return*.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEquinor's oil and gas portfolio is well positioned to deliver energy during an ongoing energy crisis. Strong cash generation enables Equinor to continue reinvestment in an optimised oil and gas portfolio and ensuring high value growth in renewables and low carbon solutions, with USD 8.3 billion organic capex* (adjusted to USD/NOK exchange rate assumption in the Outlook presented at CMU 2022) in 2022. Equinor continue to optimise and reprioritise the non-sanctioned projects to ensure high value creation though cycles.\n\n## Significant societal value creation\n\nDelivering value to society at large and to our host communities in particular, is fundamental to the success of our ongoing business activities and the energy transition. Our 2022 performance was geared towards ensuring crucial energy production and supply, and providing significant tax contributions, employment and procurement spend. In 2022, Equinor paid over USD 45 billion in taxes and spent around USD 17.1 billion on procurement.\n\n## Integrity and anti-corruption targets met\n\nThe number of confirmed corruption cases were zero, which is aligned with the target. 95% of employees confirmed they had read, understood and signed-o/ff the company's Code of Conduct which also addressed the gap identified in 2021.\n\n## Low carbon\n\n## Satisfactory progress on climate performance\n\nEquinor's total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 11.4 million tonnes CO\u2082e in 2022, representing a decrease compared to a three-year average. The CO\u2082 intensity was 6.9 kg CO\u2082 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is less than half of the current global industry average of 16 kg CO\u2082/boe. Equinor also continued its strong methane intensity performance with 0.02% compared to the OGCI average of 0.17%. Equinor's scope 3 GHG emissions (use of sold products) were 243 million tonnes CO\u2082e which is a slight decrease compared to a three-year average. Equinor expects to maintain the same level of oil and gas production until 2030, which may result in increased emissions from use of sold products.\n\nThe company is on track towards its ambition of allocating 30% of its gross capex* to renewables and low carbon solutions by 2025, with investments increasing to 14% in 2022, compared with 11% in 2021.\n\nTo account for both emissions and energy produced, Equinor uses a net carbon intensity (NCI) methodology, which accounts for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Equinor's NCI was 66.5 g CO\u2082e/MJ which is a slight improvement from 67.1 g CO\u2082e/MJ in 2021.",

To us, this means safety for our people, the environment, and the societies in which we operate. Our values open, courageous, collaborative and caring guide us in our continuous work to safeguard people, the environment and assets. We operate in a high-risk industry with regards to both safety and security. As an international energy company, we are highly dependent on strong collaboration with our contractors, who undertake two thirds of our activity.\n\n## Material topics\n\nThe Always safe material topics have a strong link to how Equinor impacts nature and society. Our double materiality evaluation further highlights that several of our corporate risk factors (crisis management and business continuity, safety and environmental impact, and security threats) may have a material impact on Equinor.\n\n'Safe and secure operations' addresses our commitment to ensure the health, safety and security of our people, and integrity of our operations. The corporate KPIs Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) and Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) are the most important ways we measure our performance in this regard, and SIF is also part of the framework for executive remuneration.\n\n'Protecting nature' acknowledges our responsibility for nature in relation to acute spills, regular emissions and discharges, as well as our presence in or near protected areas.\n\nTackling inequality states that we must be active in handling the inequalities we meet in our business, both internally and when interacting with suppliers, business partners and society in general. Among our own employees we work systematically to strengthen diversity and inclusion and reduce our gender pay gap, including the use of quantitative scores and ambitions. Our ambition is that everyone should have equal opportunities regardless of gender, age, nationality ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion and disability. Through our work with human rights issues, we expand our ownership for safety to the societies in which we operate.",

We believe that all accidents related to people, environment and assets can be prevented. To guide us in our journey towards our vision and strategy, we have selected SIF and TRIF as our key performance indicators. SIF includes major accident hazard and other serious safety accidents and near misses. Near misses are incidents with no actual consequences but with a serious potential.\n\nOn 1 July 2022, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy decided that Equinor ASA would be subject to parts of the Norwegian Security Act and later notifications stated that Equinor would become subject to activities which are of vital importance to fundamental national functions. Equinor then began to work on responding to the requirements of the Security Act decision and achieving compliance.",

It guides the safety work and outlines prioritised activities throughout the company across four categories: safety visibility, leadership and behaviour, learning and follow up, and safety indicators.\n\nHuman and organisational performance (HOP) principles underpin the way in which we develop a proactive and visible safety culture. The HOP approach provides guidance on how people, technology, organisations and processes interact as a system, and how these conditions can influence the causes of human errors. HOP is implemented in leadership training across the company, and HOP focal points were established and trained in 2022 to support the roll-out and training.\n\nEquinor works together with suppliers and contractors to achieve a standardised and common approach to the safety improvement agenda. Formalised collaborations based on Life saving rules, Annual wheel and common KPIs have been established and committed through signed collaboration charters. Joint meetings across the established safety charters were held in 2022 and alignment on the agreed targets and priorities achieved. All these arenas are open and transparent venues for sharing of learning both ways.\n\nClose cooperation with other operators is vital for the work to succeed.

Our oil spill response capabilities are in line with\n\ngood international practice and leverage expertise and resources made available through our membership of local and international oil spill response organisations. Equinor personnel routinely participate in training and exercises on their roles and responsibilities in emergency response situations, to be su/fficiently prepared if, and when, incidents occur. Joint exercises with interaction between internal and external actors were carried out during 2022.\n\nIn response to the European security situation a strategic project team reporting to the CEO and the CEC was established from February to December to\n\nensure risks and challenges were managed holistically across the company. The purpose was to maintain safe and e/fficient operations and prepare the company for short- and long-term impact. The strategic project team facilitated close interaction and collaboration with key stakeholders, partners and Norwegian authorities and security agencies. Equinor increased the state of alert in Norway and for parts of the international business in September.

This is the lowest number of leaks ever recorded and came close to achieving our ambitious 2022 target of a maximum of seven leaks. No serious well control incident recorded.\n\nThere was an increase in Tier 1 process safety incidents that included loss of primary containment. A total of 14 incidents were classified as Tier 1 in 2022, while the total number for 2021 was 8. However, the sum of Tier 1 and the less severe Tier 2 incidents was reduced.\n\nThe positive trend on the safety-critical maintenance backlog continued during 2022. Reducing this backlog is important in preventing major accidents.\n\n## Personnel health and safety\n\nThe total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) increased to 2.5, up from 2.4 in 2021 and the 2022 target of 2.2 was not achieved.

Historically our operated onshore activities were limited to oil and gas, including drilling and fracturing of wells in the US. Recent investments in and our ambitions for CCS, solar, hydrogen and battery storage projects underline the increasing importance of our management of onshore environments.\n\nOur operations have actual or potential impacts on nature through pollution, including regular and uncontrolled discharges to sea or land and emissions to air. Our use of land and sea areas and related disturbances, including the noise of our operations and the risk of collisions with animals, and introduction of alien invasive species from maritime vessels, may also negatively impact biodiversity and ecosystems. This is of particular importance if our activities are in or near protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value. Through our partners and suppliers, we may also indirectly contribute to impacts on nature, for example\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin activities where large quantities of materials like metals, cement and chemicals are used.\n\nThere are increasing expectations from policy makers, academia, civil society, and communities among others, for urgent action to reverse biodiversity loss this decade. Global and regional biodiversity policies and risk management and disclosure frameworks are being developed and strengthened in support of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. These developments constitute a new set of detailed expectations for companies related to impacts and dependencies on nature and have direct relevance to Equinor's operations and its supply chains. Equinor aims to go beyond the zero-harm principle and take relevant actions to reduce potential adverse impacts and contribute to positive impacts.\n\nThe shift to a more resource-e/fficient, circular economy is a key area increasingly being reflected in stakeholder expectations and commercial agreements, for example in the context of the EU Taxonomy and for new wind farm developments. Another important development is the increased focus on the dependencies of nature and ecosystem services. Relevant dependencies for Equinor include the extraction of natural resources in our supply chain and the bioremediation service that healthy oceans provide when we discharge produced water containing minor fractions of oil and chemicals to sea at some of our o/ffshore platforms.\n\n## Management approach\n\nTo manage our impacts on nature, alongside complying with applicable laws and regulations, we aim to apply recognised environmental management practices. This\n\nincludes application of the precautionary approach, best available techniques, the mitigation hierarchy and the ISO 14001 environmental management principles.\n\nIn 2021, in support of the global ambition of reversing nature loss by 2030, we announced in our Biodiversity position statement ambitions of going beyond the 'do-no-harm' principle by developing a net-positive approach. In 2022, we finalised the first set of methodologies for net-positive impact plans and sitespecific inventories of key biodiversity features and started establishing such inventories. From 2023, we will develop plans aiming for a net-positive impact for all new development projects in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value. The methodologies were developed through pilots in investment projects (including collaboration with bp at our joint o/ffshore wind developments o/ff the US East Coast), and assets in operation, and further implementation is planned. Further information can be found in our sustainability pages at equinor.com.\n\nDuring 2022, we also followed the work of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) as a member of the TNFD Forum. To prepare for implementation of emerging nature-related risk and disclosure frameworks, we initiated internal materiality assessments and assessments of relevant metrics and indicators.\n\nOur governance, risk and performance framework enables us to systematically manage environmental aspects. Our first priority is to avoid potential negative impacts. If this cannot be done, we aim to minimise them. In the planning phases of all our assets, before construction or operations can commence, a key",

        "page_content": "part of our management approach is environmental and social risk and impact assessments, including stakeholder engagement. This also includes baseline studies, surveys, monitoring programmes, and collaborative research projects to build knowledge and develop tools. Our oil spill response capabilities are described in section 2.1.1 Safe and secure operations. We publish documentation from project-specific impact assessments on our own website and make biodiversity-related data available through solutions owned by others, such as the Norwegian and UK authorities.\n\nIn 2022, we enhanced our focus on environmental regulatory compliance including specific improvement initiatives for our oil and gas assets in Norway. This included improved governance and collaboration, training and awareness initiatives, increased follow-up, and operational measures.\n\nSubstitution of chemicals for less environmentally harmful ones is part of our continual improvement e/fforts. For example, in 2022, we completed a campaign to substitute firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with fluorine-free foams across our Norwegian operations.\n\nWe are also piloting an approach for sharing more biodiversity-related data via data.equinor.com. Equinor is a member of the Ocean Decade Corporate Data Group co-hosted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and Fugro. The aim of this initiative is to make privately held ocean data available for scientific research and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ndecision making to address the challenges identified through the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.\n\nGrowth in renewables is core to our Energy transition plan, and we need to understand how best to achieve this ambition in a nature-positive way. For example, we actively use Hywind Scotland, the world's first floating wind farm, as a test site to increase our knowledge of potential environmental impacts of such assets, and we aim to continue this work with the new Hywind Tampen wind farm on the NCS. Research topics include sound emissions from wind turbines, and we use remote sensing technology to assess potential reef-e/ffects. We also undertake research on potential impacts on birds and how to mitigate them.\n\nCollaboration with external stakeholders is fundamental to our approach, which helps us to build our knowledge and develop innovative solutions to address biodiversity. In 2022, we extended our participation in a range of research programmes and industry partnerships, such as the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre's (UNEPWCMC) Proteus Partnership. We also joined a project led by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which aims to identify good practices for renewable energy development.\n\nWe are also working to improve our understanding of circular economy opportunities. This includes our approach to waste management in general, as well as to specific recycling opportunities such as wind turbine blades and materials from the decommissioning and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nremoval of o/ffshore facilities. Through the supply chains for our oil and gas, and renewables activities, we purchase large quantities of steel, other metals, cement, and various materials used in drilling and completion of wells. Each of the respective supply chains may impact nature in various ways and have specific waste management needs and practices. We apply the\n\nwaste hierarchy to primarily avoid waste generation and follow key circular economy principles such as the re-use, recycling and recovery of materials. The largest waste volumes from our own operations are oily wastewater from oil and gas processing and oiled drill cuttings.",

A complete set of performance data can be found in our Sustainability datahub at equinor.com.\n\nThere were no serious accidental spills in 2022, and the total volume of accidental oil spills and other spills was considerably reduced from 2021 to 2022. However, the total number of spills increased slightly. A discharge of 581,000 m\u00b3 of treated process water from the Mongstad refinery water treatment plant was reported as a breach of permit. This was because the discharge occurred closer to shore than permitted and the volume was larger and the period longer than initially communicated to the Norwegian Environment Agency.\n\nOver the past four-to-five years, non-GHG emissions to air and regular, permitted discharges of oil in water to sea have trended downwards slightly, or remained at the same level. The increase in SOx emissions from 2021 to 2022 was due mainly to the restart of production at the Peregrino FPSO in July 2022. However, SOx emissions from the asset are lower than in earlier years due to an ongoing fuel switch from diesel to imported natural gas. Hazardous waste quantities increased from 2021, mainly caused by increased volumes of water dispatched from Mongstad for further treatment. This water stems from well cleaning at o/ffshore platforms. Increased quantities of drill cuttings due to increased drilling activity in Norway also contributed to an increase in hazardous waste quantities. Exempt waste quantities are at a low level since only three wells were drilled and fractured during 2022, all of which are at a single location in the US.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n| Indicators                                                                              | Units      |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |   2018 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| SOx emissions                                                                           | ktonnes    |    1.1 | 0.9    | 1.3    | 2.2    |    1.8 |\n| NOx emissions                                                                           | ktonnes    |   32   | 34     | 36     | 41     |   42   |\n| Non-methane volatile organic compounds                                                  | ktonnes    |   23   | 26     | 35     | 40     |   46   |\n| Accidental oil spills (net volume >0)                                                   | Number     |  111   | 120    | 136    | 219    |  239   |\n|                                                                                         | m\u00b3         |   33   | 40     | 154    | 8,913  |  138   |\n| Other accidental spills (net volume >0)                                                 | Number     |  122   | 98     | 117    | 204    |  199   |\n|                                                                                         | m\u00b3         |  302   | 3,335  | 3,997  | 57     |  934   |\n| Serious accidental spills                                                               | Number     |    0   | 0      | 2      | 3      |    1   |\n| Regular discharges of oil in water to sea                                               | ktonnes    |    1.1 | 1.1    | 1.3    | 1.2    |    1.1 |\n| Hazardous waste generated                                                               | ktonnes    |  304   | 280    | 318    | 313    |  244   |\n| Non-hazardous waste generated                                                           | ktonnes    |   37   | 33     | 29     | 40     |   31   |\n| Exempt waste generated - drill cuttings and solids from   US onshore operations         | ktonnes    |    1.2 | 0      | 17     | 84     |   55   |\n| Exempt waste generated - produced water and flowback   water from US onshore operations | million m\u00b3 |    0.1 | 2      | 5      | 7      |    6   |\n\n## Biodiversity and nature\n\nIn 2022, we expanded the scope of reporting in relation to where we have operations in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value. We now include linear infrastructure (e.g., pipelines and cables) for which Equinor is technical service provider on behalf of other operators, resulting in inclusion of the Europipe I and II pipelines which both crosses the Wadden Sea UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS). The Wadden Sea was included in the WHS list in 2009, while the pipeline installations were completed in 1995 and 1999, respectively. We otherwise did not operate within other sites on the WHS list or sites in the International Union",

This is partially caused by the increase in renewables activity and the increased disclosure scope (as explained above). A summary of our presence in relation to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value is shown below and a complete overview is available in the ESG reporting centre on equinor.com.\n\nNPI plans are being developed for several assets, for which the Empire Wind project in the US and the Rosebank project in the UK are first in scope.\n\nWithdrawal and consumption of freshwater in 2022 was 6 million m\u00b3, a reduction from 8 million m\u00b3 in 2021. We had no oil, gas or renewable energy production in, nor did we withdraw water from areas of high or extremely high baseline water stress as defined by the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct\u00ae tool.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n## Non-GHG emissions, discharges and waste\n\nFor 2022, non-GHG emissions to air and the volume of discharges and spills to sea were mainly at the same level or trending downwards. We have also taken measures to reduce SOx emissions at the Peregrino FPSO. We therefore believe our approach to non-GHG emissions is e/ffective and is producing the intended results.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n|                                                                                               | Assets\u00b9   | Licenses\u00b2   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| In the vicinity (5 - 20 km) 3 - of protected areas  - of areas high biodiversity value        | 18        | 1           |\n|                                                                                               | 17        | 1           |\n| Close (1 - 5 km) 3 - to protected areas                                                       | 10        | 0           |\n| - to areas of high biodiversity value   - protected areas  - areas of high biodiversity value | 2 7       | 0 0  0      |\n| Adjacent (< 1 km) 3 - to protected areas  - to areas of high biodiversity value   Inside 3    | 20  15 32 | 0 0         |\n\n- 1. 'Assets' means o/ffshore platforms including subsea tie-ins, onshore plants, pipelines and other linear infrastructure in operation or under construction.\n- 2.  'Licences' includes only those licences where there have been operational activities other than 1) above, e.g., seismic acquisition, exploration drilling, site surveys.\n- 3.  If several protected areas (PA) or areas of high biodiversity value (AHBV) are present within a proximity category around a given asset or operation, they are counted as one. If a given PA or AHBV are within proximity categories for several assets or operations, it is counted in for each of these assets or operations. Subsea installations within a field are included in the counting of the platform it is tied in to. For existing linear infrastructure like pipelines, service lines and cables, only the 'Inside' and 'Adjacent' categories are applied. In cases where linear infrastructure is installed during a given reporting year, all proximity categories are applied. Information on geographic location of cases represented in the table above can be found in the 'Sustainability performance data hub' on Equinor.com.\n\nGenerated waste volumes, which stay at the same levels as previous years, are mainly dependent on activity levels within drilling, well clean-up and maintenance. We also initiated an improvement initiative to establish a circular economy framework aiming for better management of use, reuse and recycling of resources, including waste.\n\nAlthough the accidental spill volumes are lower in 2022 compared to the previous year, we are not satisfied with the fact that the number of such spills increased slightly since 2021. As also raised by the Norwegian Environmental Agency, we continue to have compliance issues related to the number of accidental spills and breaches of discharge permits for our operations in Norway. The improvement activity addressing governance, competence, awareness and performance in this area, continues.\n\n## Biodiversity and nature\n\nOur approach and ongoing improvement activities related to our impacts on biodiversity are viewed as representing an adequate response to the global expectations and need for action against loss of biodiversity. The increase in numbers showing our presence in or adjacent to protected areas, is the outcome of increased disclosure scope (as explained above) and our expanding renewables portfolio. We continued our implementation of a net positive approach as outlined in our biodiversity position, including relevant disclosure metrics and preparation of NPI plans. The reduced level of withdrawal and consumption of freshwater is considered a positive development.",

The Russia-Ukraine war and its ripple e/ffects on access to food and energy, alongside the cost of living crisis, can have significant implications for individuals who already face challenges to their basic human rights. Understanding and managing the risk of adverse human rights impacts related to our activities is at the core of our human rights commitment. This is consistent with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the ten principles of the Global Compact and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. We recognise that our activities can cause, contribute, or be linked to negative\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nhuman rights and other social impacts, especially in jurisdictions with weak regulatory frameworks or enforcement, and where our activities face inherent risks. Addressing gaps towards international labour standards continues to be our main salient issue. Specifically, addressing the possibility of forced labour connected to our supply chains, a situation exacerbated by global instability, increased inequality and continued e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic, remains our key concern.\n\n## Management approach\n\nEquinor's human rights policy applies to all our activities. In accordance with the company's risk management system, we identify adverse human rights risks and impacts, and work to prevent, mitigate or remediate as\n\nrelevant to each situation. During 2022, we continued our e/fforts to further integrate human rights practices into the way we work, supported by regular senior leadership engagement.\n\nFocus on labour rights and living wages is identified as one of the core priorities of the Just Transition plan which embeds respect for human rights as fundamental to achieving a just and fair transition.\n\nThe executive-level human rights steering committee continues to serve as an advisory group focusing on learning and experience transfer, actions to address Equinor's key human rights risks, and supporting the engagement with and reporting to the CEC and BoD. Areas of discussion have included risk mitigation in project development, enterprise risk level and mitigation, and new disclosure initiatives to drive transparency.\n\nWithin Equinor, it is the responsibility of the riskowner to conclude where human rights due diligence e/fforts should be prioritised. Defining such priorities is based on regular risk and portfolio assessments and supported by a corporate team of human rights experts who help ensure alignment across the portfolio. In 2022, we continued to look for indications of forced labour and unacceptable working conditions in our supply chains, particularly within fabrication and construction activities across Asia and in core countries such as Brazil. Compared to previous years, risk assessments in the earlier phases of project planning\n\nwere prioritised, to better inform decision making and allow for more e/ffective mitigation. To understand risks related to our activities, we perform environmental and social impact assessments. These are an essential part of our project development process and allow for proactive consultation with stakeholders to inform our understanding of community impacts. This includes addressing potential impacts on indigenous peoples, which continue to be a priority. For certain high-risk activities, we may perform additional and specific human rights risk assessments, typically supported by external experts. During project execution, by engaging with potentially a/ffected stakeholders through worker dialogue, we get better understanding of any potential issues and are able to respond with appropriate means of remediation where necessary. We follow up with suppliers based on identified risk, including verifications, tracking of actions and ongoing dialogue. We expect all current and future suppliers to be familiar with and apply our general human rights expectations. We include specific human rights clauses in all our contracts, based on scope and location of delivery, which typically define the risk level.\n\nAs we enter 2023, a further strengthening of our management system is underway, including global working requirements for human rights due diligence and new requirements for internal reporting. We continue to build our expert-level corporate capabilities, both through the recruitment of specialists and by improving work processes to better leverage internal capacity and know how.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The introduction of a standalone Human rights statement is a direct response to the Norwegian Transparency and Human Rights Due Diligence Act and is an opportunity to broaden our external disclosure and communication on our human rights approach, risks and work. To ensure compliance with the Act, Equinor has created an internal procedure for capturing and processing information requests.\n\n## Performance disclosure\n\n## Labour rights and decent work\n\nWe require all new suppliers to be screened for social criteria. In line with our approach to performing risk assessments in the early phases of our projects, we assessed 283 suppliers for social impacts in 2022. From this, 154 suppliers were identified as having significant gaps. 84% of these suppliers have through closing of gaps become qualified, while the rest of the suppliers are yet to complete their improvement plans. If we find that a supplier will not implement necessary improvements, the supplier will not be awarded a contract. There were no circumstances where suppliers were not willing to improve to become qualified, and no circumstances where findings or lack of collaborative actions resulted in a need to terminate a relationship.\n\nAligned to our corporate priorities, we assessed conditions for workers involved in specific construction projects in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nChina. Indicators of forced labour as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) were identified in one contract we are linked to, mainly related to payment of recruitment fees, retention of identity documents, and restriction of movement. This means that during 2022, we identified 61 individuals as subject to at the minimum one indicator of forced labour within our supply chains. We continued to work with our partners to provide remedy in these instances, including compensation towards undue payments. In 2022 payments were made to 1,791 previously identified workers, to the value of over USD 2 million.\n\nThe number of supplier assessments varies with nature and level of activity and is not necessarily comparable\n\nyear-on-year. However, our approach to be more targeted towards high-risk sites and suppliers and focus on site visits and worker interviews as opposed to more traditional audits, has resulted in a gradual decrease. We do not find it relevant to set targets towards number of assessments.\n\nDue to publicly reported concerns of serious labour exploitation in solar supply chains, we continued our task force focusing on actions to mitigate short-term and longer-term risks. Actions include increasing and requesting traceability throughout the supply chain, seeking contractual safeguards, engaging with industry initiatives, and investigating opportunities for alternative sourcing routes.\n\n## Labour rights and working conditions in the supply chain\n\n| Indicators                                                        | Boundary                            | Unit             |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Supplier human rights (HR) verifications  conducted               | Equinor group                       | number           |     24 |     30 |     37 |     50 | 75     |\n| Workers interviewed                                               | Equinor group                       | number           |    808 |    974 |    343 |    650 | 1,000  |\n| Countries in which supplier HR verifications  undertaken          | Equinor group                       | number           |     11 |     10 |      9 |     16 | 20     |\n| Employees working with our suppliers  trained (class room course) | Equinor group,  operational control | number  per year |    264 |    128 |    190 |    409 | 514    |\n\n/ffflfi201345\n\n/ffflfi2013456\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Management system\n- Ensuring fair treatment and non-discrimination\n- Providing safe, healthy and secure workplace and accomodation\n- Providing fair wages and reasonable working hours\n- Respecting freedom of assembly, association and the right to collective bargaining\n- Preventing modern slavery\n- Preventing child labour and protecting young workers\n- Providing access to remedy\n- Subcontracting",

        "page_content": "## A step-up in shipping and oil and gas storage\n\nDuring 2022 a special task force, consisting of business line representatives and human rights expertise developed specific requirements and tools to embed human rights due diligence in our shipping and oil and gas storage business. Alongside these e/fforts, tailormade full-day classroom training was delivered to approximately 70 business professionals.\n\nHuman rights were also a core topic at our regular Working safely with suppliers conference. Bringing shipping and storage suppliers together in Stavanger, this event includes leadership expectations, panel conversations, and roundtable discussions to explore common challenges and ways forward.\n\nSupplier dialogue and onsite human rights assessments were performed at two yards where new-build vessels are being constructed.\n\n## Community risks and impacts\n\nNo potential or actual adverse impacts of indigenous peoples' rights were identified during 2022. Across our operated assets, Equinor received no eligible grievances according to our internal procedures. Issues raised which are deemed ineligible include, for example, requests for donations, sponsorships, jobs, and requests for information about collaborating or partnering with Equinor in various projects.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nTogether with Shell, we continued to actively manage the remaining human rights risks and impacts associated with the resettlement of 29 households and the discontinuation of farming and fishing a/ffecting 446 households in the area identified for a potential LNG site in Lindi, Tanzania. Specifically, the focus has been on ensuring the longer-term sustainability for impacted households. Actions include the signature of a Land agreement and the development of an agricultural livelihood baseline assessment, as the preparatory stage for an agricultural livelihood restoration programme to be implemented in 2023.\n\nThrough our joint activities to develop a solar park with Scatec in Northern Brazil, we resettled two families who were previously living and working in a location with no rights to the land or formal work contracts. Through strong Equinor-led stakeholder engagement and compliance with International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards and our human rights policy, both families have taken legal ownership of their new property, including land allocation for one family who wanted to continue farming.\n\n## Governance and capacity building\n\nIn addition to the human rights steering committee, executive leadership engagement in 2022 included participation in several external, cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder coalitions including a Commissioner role in the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality and board member at the WBCSD Energy Pathway Board, with focus on human rights and the just transition.\n\nThere was continued engagement with industry leaders, academia and subject matter experts to share experiences and to align on good practice. Internally, general and specific capability building e/fforts continued through 2022, focused around new and emerging regulations, and in particular the Norwegian Transparency Act.\n\nWe continued to deliver a third-party-facilitated Human Rights In Practice course for supply chain professionals and company representatives, focused on labour rights, Ethics, Anti-Corruption and Human Rights.\n\n## Information requests according to the Transparency Act\n\nIn 2022, Equinor received three information requests, which were all responded to within the legislative deadline. In addition, twelve questions and requests for action or information were received but not deemed legitimate under the scope of the Transparency Act. These were treated separately on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFinally, we continued the active participation in mediations related to a tragic crane accident at a South Korean yard in 2017. The process is facilitated by the Norwegian OECD National Contact Point, following the filing of a complaint alleging breaches by several companies, including Equinor, of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nWe continue, as do many, to be challenged to find meaningful and objective assessments of performance within the field of business and human rights. In 2022, as a first step towards maturing a broader performance framework, we piloted a set of internal monitoring indicators relevant to our key risks. We will continue to build on the learnings from this pilot with the aim of reporting in a more quantitative fashion in future years.\n\nAs we continue our risk-based approach to human rights due diligence within our global supply chains, we see significant risks of adverse human rights impacts, particularly related to decent work and the possibility of forced labour.\n\nWhilst it is never satisfactory to identify substandard labour conditions, we see that our e/fforts to understand potential impacts earlier in the project and procurement process as a further step towards more risk avoidance and e/ffective mitigation.\n\nOur e/fforts in 2022 focused on furthering specific actions towards the construction sector, including building leverage with peers and partners, and particular e/fforts were made towards our midstream business including shipping and oil and gas storage. A further strengthening of our internal work processes will drive more systematic and documented due diligence across the portfolio.",

Overall we believe our performance in 2022 has been satisfactory, and we have focused our work on updating the D&I strategy, ambition and metrics that will enable us to strengthen our performance in the future. The aim is to operationalise D&I further into our business and embed in how we develop our people and engage with the societies in which we operate.\n\nRecent years have seen a shift in the expectations from governments, governing bodies, society and employees when it comes to companies' social responsibility and role in D&I. To us D&I aligns with our values, our focus on safety and our purpose as a company. As outlined in our Code of Conduct, we do not tolerate any discrimination or harassment of colleagues, or others a/ffected by our operations, and require everyone to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity. Our agreement\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(likestillingsavtale) between the company and union Industri Energi applies to all employees in Equinor ASA and states that we, as an employer, work to ensure all employees are treated equally regarding recruitment, pay and working conditions, training, career paths, and professional development. Equinor is committed to being transparent about our progress and we participate in several external indexes and networks. These include the SHE Index and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, where we have committed to integrate D&I into our business strategy and share experience and learning.\n\nOur updated D&I ambition states 'We are a diverse and inclusive organisation where everyone feels valued and that they belong. Our D&I strategy continues to build on strengthening a safe and inclusive work environment for all and ensuring fair and equal opportunities. The strategy strengthens Equinor's social responsibility to ensure a just energy transition and builds upon the commitments we have made as part of our new value chains.\n\n## Management approach\n\nOur D&I strategy is based on empowering the organisation to drive D&I locally, in line with national reporting requirements and local legislative frameworks. The strategy was developed through extensive external and internal stakeholder engagement and the feedback was focused on the need for local actions, diversity representation in senior leadership, and openness to talk about diversity dimensions beyond gender. The BoD was continually kept informed about progress through formal reporting channels and meetings. Throughout 2022 the CEC members were involved in shaping the strategy, and employees, union representatives, and members of employee resource groups (ERGs) were included in strategy development. A separate working group with Norwegian union representatives was established and met four times throughout the year to discuss D&I actions and progress. The D&I strategy is owned by the Human Resource team. Throughout 2022, Equinor also collaborated with the Norwegian Equality and AntiDiscrimination Ombud to share best practice of how to embed Norwegian legal requirements into business strategy.\n\nAt Equinor, we continually work to strengthen understanding of diversity, and we use the diversity data that is available to measure our progress. This includes gender balance, age, and nationality. We know that inclusion is the foundation to ensure a psychologically safe work environment where everyone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfeels valued, respected, and that they can contribute and speak up. To monitor our progress on inclusion, we established the Inclusion Index in 2019 and work systematically with initiatives that focus on our culture and inclusion. In addition to strategy development, our key D&I actions for 2022 focused on building inclusion and equity for all our employees.\n\nERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that come together with the aim to create a diverse and inclusive workplace, with a particular focus on a common diversity characteristic, cause, or goal. The establishment and support for ERGs is important for Equinor to learn about opportunities and challenges linked to equality and equity, and ensure we set actions that remove barriers for individuals who identify as part of underrepresented groups. In 2022, we focused on senior sponsorship of our ERGs and formalised D&I awareness days. A governance structure for ERGs was developed and will be implemented in 2023.\n\nWe continuously work on risks related to discrimination and harassment. In 2022, we identified a small increase in the number of sexual harassment cases. This increase was taken very seriously, and significant actions and initiatives were put in place. This included awareness sessions for leaders, safety moments for general use, and as a topic in the quarterly Safety Wheel. The annual global people survey (GPS) results were further analysed to determine targeted actions. The actions focused on increasing awareness of what constitutes sexual harassment, and ensuring people",

        "page_content": "feel safe to speak up and report inappropriate actions and behaviour. In 2023, we intend to continue using metrics to identify signals that may imply discrimination and harassment. One such metric includes the question about 'Zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment' in the GPS which we continually monitor.\n\nWe focus on strengthening inclusion of employees who identify as LGBTQ+ and increasing allyship. In 2022, we o/ffered inclusive language training (Rosa kompetanse) through the Norwegian Organisation for Sexual and Gender Diversity (FRI) to our HR, communication and recruitment department, and we are finding ways to provide this training to other groups of employees in 2023. Our focus on safety and inclusion for all LGBTQ+ colleagues was strengthened in line with local Pride events. Senior leadership communication, safetyfocused deliverables, and employee engagement were ongoing throughout the year. The Pride Makers ERG increased its activity both internally and externally and gained more members.\n\nAs part of our renewables value chain, Equinor made commitments related to D&I which include a focus on ethnicity. This work will continue in 2023. Our ERG, Black in Equinor further grew its membership and activity that increased engagement and knowledge about ethnicity and discrimination, with the aim of strengthening inclusion. Looking to 2023 and beyond, we have identified the need to include further work on diversity dimensions as part of our D&I roadmap, such as inclusion of people with disabilities, religion, caring responsibilities, and pregnancy/parental leave. Our updated D&I strategy will help us work more systematically on inclusion across all diversity dimensions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building a diverse pipeline\n\nOur focus on building a diverse employee pipeline starts with our engagement with students and young people in the locations where we operate. Through our sponsorship programmes, partnerships, and networks we aim to help shape and build a more diverse talent pool for the future. This work is also aligned with our responsibility to ensure a just energy transition. Our focus is on engaging youth and students through\n\nprogrammes and events that relate to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. This includes initiatives that target girls and women.\n\nBuilding a robust, sustainable, and diverse pipeline is important to us at Equinor. D&I is integrated in our people processes, from how we recruit, manage talent and succession, to leadership assessment and\n\ndeployment. D&I is embedded in how we work with our people, and part of our Annual Wheel for talent and succession reviews. Diversity representation and balance is discussed when building teams, identifying talent, and building succession pipelines. Diversity is also considered when we run our leadership assessments and when selecting employees for our leadership development courses.\n\nIn 2022, we hired almost 2,000 new employees and, together with our recruitment partner, we selected a diverse pool of candidates, with particular focus on gender and nationality. We provided hiring managers with recruitment training with the aim to ensure fair and unbiased assessment of all applicants. We work systematically to be an attractive employer and, in 2022 Equinor was ranked the most attractive employer for engineering students in Norway, with an increase in score from female students. We have a 50:50 global ambition for gender and nationality (Norwegian and other than Norwegian) for our corporate graduate programme, and an ambition of a one-third female share for our apprenticeship programme in Norway. A new Human Resource IT system will be implemented throughout 2023-2024 which will give us the opportunity to further improve our recruitment processes and limit biases. We are further re-evaluating our recruitment strategy for the future, and work will commence in 2023.",

Since the establishment of the inclusion index in 2019, Equinor has used this data to determine actions and opportunities to strengthen our culture. In 2022, the inclusion index level remained at 77. Systematic follow up of these results will take place early 2023 to determine actions that aim to strengthen inclusion.\n\n## 2.  Diversity in leadership\n\nEquinor works systematically to build a sustainable, robust, and diverse leadership pipeline that feeds through to diverse leadership  teams. Our focus has been on monitoring gender balance and nationality, while continually working to set up teams that, together, represent diversity beyond these two dimensions. Our systematic focus on developing female leaders is reflected in the continued increase in female leadership over the years, with 51% females among leaders reporting to the Corporate Executive Committee in 2022. We continue to focus on representation of nationalities other than Norwegian in our leadership to ensure we represent our global operations. To strengthen our longterm systematic focus on diversity in leadership, a new D&I KPI will be introduced in 2023, measuring gender balance and nationality representation in top leadership levels. The KPI will set the expectation for leaders across Equinor to focus on diversity in their talent and succession planning. We further continue to work systematically with gender balance across our organization and have\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nidentified the need to set targets and ambitions for gender balance more locally in our organisation. This approach is part of operationalising our D&I strategy in 2023.\n\n## 3.   Diversity in talent programs\n\nEquinor continues to invest in our emerging talents through our graduate and apprenticeship programmes. We focus on diversity in our early talent programs and have set targets in terms of gender and nationality. In 2022, we welcomed 130 graduates, representing 32 nationalities. In Norway we welcomed 169 apprentices. This year we saw an increase in female apprentices with 36%, exceeding our gender target of 30% female. We plan to strengthen our gender target for next year to ensure we continue this trend in the future. We also o/ffered a summer internship programme to 172 students, representing 20 nationalities\n\n## 4.   Gender pay gap\n\nEquinor publishes the earnings ratio between males and females for both total compensation and base pay. Norwegian authorities require reporting on full breakdown of earning ratios in all major Equinor locations by Equinor's job structure every other year. Equinor will report on this data annually to strengthen transparency on our gender pay gap. For 2022, we are pleased to see that the gender pay gap for base pay is 0 for Equinor ASA. This reflects the ongoing work to ensure gender-neutral pay decisions. In Equinor ASA, we continue to see a di/fference in total compensation. Our analysis shows that a key driver for this di/fferential is the higher\n\nrepresentation of males in skilled o/ffshore and other operational positions. These roles are typically compensated with a range of additional elements beyond base salary, such as o/ffshore allowances or shift allowances, as well as overtime payments. Such allowances are directly linked to the specific job an individual performs, regardless of gender. The gender imbalance in these roles compared to nonoperational onshore roles results in a wider pay gap for total compensation than with base salary. We have identified the need to do further analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the pay gap in our global locations where there is a larger gap compared to Equinor ASA. Further details on our gender pay gap reporting is available in the Equinor data hub.\n\nEquinor has worked systematically with D&I since 2019. Overall, we believe our performance in 2022 has been satisfactory, with a focus on updating the D&I strategy, ambition and metrics relevant to further integration of D&I in our business and strengthening our future performance.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 High value\n\n## Group analysis\n\n2022 witnessed an unprecedented energy crisis in Europe which was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing further disruption to the energy markets. Tight energy markets, coupled with increased demand, have led to a prolonged period of extremely high commodity prices, in particular gas which peaked at around 90 USD/MMBtu in August 2022.\n\nIn response to the conflict initiated in February 2022, Equinor took decisive action to withdraw from the Russian market and exit all assets in the country. This resulted in an impairment recognised in relation to the Russian assets of USD 1,083 million. All exit activities were concluded within the year, and Equinor has not planned for any new investments in the country as part of its future strategy.\n\nDuring the year, Equinor achieved some notable operational milestones, including the restart of Sn\u00f8hvit and Peregrino in mid-year and Peregrino phase 2 coming on stream in the fourth quarter. All provided strong contributions towards o/ffsetting the of loss of production from the Russia exit.\n\nIn response to the energy crisis in Europe, gas production was accelerated on some NCS assets due to a change from gas injection to gas export. This significantly impacted the gas production for the year from E&P Norway, increasing by 8%, and also\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ncontributed to a global 2% increase in gas production for 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nDespite the increase in gas production, restart activity and new assets coming on stream, total liquids and gas production reduced versus 2021. Equinor's exit from Russia as announced early in 2022 and turnaround activity in the US during the year, coupled with the prior year's divestment of Bakken, resulted in reduced production levels for the full year 2022 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Results\n\nSignificantly elevated realised prices and optimised product split have balanced the reduced production levels and are responsible for the significant increase in net operating income for the full year 2022 relative to 2021.\n\nStrong results were recorded from European gas and power sales optimisation and trading, as well as high refining margins and high clean spark spread positively contributing to the overall business results in 2022 relative to the same periods in the prior year.\n\nWhile price realisation has driven an increase in margins, Equinor has also witnessed inflationary pressures increasing its operating expenses. Costs pertaining to electricity, well maintenance and environmental taxes were the main contributors to this increase.

        "page_content": "is partially masked by the strengthening of the USD against the NOK.\n\nDuring 2022 depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses reduced by USD 5,328 million to USD 6,391 million. This movement included a USD 3,339 million net impairment reversal recognised in the year which was mainly due to updated estimates of value in use of property, plant and equipment impacted by internal forecast on cost, production profiles and commodity prices. The impairment recognised in the E&P International segment related to Equinor's decision to exit Russia was more than o/ffset by impairment reversals primarily related to E&P Norway price changes and gas export strategy, E&P USA Gulf of Mexico assets, E&P International production optimisation profile on Mariner and refinery margin assumptions in the MMP segment. For more information, see note 14 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe strengthening of the USD against the NOK significantly impacted net financial items in the year. The positive development of USD 1,873 million was mainly due to a net foreign exchange gain of USD 2,088 million in 2022, driven by the strengthening of the USD against NOK, compared to a gain of USD 47 million in 2021. In 2022 interest income and other financial items were USD 1,070 million higher than in 2021 due to an\n\nincrease in short-term interest rates. This was o/ffset by an increase in losses on financial derivative instruments of USD 1,037 million, resulting from an increase in longterm interest rates.\n\nIncome taxes increased from USD 23,007 million in 2021 to USD 49,861 million in 2022. This is equivalent to a positive tax rate of 63.4% for 2022, reduced from 72.8% in 2021.\n\nAfter a history of significant losses, Equinor are now recording profits in the US. Projected future taxable income demonstrates that it is probable that the unused tax losses carried forward could be utilised in the near future. The tax value of the unused accumulated losses has been recognised as a deferred tax asset of USD 2.7 billion, with a corresponding decrease in income taxes of USD 2.8 billion resulting in a low reported e/ffective tax rate compared to last year. For further information see note 11 Income taxes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nA high net income of USD 28,744 million was recorded for 2022 compared to USD 8,576 million for 2021 and a net loss of USD 5,496 million in 2020.\n\n## Capital distribution\n\nThe strong financial performance of 2022 allowed\n\n| Ordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Ordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Ordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Ordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Ordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   | Extraordinary dividend per share (in USD)   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Fiscal year                            | Q1                                     | Q2                                     | Q3                                     | Q4                                     | Sum                                         | Q1                                          | Q2                                          | Q3                                          | Q4                                          | Sum                                         |\n| 2020                                   | 0.09                                   | 0.09                                   | 0.11                                   | 0.12                                   | 0.41                                        | -                                           | -                                           | -                                           | -                                           | -                                           |\n| 2021                                   | 0.15                                   | 0.18                                   | 0.18                                   | 0.20                                   | 0.71                                        | -                                           | -                                           | -                                           | 0.20                                        | 0.20                                        |\n| 2022                                   | 0.20                                   | 0.20                                   | 0.20                                   | 0.30                                   | 0.90                                        | 0.20                                        | 0.50                                        | 0.70                                        | 0.60                                        | 2.00                                        |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEquinor to increase its quarterly dividend to total USD 2,814 million ordinary dividends in the year and USD 6,247 million extraordinary dividends (2021: 2,939 million annual ordinary dividend).\n\nFor the fourth quarter of the year, the BoD proposes to the annual general meeting a cash dividend of USD 0.30 per share, and an extraordinary quarterly dividend of USD 0.60 per share.

The decrease in non-current assets primarily relates to increased discount rates and strengthening of the USD versus the NOK.\n\n## Gross interest-bearing debt\n\nGross interest-bearing debt was USD 32.2 billion and USD 36.2 billion at 31 December 2022 and 2021, respectively. The USD 4.1 billion net decrease from 2021 to 2022 was due to the decline in current and non-current finance debt and lease liabilities. Current finance debt and lease liabilities decreased by USD 768 million, mainly due to a decrease in the utilisation of the US Commercial Paper programme, o/ffset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt, as four bonds will be repaid in 2023. Non-current finance debt decreased by USD 3.3 billion due to reclassification of non-current debt to current debt, currency e/ffects and one repaid bond in 2022 of USD 0.3 billion. The weighted average annual interest rate on finance debt was 3.29% and 3.33% at 31 December 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The decrease of USD 14.2 billion from 2021 to 2022 was mainly related to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of USD 1.4 billion, a USD 8.6 billion increase in current financial investments and a decrease in gross interest-bearing debt of USD 4.1 billion.\n\n## The net debt to capital employed ratio*\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio* before adjustments was -32.6% and 2.2% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted* was -23.9% and -0.8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe 34.8 percentage point decrease in net debt to capital employed ratio* before adjustments from 2021 to 2022 was mainly related to the reduction of net interest-bearing debt of USD 14.2 billion.\n\nThe 23.1 percentage points decrease in net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted* from 2021 to 2022 was related to the decline in net interest-bearing debt adjusted of USD 10.1 billion, o/ffset by an increase in capital employed adjusted* of USD 4.9 billion.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (ROACE)*\n\nThe return on average capital employed (ROACE)* was 55.2% in 2022, compared to 22.7% in 2021.

Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associates, and note 7 Total revenues and other income to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following table shows the SDFI and Equinor sales volume information on crude oil and natural gas for the periods indicated.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n|                                             | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Sales Volumes                               | 2022                             | 2021                             | 2020                             |\n| Equinor 1)                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Crude oil (mmbbls) 2)                       | 334                              | 358                              | 384                              |\n| Natural gas (bcm)                           | 58.6                             | 57.4                             | 54.8                             |\n| Combined oil and gas (mmboe)                | 702                              | 719                              | 729                              |\n| Third-party volumes 3)                      |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Crude oil (mmbbls) 2)                       | 284                              | 286                              | 318                              |\n| Natural gas (bcm)                           | 7.2                              | 7.0                              | 8.1                              |\n| Combined oil and gas (mmboe)                | 330                              | 330                              | 369                              |\n| SDFI assets owned by the Norwegian State 4) |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Crude oil (mmbbls) 2)                       | 132                              | 143                              | 132                              |\n| Natural gas (bcm)                           | 42.9                             | 41.7                             | 38.4                             |\n| Combined oil and gas (mmboe)                | 402                              | 406                              | 374                              |\n| Total                                       |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Crude oil (mmbbls) 2)                       | 750                              | 787                              | 835                              |\n| Natural gas (bcm)                           | 108.7                            | 106.2                            | 101.3                            |\n| Combined oil and gas (mmboe)                | 1,434                            | 1,455                            | 1,472                            |\n\n- 1) The Equinor volumes included in the table above are based on the assumption that volumes sold were equal to lifted volumes in the relevant year. Volumes lifted by E&P International or E&P USA but not sold by MMP, and volumes lifted by E&P Norway, E&P International or E&P USA and still in inventory or in transit may cause these volumes to di/ffer from the sales volumes reported elsewhere in this report by MMP.\n- 2)  Sales volumes of crude oil include NGL and condensate. All sales volumes reported in the table above include internal deliveries to our manufacturing facilities.\n- 3)  Third-party volumes of crude oil include both volumes purchased from partners in our upstream operations and other cargos purchased in the market. The third-party volumes are purchased either for sale to third parties or for our own use. Third party volumes of natural gas include thirdparty LNG volumes\n- 4)  The line item SDFI assets owned by the Norwegian State includes sales of both equity production and third-party.",

This includes creating value for our customers, shareholders and broader society. Value can be measured by 'how' we perform and operate in addition to 'what' we produce and achieve.\n\nIn this chapter, the strategic pillar of High value is covered by the material topics; E/fficient and predictable operations, Profitable portfolio, Value creation for society, and Integrity and Anti-corruption. The indicators in the table below are key in monitoring Equinor's value performance.\n\n## E/fficient and predictable operations\n\nThe core of our business is energy provision to our customers. Optimal operational performance to drive production and how we get the energy to our customers ultimately drives the business and serves the most people. E/fficient and predictable operations are of particular importance in the current economic crisis and tight energy supply with high demand. Equity production reflects our ability to produce at a high level over time and through di/fferent phases of activity. Production cost equity volumes indicate how cost e/fficient our production operations are, thereby assessing the value of our volumes.\n\n## Profitable portfolio\n\nTo ensure the business is future-proof, robust and attractive to our shareholders now and through the energy transition, our portfolio and the development\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nof that portfolio needs to be carefully managed and evaluated to ensure profitability now and for the future. Organic capex* tracks our investment into our portfolio, which is carefully spent using targeted investment criteria. Return on average capital employed* and relative shareholder return are important ways to track value generated from the portfolio and our ability to competitively distribute that to our shareholders.\n\n## Value creation for society\n\nEquinor can influence socioeconomic development by creating job opportunities, local spending, and taxes. Return of value to the wider community can be assessed through taxes paid, of which Equinor contributes significantly due to high earnings on the NCS and a share of procurement spent locally.\n\n## Integrity and anti-corruption\n\nIntegrity and anti-corruption signify the importance Equinor places on 'how' we deliver in a high-value manner. Ethical business practices across the company's global reach are of paramount importance, measured through confirmed corruption cases. For Equinor to speak with one voice in all we do, we need to ensure alignment on our values, which is monitored through a code of conduct sign-o/ff.\n\nThe Equinor strategy assumes a sustainable high value strategic pillar achieved through the strategic priorities focusing on optimising oil and gas initiatives while focusing on high value growth in renewables and new market opportunities in LCS.\n\n## HIGH VALUE\n\n| KPI/MONITORING   INDICATOR                                    | 2022 AMBITION  (TARGET YEAR)              | STATUS                               | PERFORMANCE         2022

We focus on developing prospects with a low carbon intensity near existing fields and infrastructure to optimise value creation and prolong field lifetime. Always with safety and security as the highest priority, we deliver competitive projects and world-class drilling performance. Through our technology experience, we create significant value in project development. Our technology development and implementation will be important for operational cost-e/fficiency and decarbonisation going forward.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nIn response to the energy crisis, Equinor liaised with partners and Norwegian authorities to increase gas exports to Europe through adjusted production permits and reduced gas injection. Underpinned by safe and dependable operations, the e/fforts made it possible to increase the natural gas output from the NCS significantly during 2022.\n\nEquinor executes a significant project portfolio and supports value creation through continued e/fficient and predictable operations. Solid operational performance is delivered with high gas production from the NCS supporting European energy security. Peregrino in Brazil and Hammerfest LNG are safely back in operation, and production is resumed from Njord A and B. New important projects on stream are Johan Sverdrup phase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 on the NCS and Peregrino phase 2 in Brazil. The first power from the floating o/ffshore wind farm Hywind Tampen was produced in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Management approach\n\n## Exploration\n\nContinued exploration of hydrocarbons is important for maintaining long-term energy deliveries. On the NCS, we increasingly explore mature areas where discoveries can be tied into existing infrastructure. Utilising previous investments contribute to improved value creation and lower emission. Internationally we prioritise significant wells in growth and frontier basins.\n\nEquinor was awarded 26 new licences in mature areas on the NCS in January 2022 and 26 licences in January 2023. We drill wells based on the following main criteria: High profitability, short payback time and low carbon intensity. In addition, meeting a rising gas demand from Europe, including as input to sectors such as blue hydrogen production, will require exploration for new gas volumes.\n\nSeveral developments tied back to existing infrastructure were brought on stream over the last years, such as the Sn\u00f8hvit satellite Askeladd in 2022 and Troll phase 3 in 2021. Subsea tieback developments Kristin South, Halten East, Irpa and Verdande are underway to add value and extend the field lifetime.\n\n## Project development\n\nEquinor is responsible for a portfolio of 28 projects in execution, encompassing oil and gas projects combined with electrification projects to contribute to the energy transition.\n\nWe will reinvest in our oil and gas activity in an attractive project portfolio with an average breakeven of USD 35 per barrel and a short average payback time. We also continue to invest and grow our project portfolio within renewables and low-carbon solutions. A milestone is the first power expected in 2023 for Dogger Bank, the world's largest o/ffshore wind farm.\n\nWe use standardised and digitised solutions to ensure the delivery of competitive projects with long-term value creation and maintain a rigorous quality and cost focus. With the pursuit of 'the perfect well,' a modern rig fleet and capitalising on economies of scale, we demonstrate world-class drilling performance. In external benchmarks, Equinor is ranked highly on the facility cost index for completed projects and drilling cost per metre.\n\nWe mature promising prospects towards sanction, focusing on economically viable projects with robust technical solutions and the lowest possible emissions.\n\nImprovement activities are undertaken to ensure that our project deliveries remain competitive towards a digital and carbon-neutral future.

        "page_content": "projects are developed in project development centres that strengthen the use of standardised products and tasks, enabling consistent use of best practices driving continuous learning and improvement for project development, together with good capacity utilisation. Fit-for-purpose digital solutions contributing to e/fficient and transparent decision-making and collaboration are implemented in projects with training and roll-out in the project development centres.\n\nWe work to deploy standard procurement specifications and standardised solutions in projects to reduce costs and improve e/fficiency, seeking to realise portfolio synergies and unlock value through simplification, standardisation and industrialisation. Digital well deliveries and automated well control are being implemented - new ways of working to improve safety, reduce carbon footprint and standardise the best performance. Also, we work closely with suppliers through strategic collaboration to deliver projects successfully.\n\nTechnology is an enabler in making projects cost-e/fficient and profitable. To contribute to e/fficient and reliable operations with lower CO\u2082 emissions, we aim to deploy innovative technologies in field development within both o/ffshore oil and gas, renewables and low-carbon solutions. Recent examples are Johan Sverdrup's use of 'digital twin' and the innovative Hywind technology developed by Equinor and deployed in floating wind developments, such as Hywind Scotland and Hywind Tampen, the first floating o/ffshore wind farm to supply o/ffshore oil and gas installations in operation.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Operations\n\nWe aim to ensure safe and e/fficient operations, maximising the value potential of our assets worldwide. We transform the NCS using digital and carbone/fficient solutions with electrification on installations.\n\nThe operations of our fields on the NCS are supported by three onshore integrated operations centres (IOCs), contributing to optimisation and increased production e/fficiency. Digital tools ensure faster and better decisions through close interaction between o/ffshore operations and the onshore support centre. Furthermore, the centres strengthen our collaboration with suppliers and partners, enhance the knowledge transfer across the organisation, and benefit from economies of scale. The IOCs contribute to safe and optimal operations of our installations, identifying challenges and preventing shutdowns.\n\nA separate unit within Equinor works to provide value creation for late-life fields. Innovative approaches, such as using ambulating teams has resulted in e/fficiency gains and eliminated backlog of critical maintenance.\n\nWe create value by increasing recovery and prolonging field life from our producing assets, capitalising on existing infrastructure. Projects brought on stream and tied into existing infrastructure in 2022 were the fifth Johan Sverdrup platform, the revamped Njord A and storage vessel, the third Peregrino wellhead platform and a Roncador IOR project in Brazil. The Peregrino field in Brazil and Sn\u00f8hvit in the Barents Sea were safely brought back into production, and the refurbished\n\nHammerfest LNG plant resumed operations after having been suspended following the Melk\u00f8ya fire in September 2020. Production started on the Vito deepwater platform, operated by Shell, in early 2023.\n\nWe worked with partners and government authorities throughout 2022 to increase gas exports to Europe through increased production permits, reduced gas injection, and optimisation of NGL to increase gas calorific value. The flexibility in our gas portfolio allowed us to transport and sell gas where it was most needed.\n\nLaying the ground for cost-e/fficient and sustainable operations in the future, we electrify o/ffshore and onshore installations. The electric power supply is provided either through power cables from shore, or by o/ffshore wind turbines, and is operational at several\n\nfields on the NCS. The Johan Sverdrup field, brought into production in 2019, emits only 0.67 kg CO\u2082 per barrel, compared to the global average of 15 kg per barrel, mainly owing to power supply from shore. The Hywind Tampen floating wind farm to supply Gullfaks and Snorre started production in 2022. Work is underway to electrify other NCS fields.\n\nLeveraging 25 years of operational experience and technology within carbon capture and storage (CCS) on the NCS, we work to develop solutions for CCS, expected to play a major part in the Norwegian climate solution. The Northern Lights infrastructure project for CO\u2082 transport and storage is well underway, and the development of a CO\u2082 storage at Smeaheia is under consideration.\n\n## Performance disclosure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| KPI/MONITORING                                   | 2022 AMBITION                             | STATUS   | PERFORMANCE         2022               2021   | PERFORMANCE         2022               2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| INDICATOR                                        | (TARGET YEAR)                             |          |                                               |                                               |\n| EFFICIENT AND PREDICTABLE OPERATIONS             |                                           |          |                                               |                                               |\n| Equity production liquids and gas (mboe per day) | 2022 outlook guiding \u02dc2% above  2021\u00b9 , \u00b3 |          | Growth 0%  (2039)                             | 2079                                          |\n| Production cost equity volumes (USD/boe)         | <5 USD/bbl (2021-2026)\u00b9                   | , \u00b2      | 5.6\u00b2                                          | 5.4                                           |\n\nText in bold: Key performance indicator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Ambition met in 2022\n- Ambition not met in 2022\n\nPlan in  place,  on  track  to  reach  longer-term ambition\n\n- Plan in place, not on track to reach longer-term ambition",

Divestment of assets, including exit from Russian assets, and natural decline contributed to the decrease. The Sn\u00f8hvit, Peregrino and Njord fields resumed production in 2022, and Johan Sverdrup phase 2 and Peregrino phase 2 started production in the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower liquid production was partially o/ffset by increased gas production, as Equinor implemented measures to increase deliveries of natural gas to Europe.\n\nRebased for portfolio measures the equity production was flat from 2021 to 2022. The result is below the guided outlook ambition of a 2% production increase, mainly due to later startup of new fields than assumed in the initial guiding forecast, and operations.\n\nTotal entitlement liquids and gas production was 1,901 mboe per day in 2022 compared to 1,931 mboe in 2021. The production was mainly influenced by the factors mentioned above.\n\nOver time, the volumes lifted and sold will equal the entitlement production, but they may be higher or lower\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nin any period due to di/fferences between the capacity and timing of the vessels lifting our volumes and the actual entitlement production during the period.\n\n## Unit Production Cost (UPC)\n\nThe equity Unit Production Cost (UPC) for 2022 ended on 6.1 USD/bbl (compared towards the 2021 USD real base outlook assumptions, the 2022 UPC ended at 5.6 USD/bbl). The increase in UPC from 2021 to 2022 is mainly related to increase in the energy cost and CO\u2082 cost. In addition, there has been portfolio adjustments resulting in increased equity share in Statfjord licence, being a late life field with high UPC.\n\nThe UPC ambition communicated at Capital Market Update (CMU) in February 2023 is to keep the UPC below 6,0 USD/bbl (USD 2022 real term) in the period from 2023-2026.\n\n## Renewables Power Generation\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, the total renewable power generation increased by 5.6 % (from 1,562 GWh to 1,649 GWh). The increased power production is mainly due to a full year operation of the Gua\u00f1izuil IIA solar plant in Argentina.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "unpredictability, suppliers are building increased profit risk elements into the contract quotes.\n\nIn order to maintain a profitable portfolio and reliably supply energy through the transition, Equinor is transforming its portfolio to become a broad energy company. Equinor believes that by being a leading company in the energy transition, we can not only reduce our own CO\u2082 footprint, but also maximise value for both society and our shareholders. Building a portfolio that has robust profitability through future cycles will be essential for us to deliver on our Energy Transition Plan and provide shareholder value.\n\n## Management approach\n\n## Portfolio composition\n\nOur ambition is to build a focused, carbon e/fficient oil and gas portfolio complemented with renewable and low-carbon solutions to create long-term value while supplying reliable energy with progressively lower emissions. Future oil and natural gas prices are uncertain and Equinor believes it is positioned to capture the upside and withstand the downside.\n\nAs illustrated by the following graph, the share of gross capex* in renewables and low-carbon solutions increased from 11% in 2021 to 14% in 2022. Based on current portfolio forecasts, we are progressing on our ambitions to have more than 30% of our annual gross capex* allocated to renewables and low-carbon solutions in 2025. This growth will be contingent on access and profitability.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Renewables & Low Carbon Solutions share of gross CAPEX*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to the long-term nature of investments in energy projects it is expected that our rising share of investments in renewable energy projects will have an increasing impact on the oil, gas and renewables ratios in the total production profile as the projects come into operation. In 2022 Equinor produced a total of 4.3 million TJ of energy, 16 thousand TJ of which was from renewables. By 2030, we aim to reach an installed net capacity of 12-16 GW of renewables, with the potential to produce between 35 and 60 TWh annually, while maintaining our energy production from oil and gas at around the same level as today.\n\n## Investment criteria and portfolio robustness:\n\nEquinor's strategy is to continue to create long-term, high value growth by developing a broad portfolio pipeline and applying strict robustness criteria to investments. To maintain a valuable portfolio in di/fferent\n\n## Energy production indicator\n\n(Equinor production, expressed as fossil fuel equivalents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n[1] Energy delivered to grid from gas fired power plants based on third party gas.\n\n[2] The primary energy of fossil based electricity is equal to the energy content of the combusted fuel. Actual gas consumption data is used to calculate this figure.\n\n[3] The primary energy of renewable electricity is calculated based on the equivalent amount of fossil fuel required to generate that amount of electricity in a standard thermal power plant with an e/fficiency of 36.8%. This means that renewable energy delivered to grid (expressed as TJ) is multiplied with a factor 1/0.368 = 2.7.\n\npossible energy transition pathways, Equinor has a financial framework in place addressing climate-related risks and the robustness of investment proposals.\n\n## Investment criteria\n\nWhen a project is being sanctioned, it is assessed on multiple measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Net present value (NPV): to bring value to the company and our shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Price sensitivities: to assess the impact of di/fferent prices on the investment.\n- \u00b7 Other considerations include: safety, security and sustainability, optionality, resource e/fficiency and alternative cost, strategic value, country risk, operational capacity and capability. We undertake environmental and social impact assessments for all new projects including consideration of potential human rights impacts.\n\nIn addition, for oil and gas projects, the following assessments are undertaken:\n\n- \u00b7 Break-even price: to remain robust in low-price scenarios we use a break-even target for all oil and gas projects.\n- \u00b7 CO\u2082 intensity: all oil and gas projects are measured on scope 1 CO\u2082 intensity (upstream).\n- \u00b7 Carbon pricing: a CO\u2082 cost acts as an additional element of robustness, including application of Equinor's internal carbon price.\n\nEquinor recognises that planned investments that are not sanctioned can have negative economic consequences for connected suppliers, partners, and end users of energy. We therefore work closely with all stakeholders, including local governments to explore solutions that enable Equinor to proceed with investment, or alternatively to find new developers or owners.",

        "page_content": "## Portfolio robustness\n\nEquinor maintains significant capex flexibility in our current portfolio, with only our sanctioned projects being committed, representing less than 50% of the total capex between 2024 and 2026. This will allow us to optimise and re-prioritise our non-sanctioned projects to ensure we continue to generate high value through cycles. The volume weighted break-even price of our upstream projects coming on stream in the next 10 years is around 35 USD/bbl. Operated projects already sanctioned have a weighted average breakeven price below 30 USD/bbl (calculated from date of sanction). Despite increased competition, we maintain our expectation of real base project returns of 4% to 8% for renewables excluding the e/ffects of farmdowns and project financing.\n\n## Portfolio Stress Test\n\nSince 2016 Equinor has tested the resilience of its portfolio against the scenarios from the IEAs World Energy Outlook (WEO) report. WEO scenarios change from year to year and in the 2022 WEO report they were:\n\n- \u00b7 Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS).\n- \u00b7 Announced Pledges Scenario (APS).\n- \u00b7 Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).\n\nThe WEO 2022 scenarios illustrate the wide range of possible demand for di/fferent energy sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables. The scenarios show that relative to 2021, oil and gas energy demand in 2050 could be 10% higher (STEPS) or 40% lower (APS). The NZE scenario shows a significant 70% reduction\n\nin oil and gas energy demand and relies on a rapid growth of alternative energy sources.\n\nWe test our portfolio by applying the price assumptions for oil, natural gas and CO\u2082 tax in each of these scenarios and compare the impact towards the value calculated at our commodity price assumptions 4 . Equinor's commodity price assumptions are based on management's best estimate of the development of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances. This price-set is currently not equal to a price-set in accordance with the achievements of the goals in the Paris Agreement as described in the WEO Sustainability Development Scenario, or the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.\n\n## Portfolio stress test 2022\n\nThe Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios have a median expected global temperature rise by 2050 of around 1.95\u00baC and 1.65\u00baC respectively.\n\nThe Net Zero Emissions scenario is consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00baC with a 50% probability.\n\nThe illustration shown displays the net present value after tax (NPV) in the WEO scenarios relative to value using Equinor's commodity price assumptions.\n\nCompared to last year's report, the impact from the Stated Policies Scenario has increased from 30% to 41%, and the impact from the Announced Pledges Scenario has increased from 12% to 17%. The Net Zero\n\nEmissions Scenario decreases NPV by 22%, 12% less than last year. Our long-term strategy remains firm, however the change from last year is mainly impacted by the bridging of high current commodity prices towards the initial WEO 2030 scenario price point. The resilience in our oil and gas portfolio, combined with our continuous focus on maintaining flexibility, positions us well towards di/fferent future scenarios and towards a sustained low-price environment.\n\nNPV is calculated forward looking from 2023. We assume a linear bridging between 2022 prices and the first price point given by the IEA in 2030. This bridging is consistent with methodology used in previous years. However, due to high commodity prices seen in 2022, this methodology leads to some of the IEA scenarios having higher commodity prices than Equinor's commodity price assumptions for some years towards 2030. We further assume a linear\n\n## Portfolio stress test 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ninterpolation between IEA's price from 2030 to 2050 and that the price in 2050 is kept constant in real terms thereafter. USD 2 per boe transportation cost for oil production is added to compare with Brent Blend. Exploration activities are not included due to the uncertainties related to potential discoveries and development solutions. The WEO scenarios renders some volumes unprofitable, which could have implications for sanctioning of new projects. Equinor's renewable projects are not fully influenced by the price assumptions in the di/fferent scenarios, due to o/fftake agreements. Furthermore, the scenarios primarily stress oil and gas prices, not reflecting the potential impact on our renewable and low carbon projects in an accelerated transition scenario. Our portfolio flexibility may help us to reduce the negative impact seen in the low-price scenarios by mitigating actions such as reoptimizing the non-sanctioned portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Carbon pricing and carbon costs\n\nFor portfolio and decision analysis, our base assumptions include a carbon cost for all assets and projects. In countries where no such cost exists, we use a generic cost starting from 2023. We use a default minimum at 68 USD per tonne (real 2022), that increases to 108 USD per tonne by 2030 and stays flat thereafter. In countries with higher carbon costs, we use the country-specific cost expectations. This carbon cost is included in investment decisions and is part of break-even calculations when testing for profitability robustness. The actual CO\u2082 costs for Equinor-operated assets were USD 1,019 million in 2022 5 .\n\n## Carbon cost relative to base assumptions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe illustration above shows the total carbon cost in the WEO scenarios, relative to the total cost using Equinor's commodity price assumptions, based on the same volume base. All the WEO scenarios predict lower\n\nabsolute carbon costs compared to Equinor's assumed CO\u2082 cost. With Equinor's ambition to reduce operated scope 1 and 2 emissions by net 50% by 2030 relative to 2015, this further supports the adaptation to a lowcarbon future.\n\n## Physical Climate Risk\n\nEquinor's portfolio comprises o/ffshore and onshore assets across a diverse set of regions around the world. While the company's core business is centred on the NCS, the internationalisation of the oil and gas portfolio and the move towards a broad energy company has seen an expansion in the company's geographic footprint. The IPCC's sixth assessment report finds that 'climate change is bringing multiple di/fferent changes in di/fferent regions - which will all increase with further warming'. These include changes to wetness and dryness, to winds, snow and ice, coastal areas and oceans. To assess the exposure of our assets to possible climate-related perils we modeled the portfolio to di/fferent climate scenarios using data analytics software. The model assessed the exposure of 118 assets in which Equinor has an equity interest to six climate-related perils: wind, heat, fire, flood, hail and precipitation, providing details on both presentday exposure and the expected change in exposure between 2020 and 2050.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Portfolio exposure\u00b9 to physical climate risk perils according to the RCP 8.5\u00b2 climate scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b9 Bubble size based on relative size of the book value of assets \u00b2 RCP8.5 is a high emission scenario representing a high emissions future without e/ffective climate change mitigation\n\npolicies.\n\nThe results of the assessment can be seen in the figure above, which also shows the relative book value of di/fferent clusters of assets by reporting segment. The results show that the majority of Equinor's assets by book value are subject to a relatively low level of present and future climate-related exposure. Those\n\nassets subject to the highest present-day exposure are o/ffshore installations in the US Gulf of Mexico, while those with the greatest changes in exposure towards 2050 are the renewable installations in South America. Similar results were found for both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 warming scenarios. While the assessment provides details on the exposure of assets, it is not a direct indication of physical or financial-related risk as all Equinor installations are designed with margins to tolerate a range of meteorological conditions. Installation-specific risk assessments are therefore required to assess the climate risk and to implement mitigating measures (if required). We will continue to assess the current and future exposure of our portfolio to physical climate changes and to implement preventative and mitigating measures.\n\n## Profitable portfolio\n\nBy carefully evaluating investment criteria to develop our future portfolio and assessing our current portfolio for physical climate risk exposure, we can ensure we have resilient value creating assets able to be profitable through challenging market conditions and climate scenarios. It also empowers us with knowledge to implement any measures to ensure we are profitable for the future and able to create value for shareholders through capital allocation and distribution.",

(adjusted\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nto USD/NOK exchange rate assumption in the Outlook presented at CMU 2022, organic capital expenditures* were USD 8.3 billion).\n\nIn 2021, capital expenditures were USD 8.5 billion, as per note 5 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements, of which organic capital expenditures* amounted to USD 8.1 billion.\n\nAmbition met in 2022\n\nAmbition not met in 2022\n\nPlan in  place,  on  track  to  reach  longer-term ambition\n\n- Plan in place, not on track to reach longer-term ambition\n\nIn Norway, a substantial proportion of 2023 capital expenditures will be spent on ongoing development projects such as the Johan Castberg and the Breidablikk and fields with final investment decisions where plans for development and operation (PDOs) have been submitted, such as Munin (formerly Krafla), Halten \u00d8st and Irpa. In addition, capital expenditures will be spent on various extensions, modifications and improvements on currently producing fields.\n\nInternationally, we estimate that a substantial proportion of 2023 capital expenditures will be spent on ongoing and planned development projects such as the Bacalhau field in Brazil and o/ffshore and nonoperated onshore activity in the USA.\n\nWithin renewable energy, capital expenditure in 2023 is expected to be spent mainly on o/ffshore wind projects and on the acquisition of the solar developer BeGreen announced in November 2022.\n\nEquinor finances its capital expenditures both internally and externally. For more information, see financial debt and liquidity management in the section 2.2 High value.\n\nEquinor has committed to certain investments in the future. A large part of the capital expenditure for 2023 is committed. The further into the future, the more flexibility we will have to revise expenditures. This flexibility is partially dependent on the expenditure joint venture partners agree to commit to. For\n\nfurther information, see note 26 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquinor may alter the amount, timing or segmental or project allocation of capital expenditures in anticipation of, or as a result of several factors outside our control.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (ROACE)*\n\nThe return on average capital employed (ROACE)* was 55.2% in 2022, compared to 22.7% in 2021. The change from 2021 was mainly due to the increase in adjusted earnings* after tax.\n\n## Relative ROACE* (peer group rank)\n\nOn relative ROACE* Equinor was ranked 1 st in the peer group, which is a position in the first quartile.\n\n## Relative TSR\n\nEquinor assesses performance against a peer group of 11 European and U.S. companies by relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). TSR is the sum of a share's price growth and dividends for the same period, divided by the share price at the beginning of the period and is provided by a third-party service provider.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Equinor is number six with a TSR of 40% (measured in USD).\n\nThe year 2022 was weak for global equity markets but a strong year for oil and gas equities. The strong outperformance for energy markets in 2022 was primarily caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to a shortfall in European supply, which had a profound impact on European prices for gas and electricity. This resulted in increased earnings, cash flow and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nshare price for companies with exposure to European gas markets. No company stood out like Equinor, resulting in very strong relative performance until early September. In the last months of 2022, Equinor showed weaker relative performance due to a fall in European gas prices. This was due to warmer than expected European weather, and the fact that European storage was no longer a big concern for the 2022-2023 winter as European countries were able to find alternative supplies and eventually refilled their gas storage.\n\nTotal shareholder return* in %\n\n## Total shareholder return* in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the relative performance of Equinor over the five years from 2018 until 2022.

The turbulent times of 2022 have reinforced our belief in our long-standing purpose and the importance of the value we bring to people and society, being a reliable provider of energy to our customers while continuing to take vital steps in our transition.\n\nEnergy underpins virtually all current economic activity and is a fundamental human well-being and development component. The jobs we create, taxes we pay and the economic and social benefits we deliver are material contributions Equinor provides to society at large and to the communities in which we are present.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nAlongside our tax contributions, a main lever to deliver value to society is through the procurement of goods and services of approximately 7,500 direct suppliers and their sub-suppliers. Thriving domestic supply chains are important for regional economic development and for Equinor as we deliver new projects and invest in long-term infrastructure that will operate for decades. Helping to develop new supply chains is as important as ensuring that our existing suppliers are transitioning along with us to balance creating new jobs and the minimising job losses in the value chain and beyond our industry.\n\nAt the core of our e/fforts to deliver value to society is openness and collaboration with stakeholders and partners to understand their needs and expectations and to help find mutual benefits and lasting solutions to common challenges.\n\n## Management approach\n\nHost communities and value chain partners are key stakeholders in identifying and delivering societal value.\n\nIdentification of opportunities starts at the early stages of business development. Local authorities and non-governmental organisations help us understand the needs and expectations of our host communities. These are key to informing business models and project strategies that can deliver lasting value to the community and its support of our activities.\n\nIn addition to tax contributions and procurement spending, we deliver socioeconomic benefits such as voluntary or mandatory social investments, sponsorships and donations. In 2022, we prioritised our e/fforts towards education and vocational training, institutional capacity building, cultural enrichment and support for humanitarian aid. All social investments must comply with internal policies and requirements as well as local regulations.\n\nWe measure our performance towards tax contributions and spend on procurement, social investments, sponsorships and donations.\n\nTowards the end of 2022, we launched our Just Transition plan and our commitment to contributing to an energy transition that is just and inclusive and brings long-term social and economic benefits. See\n\nequinor.com for more information about our approach and priorities, including supporting case studies that exemplify how we deliver value to societies accordingly. As we implement this plan, we will evolve our performance framework on material topics, including defining relevant ambitions.\n\nActual and potential adverse impacts related to our business activities are further addressed in other parts of the report, more specifically in Emissions reductions, Integrity and anti-corruption, Safe and secure operations, Protecting nature, and Tackling inequality Human rights.\n\n## Performance disclosure\n\nAlongside the provision of reliable energy, we continue creating economic value and societal progress through avenues such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenues for countries through the taxes we pay\n- \u00b7 Economic opportunities for our direct suppliers and sub-suppliers and further revenues for countries through our sourcing of goods and services\n- \u00b7 Job creation, training, skills development, and educational investments and enhancement of opportunities for own workforce and beyond\n- \u00b7 Innovation, research and development of technologies",

Together.\n\n## Enabling societal progress through tax contributions\n\nPaying the right tax where value is created is central to Equinor's commitment to contributing to progress for societies. In 2022, the Equinor group paid USD 45 billion in corporate income taxes and USD 4 billion in royalty payments and fees to local and national governments, including host entitlement. USD 44 billion was paid in Norway, where Equinor has the largest share of its operations and earnings.\n\nThe full Payments to governments report for 2022 pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-3d\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nand the Norwegian Security Trading Act \u00a75-5a can be found at our website: equinor.com/reports. We published our second tax contribution report in October 2022, which provides further insight into our approach to tax and explains why and where we pay the taxes we pay.\n\n## Procurement and ripple e/ffects\n\nEnabling local value creation is integrated into how we plan and operate our activities across all parts of our strategy. A significant contribution to society in terms of monetary value is our purchase of goods and services, totalling approx. USD 17.1 billion in 2022. Continued sourcing from key suppliers enables them to make longterm plans and investments in securing and creating jobs, developing new skills and technology and investing in their own supply chains.\n\nIn Norway, according to a report by Bod\u00f8 Science Park, we procured goods and services for our operations from over 1,800 suppliers in 152 Norwegian municipalities in 2021, totalling NOK 77 billion. 90% of all deliveries were by Norwegian suppliers, demonstrating their capacity, competence and competitiveness.\n\nIn the UK, our upcoming project Rosebank, according to a socioeconomic study by Wood Mackenzie and V\u00e5r Energi, if sanctioned, is estimated to create GBP 8.1 billion of direct investment, of which GBP 6.3 billion is likely to be invested in UK-based businesses. Over the 25 years lifetime of the field, Rosebank is forecast to generate a total of GBP 24.1 billion of gross value add (GVA), comprised of direct, indirect and induced economic impacts.\n\n## Enabling local opportunities in o/ffshore wind projects\n\nSpecifically related to floating wind, Equinor has developed a set of design principles and a toolbox to help select solutions that are both cost-e/ffective and provide opportunities for the local supply chain. Water depths, capabilities of local harbours, and the competence and capacity of the local supply chain are some of the main drivers when we consider the technology of choice.\n\nIn Norway, the local supply chain has been awarded over 50% of Hywind Tampen's contract value by being competitive in the chosen technologies. This contributes to job creation and local economic value and builds know-how for future industrial projects.",

During 2022, Equinor led six supply chain workshops to prepare local suppliers for future tenders and collaborating around skills and innovation. Equinor entered into a number of strategic collaborations in North-East England including with the O/ffshore Renewable Energy Catapult, a UKwide initiative for innovation in renewable energy.\n\n## Social investments\n\nIn 2022, we spent around USD 6.3 million on social investments internationally, the majority in which were contractual obligations. The investments were often targeted towards underprivileged groups and focused on STEM education and vocational training and skills building to improve employability, as well as healthcare and economic empowerment for women. In 2022, material contributions included support to infrastructure development in Argentina, and support to local capacity building and innovation through our o/ffshore wind projects, Empire Wind and Beacon Wind, in the US. An overview of Equinor's social investments in 2022 is presented in our ESG data hub.\n\n## Supporting humanitarian e/fforts in a turbulent year\n\nWith 2022 marked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a growing humanitarian crisis in its wake, Equinor donated\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\na total of USD 5 million to humanitarian organisations supporting the people in and refugees from Ukraine, as well as organisations working to alleviate the hunger crisis on the Horn of Africa, that was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn Poland, we supported joint industry initiatives to provide technical assistance and technical equipment to Ukrainian organisations. We also provided financial aid to support refugees that will remain in the country for a longer period through partnering with local NGOs, including those cooperating with UN bodies, like the Polish Centre for International Aid and United Nations Global Compact Poland.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nOverall, our performance on value creation for society was geared towards ensuring crucial energy production and supply, and providing significant tax contributions, employment and procurement spending. Alongside these, we extended humanitarian aid to support direct and indirect victims of the war in Ukraine and continued our local community engagement in the countries of our operations.\n\nLooking ahead, we will pursue opportunities to further strengthen our activities, performance and disclosures, notably as a part of our just transition plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that an ethical business culture is the cornerstone of a sustainable company, and we continued our work on ethics and compliance throughout 2022. Our commitment to conduct business in an ethical, socially responsible and transparent manner remained constant, irrespective of the impact of the the European security situation.\n\nEquinor has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of corruption. This is embedded across the company through our values, Code of Conduct and compliance programmes.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- Plan in place, not on track to reach longer-term ambition\n\n## Management approach\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Equinor Code of Conduct sets out our commitment and requirements for how we do business. It applies to our employees, board members and hired personnel who, each year, are required to confirm that they understand and will comply with the Code of Conduct and take an online test to certify as competent. We expect our suppliers to act in a way that is consistent with our Code of Conduct and we engage with them to help them understand our ethical requirements and how we do business. If our expectations are not met, we take appropriate action.\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery and corruption in any form. Equinor's anticorruption compliance programme summarises the standards, requirements and procedures implemented to comply with applicable laws and regulations and maintain our high ethical standards. The programme lays down the foundation for ensuring that anti-bribery and corruption risks are identified, concerns are reported, and measures are taken to mitigate risk in all parts of the organisation. We have a global network of compliance o/fficers who support the business in identifying and handling business integrity risks and ensure that ethical and anti-corruption considerations are integrated into our activities no matter where they take place. Equinor provides regular training across the organisation to build awareness and understanding of the anti-corruption compliance programme.\n\n## Competition and antitrust compliance\n\nEquinor's Code of Conduct also addresses the requirement to comply with applicable competition and antitrust laws. Our competition and antitrust programme consists of governing documents and manuals, and training of employees in high-risk positions, as well as regular risk assessments and assurance activities.\n\n## Reporting and handling of concerns\n\nThe Code of Conduct imposes a duty to report possible violations of the Code or other incidents of unethical conduct. We require leaders to take their control\n\nresponsibilities seriously to prevent, detect and respond to ethical issues. Employees are encouraged to discuss concerns with their line manager or the line manager's superior, or use available internal channels established to provide support. Concerns may also be reported through our Ethics Helpline which allows for anonymous reporting and is open to employees, business partners and the general public. Equinor has a strict nonretaliation policy.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe legal business ethics and compliance function is headed by the chief ethics and compliance o/fficer (CECO), who reports to the executive vice president legal and compliance. The CECO is also able to report matters directly to the CEO, the BoD, the audit committee (BAC) and the safety, sustainability, ethics committee (SSEC).\n\n## Collaboration and stakeholder engagement\n\nAt Equinor, we believe in the value of collective action to actively promote anti-corruption and revenue transparency. We have long standing relationships with the UN Global Compact, the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and Transparency International (TI). In 2022, as a long-standing supporter of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), we continued to participate actively in the EITI multi-stakeholder process with the clear objective of strengthening revenue transparency and good governance in the sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since the signing of the Paris agreement, the scientific and physical evidence of climate change has become ever more apparent. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, the world's energy systems will need to undergo a transformation in the coming years to decarbonise. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report, 'reducing GHG emissions across the full energy sector requires major transitions, including a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, the deployment of low-emission energy sources, switching to alternative energy carriers, and energy e/fficiency and conservation'. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that clean energy investment must rise above USD 4 trillion by 2030 for the world to be on track to meet its Net Zero Emissions by 2030 scenario 6 . Companies, customers, governments and society at large will all have to collaborate, innovate and adapt in\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nnew ways to ensure a sustainable future. It will require the development of new technologies, new value chains, and new ways of working, as well as firm leadership from policymakers. It will also require continuity and the provision of stable, reliable and a/ffordable energy that the global economy depends on.\n\n## Our response\n\nEquinor is committed to long-term value creation in support of the goals of the Paris Agreement. We aim to be a leading company in the energy transition and have set an ambition to reach net zero by 2050. We realise that this will be a journey that will require an evolution of the way energy is produced and consumed globally.\n\nAs an industrial company focused on the production and delivery of oil, gas, electricity and low-carbon products and services, our business has both direct and indirect negative impacts. Our operations generate significant greenhouse gas emissions (in 2022, for example, we emitted 11.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO \u2082 e) from our own operations). And, of course, the emissions associated with the use of the products we sell are many times higher than those from our direct operations, equivalent to 243 million tonnes of CO 2 e in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We have already developed an upstream portfolio that is one of the most carbon e/fficient in the industry. Our ambition to reduce net group-wide operated scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, shows that we are focused on medium-term actions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a 1.5-degree pathway.\n\nRapidly reducing our own emissions is necessary, but not su/fficient. To be an e/ffective agent of change in the energy transition, we must help society decarbonise by providing our customers and end-users with energy that has lower - and eventually net-zero - emissions. To achieve this, we have to apply our experience and competence from oil and gas to new sectors of the energy system. We have built a robust o/ffshore wind portfolio and aim to further strengthen our leading position in floating o/ffshore wind. We are shaping the low carbon industry, leveraging our advantaged industrial starting point on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and proximity to the European market.\n\nEquinor's 2022 Energy transition plan laid out our strategy for delivering on our ambition to become a net-zero company by 2050, including emissions from production and final consumption of the energy we produce. In addition to the main corporate decarbonisation and transition ambitions, the plan included a series of short-term industrial project milestones that demonstrated our concrete commitment to delivering our transition strategy. A summary of progress against the Energy Transition Plan can be found in the introductory sections of this report and more detail on our net zero pathway and emissions reductions is provided below.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo deliver on our transition strategy we have put in place a framework for climate-related risk management that is informed by the concept of double materiality. Equinor assesses climate risk from two perspectives: transition risk, which assesses the financial robustness of the company's business model and portfolio in various decarbonisation scenarios; and\n\nphysical climate risk, which assesses the vulnerability of our assets to climate-related perils in di/fferent warming scenarios. A full description of how we integrate climate considerations into our investment and valuation criteria, and details of our CO\u2082 price forecasts is published in presented in section 2.2.2 Profitable portfolio. To assess and manage climate-related risks we also use scenario and sensitivity analysis, including\n\nnet present value (NPV) stress tests against all relevant scenarios published by the IEA. Details of our stress testing and scenario analysis are published in section 2.2.2 Profitable portfolio. For physical climate risk, we map the exposure of our global asset portfolio against a range of climate-related perils and scenarios, including heat, flood, fire, and wind. The results of the 2022 mapping can be seen in section 2.2.2 Profitable portfolio.\n\nEquinor aligns its climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and we include explicit reference to the TCFD recommendations in section 5.6.\n\n## Using our voice\n\nOur advocacy and policy engagement is also conducted in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Equinor promotes policies supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement and forceful actions to accelerate the energy transition. We also actively work to ensure that the policy positions and advocacy of our membership organisations is supportive of and aligned with the objectives Paris Agreement. To ensure transparency, we conduct and publish an annual review of industry association and membership organisations showing any areas of potential misalignment. Our climate policy positions and our expectations of our membership associations are available on Equinor.com. We engage with a wide range of external independent benchmarking and assessment organisations, including Climate Action 100+, CDP, InfluenceMap and others, in an e/ffort to be a proactive stakeholder in the development of e/ffective frameworks for assessing corporate performance in the energy transition.",

The Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) metric tracks our net emissions, including scope 3 emissions from the use of our products, in relation to our total energy\n\n## Investing in a broad energy portfolio to accelerate systemic transformation\n\nTo meet the climate challenge while also addressing the need for energy, Equinor has developed a metric that shows how we are progressing towards our own\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nproduction from oil, gas, electricity, and hydrogen. Using a combination of all of the options available to us as a broad energy company, our NCI metric shows how we will deliver energy with lower emissions over time, helping our customers in their e/fforts to deliver emission reductions. Our ambition is to reduce our NCI of 67.8g CO\u2082e/MJ in 2019 by 20% by 2030 and by 40% by 2035. By 2050, we aim to bring the NCI down by 100% - to net zero. Equinor's interim NCI ambitions show reductions by 2030 and 2035 greater than those implied by the IEA's Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which assumes that all climate commitments made by governments around the world as of COP26, including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and longer-term netzero targets, will be met in full and on time.\n\nOur strategy for achieving net zero has been informed by engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, including shareholder and shareholder groups, government, non-governmental organisations, academia, and civil society.\n\nIn addition to the products and services we provide to our customers, we recognise that we have the potential to have a positive impact on global emissions reduction through engagement with our suppliers. As a major consumer of goods and services, Equinor has the opportunity to drive emissions reductions among\n\nits suppliers and sub-suppliers. Our Energy transition plan included a commitment to 'work with our suppliers and customers, host governments, and civil society to develop the business models, policies and frameworks to enable the world to achieve net zero by 2050'.\n\n## Management approach\n\nEquinor is applying its competitive advantage to create value in new areas of the energy system and to deliver on our net zero ambition. We have an ambition to allocate more than 50% of our gross capital expenditure to renewables and low-carbon solutions by 2030. A central element in this e/ffort is our ambition to become a leading global player in o/ffshore wind. We will accelerate growth in renewables to strengthen our competitive position and achieve the economies of scale necessary to improve returns. To build a competitive wind portfolio, we are applying our experience in technology, innovation and project delivery and building new competence and capacity to support the transition. We have an ambition to have a total of 12-16 GW of installed equity-based renewable capacity 7 by 2030.\n\nTo complete our development as a broad energy company, we are building a platform for growth in low carbon solutions with a focus on hydrogen and",

        "page_content": "CCS. This is a natural next step for Equinor: a way for us to decarbonise our supplies of energy and to help industrial end-users realise their climate ambitions. Building on our strong position in industrial value chains in Europe, we are applying our technical and engineering competence to bring low-carbon products and services to the market. We are developing a broad funnel of options to be at the forefront of maturing these decarbonisation markets over the next ten years. We have established early positioning in CCS licences and high-impact hydrogen projects in Northwest Europe, working with commercial partners and governments to create new value chains. We have an ambition of developing a CO\u2082 transport and storage capacity of 5-10 million tonnes by 2030 and 15-30 million tonnes by 2035.\n\nOur success in achieving our net zero ambition will require collaboration with partners, customers, suppliers, and host governments on the necessary actions to accelerate the energy transition. Such collaboration takes the form of engagement and advocacy on policy issues; strategic partnerships with companies across the energy value chain; dialogue and commercial agreement with customers; consultation and investment in host communities; engagement with suppliers and sub-suppliers; and participation in initiatives with academia, NGOs, and other stakeholders.\n\nSuccess also requires an internal governance and performance framework that is informed by our transition ambitions. Equinor's remuneration framework contributes to the business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability of the company. In order to better reflect Equinor's strategy and the energy transition, the\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ninstructions for the BoD compensation and executive development committee were updated in 2020 to include climate and energy transition-related goals as part of the remuneration policies. The CEO, his direct reports and Equinor's wider leadership are assessed based on results within a broad range of topics, including safety, security and sustainability. The ability of executive leaders to be role models and drive the energy transition forward forms part of the holistic performance evaluation.\n\n## Investing in the future energy system\n\nTo deliver on our medium-term ambitions on the route to net zero, we are positioning ourselves through project execution, organic business opportunities, strategic business development and through the establishment of commercial agreements and investments in low-carbon value chains. In 2022 we increased our share of gross capital expenditure* to renewables and low carbon solutions to 14%, up from 11% in 2021. In our renewables business, we demonstrated real progress in 2022 on both project execution and on building the portfolio pipeline. In addition to laying the first foundations at the Dogger Bank o/ffshore wind farm in the UK and completion of the St\u0119pie\u0144 solar project in Poland, we put in place further building blocks for our renewables strategy. Equinor's selection as a provisional winner of a lease area on the Outer continental shelf o/ff California provides us with a platform to deliver on our goal of becoming an o/ffshore wind major in one of the world's most attractive growth regions for floating o/ffshore wind, while the acquisition of BeGreen, a Danish solar developer with a strong project pipeline enables will enable us to deliver on our goal of becoming a market-driven power producer.

        "page_content": "of continued progress in developing the value chains that will enable hydrogen and CCS to be key enablers in the energy transition. Commercial agreements and partnerships with key European peers and counterparties - in particular the world's first crossborder CO 2 transportation between the Northern Lights partnership and fertiliser company Yara - show that we are progressing the business models to take forward the LCS portfolio. Awards of new CO 2 storage licenses in Norway and the UK as well as government support for pioneering cluster projects such as H2H Saltend were key enablers to deliver on our ambition to deliver on our 2030 and 2035 ambitions for CCS and hydrogen.\n\n## Net Carbon Intensity\n\nOur 1% reduction in net carbon intensity in 2022 compared to 2021 (66.5 down from 67.1) was driven mainly by the relative increase in the share of gas to oil production in our production portfolio. Despite increasing our share of gross capital expenditure to renewables and low carbon solutions, the contribution of renewable energy in our portfolio remained relatively unchanged from 2021, reflecting the long lead times of the capital cycle between investment and commissioning. Similarly, the amount of CO\u2082 that we transported and stored in 2022 was 0.5 million tonnes. This is higher than in 2021 but lower than the historical 5-year average. The main reason for the lower CO\u2082 transport and storage levels is the shutdown of the Hammerfest LNG terminal for repairs until June 2022 and the reduced CO\u2082 injection at the Sleipner field. Both renewable output and CO\u2082 storage and transport volumes will increase in the coming years as projects\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nreach maturity. The reduction in our scope 3 emissions from use of products sold was principally due to a reduction in our overall equity production volumes. The addition of the Triton CCGT power generation plant did not materially a/ffect the portfolio-wide NCI.\n\n## Supply chain decarbonisation\n\nFor the first time in 2022, we engaged a systematic evaluation of our supplier base to assess emission reduction plans and strategies. Among those suppliers that account for the majority of Equinor's procurement spend, 65% were found to have a stated emissions reduction target on an absolute or intensity basis by 2030. We will continue to work with suppliers and subsuppliers to increase this share and to explore tools and ways of working to increase transparency and reduce emissions across our supply chain.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nOur performance in 2022 shows that Equinor is building the foundation to deliver on its net zero ambitions. As a leading indicator, capital allocation is the metric that showed the most progress in 2022 as we increased the share of gross capex* to low and zero carbon activities. Given the long lead times needed to bring renewable and low-carbon projects onstream, we saw relatively little progress in the generation from renewable energy sources or the volumes of carbon stored and transported in 2022. Consequently, there was relatively little change in the company's overall net carbon intensity. The 2% reduction in NCI from the 2019 baseline is in line with expectations. As deployment of renewable and CCS accelerates in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncoming years, we expect to see greater progress in NCI reductions, with the majority of progress towards the 20% reduction ambition in 2030 expected in the second half of this decade. Meeting the 2030 and 2035 NCI ambitions will put us well ahead of society's progress towards net zero in 2050 as outlined in our Energy transition plan. Equinor's ability to deliver on its transition ambitions and its net 2050 ambition will continue to be dependent on enabling policy and regulatory frameworks. The changed energy security situation in Europe has resulted in both positive and\n\nnegative drivers for Equinor's energy transition. Increased demand for oil and, particularly, natural gas raise expectations for continued hydrocarbon production, while increased policy support for renewables and low-carbon solutions are likely to accelerate their deployment in both Europe and the US. Mapping of the decarbonisation targets of our strategic suppliers in 2022 represented the first step in an important e/ffort to increase transparency and focus on emissions in upstream scope 3 emissions; this will be a continued area of focus and improvement in 2023.",

These energy sources will be needed to power the global economy for many years to come, including in every independent scenario of what would be needed for a Paris-aligned emissions trajectory. In addition to being primary sources of energy, oil and gas will also be needed as input to low-carbon fuels for hard-to-abate sectors such as blue hydrogen and as feedstocks for non-energy applications such as chemicals. The IEA's analysis\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nfrom October 2022 shows that global oil demand is expected to grow in 2023 by 1.7 million barrels per day (mmbpd) to over 101mmbpd. The IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) in 2050 scenario, which assumes demand levels consistent with a 1.5-degree trajectory, shows global oil demand projected to decline at 2.5% per year from 2021 to around 72 million barrels per day in 2030 and 24mbpd in 2050. The IEA also sees growing demand for natural gas in the short term, including in it its NZE scenario, which was developed before the current energy crisis and the attempts to reduce reliance on Russian energy exports. To meet the needs of society, Equinor will continue to produce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noil and gas for the foreseeable future. We aim to excel in operational emissions management, maximising the e/fficiency of our infrastructure on the NCS and optimising our high-quality international portfolio. To earn the right to supply the oil and gas the world demands, we are continuing to improve the industryleading carbon e/fficiency of our production.\n\nOur ambition to reduce net group-wide operated emissions by 50% by 2030, shows that we are focused on bringing down our direct operated emissions in line with reductions necessary for a 1.5-degree pathway. Setting a baseline year that corresponds to the year of the Paris Agreement enables us to show our early action on emissions reduction and to build on our leadership position throughout this decade. The ambition, which was announced at our 2022 capital market update, was informed by engagement with a range of government and non-government stakeholders and will enable us to contribute to national decarbonisation plans in key host jurisdictions, including Norway's ambition to reduce its emissions by 55% by 2030 relative to a 1990 baseline.\n\n## Management approach\n\nReaching our 50% reduction ambition for operated scope 1 and 2 emissions will require a focused and coordinated e/ffort across the company on executing and maturing a portfolio of abatement projects, improving energy e/fficiency of o/ffshore and onshore\n\nassets, developing new technologies, and strengthening resilience in the portfolio, including through consolidation. The abatement projects primarily include electrification of o/ffshore assets in Norway, mainly by power from shore but also including innovations such as Hywind Tampen. Projects in the abatement portfolio are selected, developed and executed in close dialogue with authorities and partners and coordinated through our Norway Energy Hub initiative. In addition to CO 2 emissions, we have instituted a renewed focus on improving our industry-leading performance on methane emissions, with increased emphasis on site-level measurement for improved quantification and reporting. Carbon o/ffsets will play a minimal role in achieving this ambition, with at least 90% of the reductions being met through absolute emissions reductions. In the longer term, we see negative emissions solutions and o/ffsets as making an important contribution to address the climate challenge. We plan to use only carbon credits verified according to high standards and to disclose information about the type of o/ffsets employed. To ensure quality in our carbon credits, we have established a set of corporate criteria and principles based on the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon O/ffsetting.\n\nTo track and incentivise the company's performance on decarbonisation, we have established a performance indicator that assesses progress towards the 2030 decarbonisation ambition. The indicator is the first of its kind in Equinor to use a forecast-based methodology.",

        "page_content": "The indicator tracks the internal forecast for Equinor's operated GHG emissions in 2030 relative to the reduction level required to meet the decarbonisation ambition, as well as progress on the portfolio of abatement projects. The indicator was implemented as an internal corporate KPI in 2023.\n\nIn addition to our absolute emissions reduction e/fforts, we are focused on continuing to improve the industryleading carbon and methane e/fficiency of our profitable upstream portfolio, enabling us to be the resilient and responsible producer of the oil and gas that the world demands. Performance on the upstream CO 2 intensity of the oil and gas portfolio is integrated as a KPI for the BoD and CEC and is linked renumeration. The same KPI also informs renumeration for business-unit managers as well as an input into the general bonus for all employees.\n\n## Operated emissions\n\nIn 2022 Equinor was on track to meet its ambitions to halve its operated scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. Our total operated scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for 2022 were 11.4 million tonnes - a 6% decrease from the previous year. Equinor has now achieved a reduction in absolute operated scope 1 and 2 emissions of around 30% relative to 2015.\n\nThe main drivers of our reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions were a combination of operational and portfolio measures including: divestment of our Kalundborg refinery and Bakken asset; modifications and emissions reduction initiatives at our onshore plants at Mongstad and K\u00e5rst\u00f8; and a change in strategy at several of our NCS assets from gas injection to gas exports to maximise supplies to Europe.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9

We also saw positive contributions to our emissions reductions e/fforts through energy e/fficiency projects in Norway, which reduced emissions by 200,000 tonnes, and from our international portfolio including the Peregrino gas import solution, which is expected to avoid around 100,000 tonnes of CO 2 emissions per year in operated emissions.\n\nFigure: Operated CO 2 intensity 2022 vs 6-year performance and 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure: Operated scope 1 + scope 2 emissions 2022 vs 2021 with key levers/contributions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure: End 2022 forecast for operated emissions to 2030.\n\n## Equity emissions\n\nEquinor's equity CO 2 emissions in 2022 were 9.1 million tonnes, a decrease from 9.9 in 2021.

This year, for the first time, we also provide field-based emissions for our international\n\npartner-operated assets in the USA, Canada, and other jurisdictions where we have approval from partners. We continue to work with our partners to encourage emissions disclosure on a field basis and have requested consent to publish emissions data from all partners from whom it is required.\n\n## Upstream intensity\n\nIn 2022, Equinor was on track to meet its ambitions with regard to upstream CO 2 intensity. The upstream CO\u2082 intensity of Equinor's operated portfolio decreased from 7.0 to 6.9kg CO\u2082/boe, well below the 2025 ambition of 8kg CO\u2082/boe. The main driver for this change was reduced CO 2 levels from operated Norwegian assets which changed their strategy from gas injection to gas export during 2022. There were also significant emissions reductions measures implemented in the upstream portfolio in 2022 (202,000 tonnes CO 2 ), as well as decommissioning of the Veslefrikk field and divestment of the Bakken asset in the United States, both of which had higher than average upstream emissions intensity. Increased production levels from the electrified asset Martin Linge also have a positive e/ffect on the intensity.\n\n## Upstream CO\u2082 intensity\n\n(kg CO\u2082 per boe, 100% operated basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpstream: All operations from exploration to production, excluding onshore gas processing and LNG facilities.",

This is significantly\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlower than the industry average of 9 (IOGP 2021). Equinor's low flaring levels are due to continued focus on operational e/fficiency and leveraging the well-established gas infrastructure in Norway. The main reason for the reduced flaring levels in 2022 was decreased flaring from Martin Linge (which experienced start-up flaring in 2021), decommissioning of Veslefrikk B, turnaround maintenance at Statfjord A, the divestment of the Bakken asset, and the implementation of several emission reduction initiatives.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n2022 saw positive progress in Equinor's performance to reduce its absolute operated scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as a continued focus on maintaining industryleading performance on the carbon and methane intensity of its upstream oil and gas portfolio. While portfolio changes and production strategy were significant contributors to the reduction in operated emissions and emissions intensity in 2022, Equinor made\n\nprogress throughout the year in advancing abatement projects to bring emissions down in line with the 2030 ambition. The newly developed forecast indicator shows that the operated portfolio is currently on track to meet the company's 50% reduction ambition by 2030, despite a forecasted increase in emissions in 2025 due to new production projects coming onstream.",

Throughout the year, Equinor, together with licence partners and Norwegian authorities, took several new steps to respond to the rising need for natural gas in Europe and increased gas production by 8% in 2022.\n\nGoing forward, Equinor will continue to add highvalue barrels to the portfolio through exploration and increased recovery. A particular focus will be given to gas. Hence, NCS cash flow and value creation are expected to remain high beyond 2030. In 2022 Equinor was awarded 26 new production licences and several high-value discoveries were made close to existing infrastructure. Four tie-in projects reached investment decisions in 2022, adding value and increasing the lifespan of existing infrastructure. An investment decision was also made for the Munin project. The NCS project portfolio is very robust against potential low oil and gas prices.\n\nThe CO\u2082 abatement portfolio is progressing towards the ambition of 50% emissions reduction from operations in Norway by 2030. Investment decisions were made for both the Njord and Sn\u00f8hvit future electrification projects. The Oseberg gas capacity and power-from-shore project got PDO approval\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nin the fourth quarter of 2022. In November the first power was produced from the Hywind Tampen floating o/ffshore wind farm that will supply the Snorre and the Gullfaks facilities.\n\nNorway energy hub - the plan to transform the NCS into a broad energy province - saw good progress. Equinor together with Oseberg and Troll licence partners, are in an early phase of developing a floating o/ffshore wind farm intended to provide electric power to Kollsnes and the Troll and Oseberg fields via an onshore connection point. Blue hydrogen and CCS projects were significantly strengthened through the award of the Smeaheia CO\u2082 storage licence and agreements on cross-border collaboration.\n\n## Transforming the value of international oil and gas\n\nEquinor has built its international oil and gas portfolio over the past 30 years, with an equity production of about 0.652 million boe per day in 2022. In the past few years, Equinor has made significant progress to focus and optimise its international oil and gas portfolio through divestments and country exits. In the portfolio of assets in production, the focus is on safe and e/fficient operations, including measures to reduce carbon emissions. The portfolio of major development projects continues to be further matured and optimised.\n\nIn 2022, Equinor completed its exit process from Russia. In Brazil, the Peregrino field and its expansion,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeregrino phase 2, came into production. The Roncador field started producing additional volumes from an IOR project. The major development project Bacalhau continued to progress. Meanwhile, in the USA, portfolio optimisation onshore (Northeastern USA) and o/ffshore (US Gulf of Mexico) performed well. In the Gulf of Mexico, Equinor continues to materially build position with the Vito development, operated by Shell. Onshore, the significant low-carbon gas positions in the Appalachian Basin continue to generate strong\n\ncash flows. Presence in this region has allowed Equinor to spearhead initiatives that could unlock future CCS and hydrogen opportunities together with key industrial players.",

These changes are the result of continuous business processes and can be expected to continue to a/ffect reserves in the future.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nProved reserves can also be added or subtracted through purchases and sales of reserves-in-place or factors outside management control.\n\nChanges in oil and gas prices can a/ffect the quantities of oil and gas that can be recovered from the accumulations. Higher oil and gas prices will normally allow more oil and gas to be recovered, while lower prices will normally result in reduced recovery. However, for fields with production sharing agreements (PSA), higher prices may result in reduced entitlement to produced volumes and lower prices may result in increased entitlement to produced volumes. These described changes are included in the revisions and improved recovery (IOR) category in the tables that follows in this report.\n\nThe principles for booking proved gas reserves are limited to contracted gas sales or gas with access to a robust gas market.\n\nEquinor prepares its disclosures for oil and gas reserves and certain other supplemental oil and gas disclosures by geographical area, as required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The geographical areas are defined by country and continent. These are Norway, Eurasia excluding Norway, Africa, the USA and the Americas excluding USA.\n\nIn Norway and other countries where there is reasonable certainty that the authorities will approve the plan for development and operation (PDO), Equinor recognises reserves as proved when the PDO is submitted to the authorities. Otherwise, reserves are generally booked as proved reserves when regulatory approval is received, or when such approval is imminent. Undrilled well locations in onshore fields in the USA are generally booked as proved undeveloped reserves when a development plan has been adopted and the well locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nApproximately 87% of Equinor's proved reserves are located in the Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries. Norway is by far the most important contributor in this category, followed by the USA. Of Equinor's total proved reserves, 5% are related to PSAs in non-OECD countries such as Angola, Brazil, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya. Other proved non-OECD reserves are related to concession fields in Argentina and Brazil, representing all together 7% of Equinor's total proved reserves.\n\n## Distribution of proved reserves\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase is the result of 433 million boe in positive revisions and increased recovery, partially o/ffset by 89 million boe in negative revisions. Many producing fields had positive revisions due to better performance, new drilling targets and improved recovery measures, as well as reduced uncertainty due to further drilling and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduction experience. The positive revisions also included a direct e/ffect of higher commodity prices, increasing the proved reserves by approximately 63 million boe through increased economic lifetime on several fields. The negative revisions were mainly related to unforeseen events and operational challenges resulting in reduced production potential on some fields in addition to reduced entitlement volumes from several fields with PSAs.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nA total of net 278 million boe of new proved reserves were added through extensions and discoveries. Continuous extension of the proved area in the Appalachian basin together with a record number of\n\nsubmitted PDOs in Norway, of which Munin and Halten \u00d8st were the largest, are the main contributors to this category. In addition, this category includes extensions of proved areas through drilling of new wells in previously undrilled areas at other fields in Norway and in Argentina.\n\n## Purchases and sales of reserves-in-place\n\nA total of 36 million boe of new proved reserves in the Statfjord Area, which covers the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and UK continental shelf, were purchased in 2022.\n\nA total of 128 million boe of sales of reserves-in-place are related to the exit of joint arrangements in Russia in\n\naddition to the sale of the Ekofisk Area and a minority share in Martin Linge on the NCS. Equinor has no remaining proved reserves in Russia at year end 2022.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Equinor entered into an agreement to divest our interests in the Corrib field in Ireland. Closing is dependent on governmental approval and is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2023. The sale will result in an estimated reduction in proved reserves of approximately 11 million boe.\n\n## Production\n\nThe 2022 entitlement production was 695 million boe, down from 710 million boe in 2021 due to sales, natural decline and operational challenges.",

The Johan Sverdrup, Sn\u00f8hvit and Oseberg area fields, which have continuous development activities, together with fields not yet in production, such as Johan Castberg and Munin, have the largest proved undeveloped reserves in Norway. The largest assets with proved undeveloped reserves outside Norway, are Bacalhau, Peregrino and Roncador in Brazil, the Appalachian basin, Vito and Caesar-Tonga in the USA, Mariner in the UK, and ACG in Azerbaijan.

        "page_content": "## Operational performance\n\nIn response to the energy crisis, Equinor liaised with partners and Norwegian authorities to boost gas exports to Europe through adjusted production permits, reduced gas injection and augmented energy amount in NGL. A change from gas injection to gas export from some fields contributed to the 8% increase in the natural gas output throughout 2022, underpinned by safe and dependable operations.\n\nEquinor decided to maintain high gas production levels from Troll, Oseberg and Heidrun through the summer and postponed turnarounds at Oseberg from May to September, based on a thorough evaluation of the plants' technical integrity. This contributed to refilling European gas storages before the winter, enhancing European security of supply. Equinor collaborated closely with Norwegian authorities to manage the security situation in 2022 and received support to strengthen physical security both o/ffshore and onshore.\n\nThe 1.7% rise in output from 2021 to 2022 was mainly driven by Martin Linge and Troll phase 3 producing for the full year, Sn\u00f8hvit resuming production in June, and increased gas output from Gina Krog, Troll and partner-operated Skarv. This was partially o/ffset by natural decline. While gas volumes rose by 8%, liquids volumes declined by 6% compared to 2021. For information about the NCS production, see section 5.5 Production per field. Over time, the volumes lifted and sold will equal entitlement production, but may be higher or lower in any period due to di/fferences between the capacities and timing of the vessels lifting the volumes and the actual entitlement production during the period.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nSn\u00f8hvit's satellite Askeladd, Njord's upgraded platform and storage vessel and Johan Sverdrup's fifth platform were brought into production in December, adding volumes and prolonging field life. The Hywind Tampen floating wind farm achieved first power in November, to be fully operational in 2023. Delivering competitive projects, we create long-term value, using standardised and digitised solutions while maintaining a rigorous quality and cost focus. With the pursuit of 'the perfect well,' a modern rig fleet and capitalising on economies of scale, we attain world-class drilling performance.\n\nTo replenish our portfolio with valuable gas volumes for Europe, exploration was conducted near existing infrastructure throughout 2022, resulting in four commercial discoveries. Exploration activity was carried out in 22 wells in 2022, compared to 21 wells in 2021. 19 wells were completed with four commercial discoveries in 2022, compared to 18 wells completed with six commercial discoveries in 2021.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIncreased gas production coupled with high realised gas prices drove the unusually high revenues in 2022. Higher gas transfer price and liquids price increased net operating income and revenues from 2021 to 2022. The increase in revenues was partially o/ffset by the NOK/ USD exchange rate development. Gain on divestment of Ekofisk and a 19% participating interest in Martin Linge increased other income from 2021 to 2022. In 2021, other income was mainly a/ffected by an insurance settlement related to the Melk\u00f8ya fire in 2020.\n\nIncreased maintenance, operational activities, higher environmental taxes and electricity prices led to\n\nincreased operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses from 2021 to 2022. New fields also contributed to the increase, which was partially o/ffset by the NOK/USD exchange rate development.\n\nIncreased proved reserves on several fields and decreased depreciation of the asset retirement\n\n## Performance review\n\n## E&P Norway - condensed income statement under IFRS\n\n|                                                         | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                        | 2022                             | 2021                             | 22-21 change                     |\n| Revenues                                                | 74,774                           | 38,841                           | 93%                              |\n| Other income                                            | 1,155                            | 546                              | >100%                            |\n| Total revenues and other income                         | 75,930                           | 39,386                           | 93%                              |\n| Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses | (3,782)                          | (3,652)                          | 4%                               |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses    | (4,167)                          | (4,900)                          | (15%)                            |\n| Exploration expenses                                    | (366)                            | (363)                            | 1%                               |\n| Net operating income/(loss)                             | 67,614                           | 30,471                           | >100%                            |\n\n|                                                             | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Operational information                                     | 2022                             | 2021                             | 22-21 change                     |\n| E&P Norway entitlement liquid and gas production (mboe/day) | 1,387                            | 1,364                            | 2%                               |\n| Average liquids price (USD/bbl)                             | 97.5                             | 67.6                             | 44%                              |\n| Average internal gas price (USD/mmbtu)                      | 31.22                            | 14.43                            | >100%                            |\n\nobligation (ARO) along with the NOK/USD exchange rate development decreased depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses from 2021 to 2022.

Crude oil is exported to Mongstad through a 283-km designated pipeline, and gas is exported to the gas processing facility at K\u00e5rst\u00f8 through a 156-km pipeline via a subsea connection to the Statpipe pipeline. First oil was achieved in October 2019 and the fifth Johan Sverdrup platform, a processing platform connected to the field centre, was brought on stream on 15 December 2022.\n\nTroll (Equinor 30.58%) in the North Sea is the largest gas field on the NCS and a major oil field. The Troll field regions are connected to the Troll A, B and C platforms. Troll gas is produced mainly at Troll A, and oil mainly at Troll B and C. Fram, Fram H Nord and Byrding are tieins to Troll C.\n\nOver recent years, new compressors have increased the gas processing capacity: one compressor was brought on stream at Troll B in September 2018, and one at Troll C in January 2020. In August 2021, the third phase of the Troll field development was brought on stream, producing from the Troll West gas cap.\n\nA partial electrification of Troll B and a full electrification of Troll C are underway. The Troll A platform, brought on stream in 1996, was the first electrified installation on the NCS.\n\nThe Gullfaks (Equinor 51.00%) oil and gas field in the North Sea is developed with three platforms. Since production started on Gullfaks in 1986, several satellite fields have been developed with subsea wells which are remotely controlled from the Gullfaks A and C platforms. The first power from the Hywind Tampen floating windfarm was supplied to Gullfaks A in November 2022.",

The development includes the Oseberg field centre, Oseberg C, Oseberg East and Oseberg South production platforms. Oil and gas from the satellite fields are transported to the Oseberg field centre for processing and transportation. Oseberg Vestflanken 2 came on stream in October 2018. The wellhead platform was Norway's first unmanned platform, remotely controlled from the Oseberg field centre. To boost recovery and cut emissions, the installation of two new compressors is underway, and a cable to Kollsnes is projected to connect to the onshore grid for a partial electrification.\n\nThe \u00c5sgard (Equinor 34.57%) gas and condensate field in the Norwegian Sea is developed with the \u00c5sgard A FPSO for oil, the \u00c5sgard B semisubmersible floating production platform for gas and condensate, and the \u00c5sgard C storage vessel for oil and condensate. \u00c5sgard C also provides storage for oil produced at Kristin and Tyrihans. In 2015 Equinor started the world's first subsea gas compression train on \u00c5sgard. The Trestakk field is tied back to \u00c5sgard A. The Halten East gas field is being developed in a subsea solution tied back to \u00c5sgard.\n\nThe Martin Linge (Equinor 51.00%) oil and gas field in the North Sea was brought on stream in June 2021. The field is developed with an integrated wellhead, production and accommodation platform and a permanently anchored oil storage vessel. The gas is piped to St Fergus, Scotland, and the oil is shipped in shuttle tankers, after being processed on board the storage vessel. The field is operated from shore. In 2018, the field development started running on power from shore.\n\nENTERPRISE LEVEL PERFORMANCE\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was partially o/ffset by the restart of production at the Peregrino field in Brazil in July 2022 and the start-up of Peregrino phase 2 in October. The lower e/ffect from production sharing agreements (PSA) in 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly caused by lower production from several fields with PSAs, partially o/ffset by e/ffects from increased liquids and gas prices.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nHigher realised liquids and gas prices were the main drivers for the increase in revenues in 2022 compared to 2021. This was partially o/ffset by lower entitlement production. The decrease in net income from equity accounted investments was primarily caused by Equinor's exit from Russia, partially o/ffset by increased income from Argentina.\n\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased mainly due to the restart of production at the Peregrino field. Royalties and production fees increased as result of improved prices and field specific volumes.\n\nDepreciation decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to e/ffects from an impairment in 2021, lower production from declining fields, and portfolio changes. This was partially o/ffset by additional investments, and depreciations for the Peregrino field following the restart of production in 2022.\n\nNet impairments related to property, plant, and equipment decreased from USD 1,587 million in 2021 to USD 286 million in 2022. In 2022, the main contributors were impairments related to Equinor's exit from Russia, partially o/ffset by an impairment reversal of an asset in the Europe and Asia area mainly caused by optimisation of the production profile and higher prices, supported by a slight increase in reserves estimates. In 2021, the main contributors were impairments of assets in the Europe and Asia area caused by reduced reserve estimates.\n\nExpensing of previously capitalised well cost and higher expensed drilling costs were the main drivers for the increase in exploration expenses in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 16,418 million for the year ending 31 December 2022, compared to USD 16,839 million for the year ending 31 December 2021.\n\n## International production\n\nIn production sharing agreements (PSAs) and production sharing contracts (PSCs), entitlement production di/ffers from equity production. Equity production in PSAs and PSCs represent Equinor's percentage ownership in a particular field, whereas entitlement production represents Equinor's share of the volumes distributed to the partners in the field, which is subject to several deductions including but not limited to royalties and the host government's share of profit oil (see section 5.9 Terms and abbreviations).",

Equinor entered the licence in 2020.\n\n## Brazil\n\nPeregrino is a heavy oil field in the o/ffshore Campos basin and is operated by Equinor. The oil is produced from three wellhead platforms with drilling capability, processed on the FPSO Peregrino and o/ffloaded to shuttle tankers.\n\nProduction from Peregrino started in 2011 but was shut down in April 2020 for unplanned maintenance of the subsea equipment. Production was resumed in July 2022 following major maintenance, upgrade and repairs on the FPSO to allow a safe restart.\n\nAs part of the second phase of the field development, the third wellhead platform, Peregrino C, was brought on stream in October 2022, extending the field life. Peregrino C will import gas and lead to fuel switching on the FPSO, ensuring a significant reduction in diesel consumption, which will avoid 100 kilotonnes of CO\u2082 emissions annually.\n\nThe Roncador field is in the o/ffshore Campos basin and is operated by Petrobras. The field has been in production since 1999. The hydrocarbons are produced from two semi-submersibles and two FPSOs. The oil is o/ffloaded to shuttle tankers, and the gas is drained out through pipelines to shore.\n\n## Canada\n\nEquinor has interests in the Jeanne d'Arc basin o/ffshore the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in the partner operated producing oil fields Hebron, Hibernia and Hibernia Southern Extension.\n\n## Africa\n\n## Algeria\n\nIn Salah is an onshore gas field in the central Sahara area which consists of seven fields. The Northern fields have been operating since 2004. The Southern fields have been operating since 2016 and are tied back into the Northern fields' facilities.\n\nIn Amenas is an onshore gas field which contains significant liquid volumes. The infrastructure includes a gas processing plant which is connected to the Sonatrach distribution system. In 2022, two gas turbine generators were reduced to one, optimising power usage and reducing emissions.",

This followed TotalEnergies decision, in February 2022, to not sanction the project and to withdraw from it.\n- \u00b7 On 29 June, Equinor transferred 51% of its interest in the North Platte deep water development project in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 Equinor retained a 49% interest in the project, and Shell will become the new operator of the field. The development was renamed to Sparta to reflect this change.\n- \u00b7 On 16 February 2023, production started on the Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico, capable of producing 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Equinor has a 36.89% interest in the field, which is operated by Shell O/ffshore Inc.\n\nIn 2022, Equinor entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Shell and US Steel to advance a collaborative clean energy hub in the tri-state region of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The hub will focus on decarbonisation opportunities such as carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS), as well as blue hydrogen production and utilisation. In 2022, Equinor also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Battelle, the world's largest independent research and development company, to work together on assessing the tri-state area's carbon storage potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Performance review\n\n## E&P USA - condensed income statement under IFRS\n\n|                                                         | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                        | 2022                             | 2021                             | 22-21 change                     |\n| Revenues                                                | 5,523                            | 4,149                            | 33%                              |\n| Total revenues and other income                         | 5,523                            | 4,149                            | 33%                              |\n| Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses | (938)                            | (1,074)                          | 13%                              |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses    | (361)                            | (1,734)                          | 79%                              |\n| Exploration expenses                                    | (201)                            | (190)                            | (6%)                             |\n| Net operating income/(loss)                             | 4,022                            | 1,150                            | >100%                            |\n\n|                                                      |   For the year ended 31 December |   For the year ended 31 December | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Operational information                              |                          2022    |                          2021    | 22-21 change                     |\n| E&P equity liquids and gas production (mboe/day)     |                           324    |                           373    | (13%)                            |\n| E&P entitlement liquid and gas production (mboe/day) |                           279    |                           321    | (13%)                            |\n| Royalties                                            |                            44    |                            52    | (14%)                            |\n| Average liquids price (USD/bbl)                      |                            81    |                            58.3  | 39%                              |\n| Average internal gas price (USD/mmbtu)               |                             5.55 |                             2.89 | 92%                              |",

We will achieve this by becoming a global o/ffshore wind major and establishing ourselves as a market driven power producer in selected markets by pursuing opportunities in onshore renewables and taking on more merchant risk exposure.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved first power from Hywind Tampen (our first commercial-scale floating wind farm, which delivers renewable power to the Gullfaks and Snorre oil and gas platforms in the North Sea) and St\u0119pie\u0144 (our first Polish solar farm which entered the portfolio as part of the Wento acquisition in 2021). During the year we continued to strengthen our floating wind leadership by winning a ~2GW lease in Morro Bay, California. We also acquired two medium-sized onshore platforms: East Point Energy (a battery storage developer) and BeGreen (a Danish onshore developer).\n\nWe remain value-driven and use di/fferent value drivers from project development and execution, to trading and power market risk management.

The renewable industry is developing\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nfast, costs are increasing, power prices are high, and the supply chain is tightening. We remain disciplined in expensive o/ffshore wind auctions and have accelerated our pace to become more market driven.\n\nEquinor is evolving into an integrated power producer with a diversified power portfolio. As power markets mature, our strategic pillars are merging to become multi-market and multi-technology. We see opportunities will come in the form of broad energy o/fferings, managing merchant risk, growing our o/ffshore wind position, and cementing our floating wind leadership.\n\n## Overview\n\n## O/ffshore wind\n\nWe are developing as a global o/ffshore wind major, powering European homes with renewable electricity from o/ffshore wind farms in the UK and Germany and building material clusters in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the US. In parallel, we are actively positioning ourselves to access emerging markets globally. Equinor sees potential for floating o/ffshore wind projects in Norway, Europe, the US and Asia and is accelerating the development of this technology to strengthen our position in the industry.

The increase was mainly due to the start-up of production from the Gua\u00f1izuil IIA solar plant in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2022, our equity-based installed renewable energy capacity was 0.6 GW. By 2026 Equinor expects to significantly increase installed capacity from renewable projects under development, mainly based on the current project portfolio. Towards 2030, Equinor expects to increase installed renewables capacity further to between 12 and 16 GW and to produce 3560 TWh annually. We are progressing to deliver on the ambitions.\n\nFor 2022, additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments amounted to USD 298 million, while gross capex* from the renewable business amounted to USD 1.3 billion. Equinor's ambition is to have more than 50% of our gross capex* allocated to renewable and low carbon solutions in 2030, and we are on track to deliver on our ambitions.\n\nIn our renewables business, we demonstrated real progress in 2022 on both project execution and on building the portfolio pipeline. In addition to laying the first foundations at the Dogger Bank o/ffshore wind farm in the UK and completion of the St\u0119pie\u0144 solar project in Poland, we put in place further building blocks for our renewables strategy.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nNet operating income was negative USD 84 million in 2022 compared to positive USD 1,245 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to significant gains on divestments in 2021 of around USD 1.4 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Other income was impacted by a gain of USD 87 million related to the divestment of a 10% stake in the Dogger Bank C wind farm project in the UK. In 2021, Other income was impacted by gains of USD 1,386 million related to the sale of a 50% stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets in the U.S.\n\nNet income from equity accounted investments was positively impacted by income from producing assets in both periods, partially o/ffset by losses from projects under development due to the expense of project development costs. The increased net income from equity accounted investments in 2022 was mainly due to a lower portion of project costs being expensed because the Empire Wind project in the US started capitalisation of project costs in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nOperating expenses and selling, general and administration expenses increased due to higher business development costs, driven by higher activity levels in the USA, the UK and Asia.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 1,768 million for the year ending 31 December 2022, compared to USD 1,265 million for the year ending 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Low carbon solutions\n\nThe Low Carbon Solutions (LCS) unit in MMP has responsibility for developing a profitable business based on reforming natural gas to hydrogen with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and to develop carbon management services to o/ffer industries based on CO\u2082 transport and storage. Decarbonising hydrocarbons with CCS is key to reaching net-zero, and Equinor aims to combine its long experience from CCS on the NCS, its reservoir expertise and experience from developing value chains with peers, suppliers and customers to develop large-scale, commercially-viable decarbonisation solutions. By 2030, more than 50% of Equinor's Gross capex* is intended to be dedicated to renewables and low carbon solutions. Below is a list of key CCS and hydrogen projects.\n\n## Key projects\n\nH2BE Equinor, together with ENGIE, is developing the H2BE project in Belgium which aims to produce hydrogen from Norwegian low-carbon natural gas and applying carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project concept will apply technology allowing for decarbonization rates above 95% and will produce hydrogen at large (GW) scale at competitive cost levels. The captured CO\u2082 is planned to be transported by ship or o/ffshore pipeline for permanent and safe storage at a site in the sub-surface of the Norwegian North Sea.\n\nH2H Saltend Equinor is developing a proposed 600 MW hydrogen production plant, due to be operational by 2027 and sited at Saltend Chemicals Park in the UK, where it will help to reduce the park's emissions by up to\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\none third (890,000 tonnes). To achieve this, low carbon hydrogen will directly replace natural gas in several industrial facilities reducing the carbon intensity of their products, as well as being blended into natural gas at the Equinor and SSE Thermal's on-site Triton power station. H2H Saltend is the kick-starter project for the wider Zero Carbon Humber scheme which aims to make the Humber, currently the UK's most carbon intensive industrial region, net-zero by 2040.\n\nNorthern Lights Equinor is, together with Shell and TotalEnergies, developing infrastructure for transport and storage on the NCS of CO\u2082 from various onshore industries. The approved development will have an initial storage capacity of around 1.5 million tonnes of CO\u2082 per year, scalable to around 5 million tonnes of CO\u2082 per year. The Northern Lights infrastructure will enable transport of CO\u2082 from industrial capture sites to a terminal in \u00d8ygarden for intermediate storage before transport by pipeline for permanent storage in a reservoir 2,600 metres under the seabed. In August 2022, Northern Lights and Yara signed the world's first commercial agreement on cross border CO\u2082 transport and storage. As part of the agreement, Northern Lights will transport and store CO\u2082 captured from Yara Sluiskil, an ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. The project is part of Longship, the Norwegian authorities' project for full-scale carbon capture, transport and storage in Norway, and is expected to come on stream in 2024.\n\nSmeaheia Equinor was awarded by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) the operatorship for the development of the CO\u2082 storage Smeaheia in the North Sea. Here, Equinor plans to develop enough the CO\u2082 storage capacity for 20 million\n\ntonnes of CO\u2082 annually, which entails a sharp increase in the capacity to store CO\u2082 on the NCS. Smeaheia is expected to play an important role in enabling CO\u2082 solutions on a commercial basis to industrial customers, such as steel, cement and other heavy industries. Equinor also has ambitions to develop further storage licences in the North Sea in the coming years with the aim of building a common, pipeline-based infrastructure that can contribute to substantial cost reductions for the CCS value chains.\n\n## Performance review\n\n## Operational performance\n\nGas and Oil Sales. The total natural gas sales volumes were 63 bcm in 2022, increased by 2 bcm compared to total volumes for 2021. NCS equity gas volumes increased due to the recovery of Hammerfest LNG and due to e/fforts between EPN, MMP and authorities to increase gas export to Europe. This was achieved by increased production permits, reduced gas injection and optimization of NGL to increase gas calorific value. This was o/ffset by a decrease in international equity gas.\n\nThe average crude, condensate and NGL sales were 2.0 mmbbl per day in 2022, slighty lower than 2021 mainly due to decrease in volumes from NCS, partially o/ffset by increase in sales of international equity volumes.\n\nHigh regularity at onshore gas processing plants and transport systems ensured gas delivery reliability and portfolio flexibility allowed MMP to transport and sell natural gas and oil where it was most needed increasing value creation.\n\n## Natural gas sales (ex.

European gas prices were significantly higher compared to 2021, mainly due to high demand and tight supply and caused by reduced gas imports from Russia.\n\nIn 2022, the average invoiced natural gas sales price in North America was USD 5.89 mmBtu, up 83% from USD 3.22 mmBtu in 2021. North American gas price increase was driven by low production growth, low storage levels and strong demand mainly from power generation.\n\nAll of Equinor's gas produced on the NCS is sold by MMP and purchased from E&P Norway at the fields' lifting point at a market-based internal price with deduction for the cost of bringing the gas from the field to the market and a marketing fee element. Our NCS transfer price for gas was USD 31.22 per mmBtu in 2022, an increase of 116% compared to USD 14.43 per mmBtu in 2021.\n\nThroughput for Mongstad & Tjeldbergodden was lower in 2022 compared to 2021 mainly due to higher planned and unplanned shutdowns. MMP's refining margins were higher for Mongstad in 2022 compared to 2021.

The increase was partially o/ffset by a negative change in derivatives used to manage risk related to bilateral gas sales contracts and from methanol production from natural gas.\n\nNet operating income was positively impacted by an impairment reversal related to a refining asset and adjustments for unrealized market value of gas storages. This was o/ffset by provisions, mainly for onerous contracts.\n\nTotal revenues and other income were USD 148,105 million in 2022, compared to USD 87,393 million in 2021, an increase of 69%.\n\nThe increase in revenues from 2022 to 2021 was mainly due to significant higher gas and oil sales prices in both Europe and North America, and higher gas volumes. This was partially o/ffset by the negative e/ffect of bilateral derivatives related to gas sales agreements and slightly lower liquid sales.\n\nPurchases [net of inventory] were USD 139,916 million in 2022, compared to USD 80,873 million in 2021. The increase from 2021 to 2022 was mainly due to higher prices for both gas and liquids,\n\n## MMP - condensed income statement under IFRS\n\n|                                                         | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                        | 2022                             | 2021                             | Change                           |\n| Revenues                                                | 147,691                          | 87,204                           | 69%                              |\n| Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments     | 406                              | 22                               | >100%                            |\n| Other income                                            | 9                                | 168                              | (95%)                            |\n| Total revenues and other income                         | 148,105                          | 87,393                           | 69%                              |\n| Purchases [net of inventory]                            | (139,916)                        | (80,873)                         | 73%                              |\n| Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses | (4,591)                          | (3,753)                          | 22%                              |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses    | 14                               | (1,604)                          | N/A                              |\n| Net operating income/(loss)                             | 3,612                            | 1,163                            | >100%                            |\n\n|                                                       | For the year ended 31 December   |   For the year ended 31 December | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Operational information                               | 2022                             |                          2021    | Change                           |\n| Liquid sales volume (mmbbl)                           | 740.1                            |                           758.4  | (2%)                             |\n| Natural gas sales Equinor (bcm)                       | 63.3                             |                            61    | 4%                               |\n| Natural gas entitlement sales Equinor (bcm)           | 56.1                             |                            54    | 4%                               |\n| Power generation (GWh) Equinor share                  | 1,012                            |                             0    | N/A                              |\n| Average invoice gas price - Europe (USD/MMBtu)        | 33.44                            |                            14.6  | >100%                            |\n| Average invoice gas price - North America (USD/MMBtu) | 5.89                             |                             3.22 | 83%                              |",

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased mainly due to increased activity within Low Carbon Solutions and trading.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment were positive USD 14 million in 2022, compared to negative USD 1,604 million in 2021. The decrease in depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses from 2021 to 2022 was mainly caused by the impairment of refinery assets in 2021 and reversal in 2022.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 5,307 million for the year ending 31 December 2022, compared to USD 4,119 million for the year ending 31 December 2021.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nREPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->",

TDI is accountable for safe and e/fficient development and operation of their assets; and for providing expertise, projects and products across the company.\n\n## Corporate sta/ff and support functions\n\nCorporate sta/ff and support functions comprise the non-operating activities supporting Equinor, and include head o/ffice and central functions that provide business support such as finance and control, corporate communication, safety, security and sustainability, corporate audit, legal and compliance and people and organisation.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP)\n\nProjects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP) is responsible for oil and gas field development and well delivery, development of wind power, CCS and hydrogen projects, and procurement in Equinor. PDP aims to deliver safe, secure and e/fficient project development, including well construction, founded on world-class project execution and technology excellence. PDP utilises innovative technologies, digital solutions and carbon-e/fficient concepts to shape a competitive project portfolio at the forefront of the energy industry transformation. Sustainable value is being created together with suppliers through a simplified and standardised fit-for-purpose approach.\n\nProject developmen t is responsible for planning, developing and executing major oil and gas field development, brownfield and field decommissioning projects, and development and execution of wind power, CCS and hydrogen projects, where Equinor is the operator.\n\nDrilling and well is responsible for designing wells and delivering drilling and well operations onshore and o/ffshore globally (except for US onshore).\n\nProcurement and supplier relations is responsible for our global procurement activities and the management of supplier relations with our extensive portfolio of suppliers.\n\n## Performance review\n\nIn 2022 the Other reporting segment recorded a net operating loss of USD 178 million compared to a net operation loss of USD 234 million in 2021. The improvement was mainly due to reduced insurance costs during the year relating to the fire at Melk\u00f8ya LNG in 2020.\n\nSince the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases in 2019, all leases were presented within the Other segment and lease costs have been allocated to the operating segments based on underlying lease payments with a corresponding credit in the Other segment. With e/ffect from 2022, lease contracts are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 in all segments. This change does not a/ffect Equinor's consolidated financial statements. Comparative numbers in the segments have been restated.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 1,096 million for the year ending 31 December 2022, compared to USD 1,077 million for the year ending 31 December 2021.\n\nDigital twin in use in operations of the Mariner field, North Sea, UK.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Organisation\n\nThe Equinor Group (Equinor) consists of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries. Equinor ASA is incorporated and domiciled in Norway and listed on the Oslo B\u00f8rs (Norway) and the New York Stock Exchange (USA). The address of its registered o/ffice is Forusbeen 50, N-4035 Stavanger, Norway.\n\nEquinor's objective is to develop, produce and market various forms of energy and derived products and services, as well as other business. The activities may also be carried out through participation in or cooperation with other companies. Equinor Energy AS, a 100% owned operating subsidiary of Equinor ASA and owner of all of Equinor's oil and gas activities and net assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, is co-obligor or guarantor for certain debt obligations of Equinor ASA.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor for the full year 2022 were approved for issuance by the board of directors on 14 March 2023 and is subject to approval by the annual general meeting on 10 May 2023.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 2. Accounting policies\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries (Equinor) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), interpretations issued by IASB and the additional requirements of the Norwegian Accounting Act, e/ffective on 31 December 2022.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with some exceptions where fair value measurement is applied. These exceptions are specifically disclosed in the accounting policies sections in relevant notes. The material accounting policies described in these Consolidated financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented, except as otherwise noted in the disclosure related to the impact of policy changes following the adoption of new accounting standards and voluntary changes in 2022.\n\nCertain amounts in the comparable years have been restated or reclassified to conform to current year presentation. All amounts in the Consolidated financial statements are denominated in USD millions, unless otherwise specified. The subtotals and totals in some of the tables in the notes may not equal the sum of the amounts shown in the primary financial statements due to rounding.\n\nOperational expenses in the Consolidated statement of income are presented as a combination of function and nature in conformity with industry practice. Purchases [net of inventory variation] and Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses are presented on separate lines based on their nature, while Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses as well as Exploration expenses are presented on a functional basis. Significant expenses such as salaries, pensions, etc. are presented by their nature in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries as well as Equinor's interests in jointly controlled and equity accounted investments. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from Equinor's internal transactions, have been eliminated.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include all entities controlled by Equinor ASA. Entities are determined to be controlled by Equinor when Equinor has power over the entity, ability to use that power to a/ffect the entity's returns, and exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the date control is achieved until the date control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities in Equinor, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange di/fferences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as foreign exchange gains or losses within Net financial items. However, foreign exchange di/fferences arising from the translation of estimate-based provisions are generally accounted for as part of the change in the underlying estimate and included within the relevant operating expense or income tax line-items depending on the nature of the provision. Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions.\n\nWhen preparing the Consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with functional currencies other than the Group's presentation currency USD are translated into USD at the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of such entities are translated using the foreign exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange di/fferences",

These estimates and assumptions form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities when these are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed\n\non an on-going basis considering the current and expected future set of conditions.\n\nEquinor is exposed to several underlying economic factors a/ffecting the overall results, such as commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, market risk premiums and interest rates as well as financial instruments with fair values derived from changes in these factors. The e/ffects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to several of these economic assumptions. In addition, Equinor's results are influenced by the level of production, which in the short term may be influenced by, for instance, maintenance programmes. In the long-term, the results are impacted by the success of exploration, field developments and operating activities.\n\nThe most important matters in understanding the key sources of estimation uncertainty are described in each of the following notes:\n\n- 3 - Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes\n- 11 - Income taxes\n- 12 - Property, plant and equipment\n- 13 - Intangible assets\n- 14 - Impairments\n- 23 - Provisions and other liabilities\n- 26 - Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Changes in accounting policies in the current period Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statement 2: Replacing Significant accounting policies with Material accounting policies\n\nIASB has issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements. These amendments are intended to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures and provide additional guidance and illustrative examples. The amendments are e/ffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Earlier application is permitted, and Equinor has applied the amendments with e/ffect from these Consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policy information should be considered material if its disclosure can reasonably be expected to influence user decisions and therefore is needed to understand other information provided about material transactions, other events, or conditions in the financial statements. IASB has acknowledged that standardised information, or information that only duplicates or summarises the requirements of the IFRS -standards, is generally less useful than entity-specific accounting policy information. Even though such information could be material in specific circumstances, Equinor has focused the accounting policy disclosures on Equinorspecific policy choices, disclosing only those accounting policies that are considered necessary to understand other material information in the Consolidated financial statements of Equinor.",

Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes\n\n## Accounting policies - cost of CO\u2082 quotas\n\nPurchased CO\u2082 quotas under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) are reflected at cost in Operating expenses as incurred in line with emissions. Accruals for CO\u2082 quotas required to cover emissions to date are valued at market price and reflected as a current liability within Trade, other payables and provisions. Quotas owned, but exceeding the emissions incurred to date, are carried in the balance sheet at cost price, classified as Other current receivables, as long as such purchased quotas are acquired in order to cover own emissions and may be kept to cover subsequent years' emissions. Quotas purchased and held for trading purposes are carried in the balance sheet at fair value, and the changes in fair value are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income on the line-item Other income.\n\nObligations resulting from current year emissions and the corresponding amounts for quotas that have been bought, paid and expensed, but which have not yet been surrendered to the relevant authorities, are reflected net in the balance sheet.\n\n## Equinor's strategy and ambitions\n\nEquinor's ambition is to continue supplying society with energy with lower emissions over time, to be a leading company in the energy transition and becoming a net-zero company by 2050, including emissions from\n\nproduction through to final energy consumption. Equinor's strategy is to create value as a leader in the energy transition by pursuing high-value growth in renewables and new market opportunities in low carbon solutions at the same time as we optimise our oil and gas portfolio. This strategy covers three strategically important and interconnected areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas. Equinor's main focus is optimising our resources, cutting emissions in our operations and identifying new procedures that enable us to continue supplying energy that the world needs with a low footprint.\n- \u00b7 Renewables. There is an apparent global demand for more renewable energy, and Equinor's investments in o/ffshore wind and solar are growing exponentially to meet this demand.\n- \u00b7 Low carbon solutions. Equinor will continue its investments in new technologies and value chains for producing lower emissions by replacing the use of carbon when generating new energy or capturing and removing the greenhouse gases before they reach the atmosphere. Even though carbon capture and storage (CCS) has existed as a technology for many decades, it takes time to develop the value chains and carbon capture and storage has yet to be implemented as a revenue-generating service to the market on a full scale.\n\n## Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, market and technology developments related to the issue of climate change, can a/ffect our business plans and financial\n\nperformance. Shifts in stakeholder focus between energy security, a/ffordability and sustainability add uncertainty to delivery and outcomes associated with Equinor's strategy. Equinor's long-term plans have to consider how the global energy markets may develop in the long term. Potential scenarios of future changes in demand for our products (oil, gas and power in key markets) are analysed, including World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) scenarios that illustrate the wide range of possible demand for di/fferent energy sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables. Commodity price sensitivities are presented in a table below and in note 14 Impairments.\n\nEquinor assesses climate risk from two perspectives: transition risk, which relates to the financial robustness of the company's business model and portfolio in various decarbonisation scenarios; and physical climate risk, which relates to the exposure of our assets to climate-related perils in di/fferent warming scenarios. Equinor's climate roadmap and all of our climaterelated ambitions are a response to these challenges and risks related to climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 Stricter climate laws, regulations and policies as well as adverse litigation outcomes could adversely impact Equinor's financial results and outlook, including the value of its assets. This might be directly through regulatory changes towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels, changes in taxation, increased costs, access to opportunities, or indirectly through changes in consumer behaviour or technology developments.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Changing demand for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, and innovation and technology changes supporting their costcompetitive development, represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor. We assess and manage climate-related risks related to technology development and implementation across our portfolio, as well as recognising risks related to competing or emerging technologies elsewhere. Examples of relevant technologies within our portfolio include carbon capture and storage (CCS), blue/green hydrogen, battery technology, solar and wind renewable energy, nuclear fusion, low CO\u2082 intensity solutions, improvements in methane emissions and application of renewables in oil and gas production.\n- \u00b7 Market development and our ability to reduce costs and capitalize on technology improvements are important but unpredictable risk factors. Multiple factors in the energy transition contribute to uncertainty in future energy price assumptions, and changes in investor and societal sentiment can a/ffect our access to capital markets, attractiveness for investors, and potentially restrict access to finance or increase financing costs.\n- \u00b7 Strong competition for assets, changing levels of policy support, and di/fferent commercial/contractual models may lead to diminishing returns within the renewable and low carbon industries and hinder Equinor ambitions. These investments may be exposed to interest rate risk and inflation risk.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in physical climate parameters could impact Equinor through increased costs or incidents a/ffecting Equinor's operations. Examples of acute physical parameters that could impact Equinor's facility design and operations include increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as extreme windspeeds, wave-heights or flooding. Examples of chronic physical climate parameters include limitations in freshwater availability, a pattern with generally increased wind speeds and as most of Equinor's physical assets are located o/ffshore, a key potential chronic physical climate impact is expected to be rising sea level accompanied with increased wave heights. As we continue to build our renewable portfolio, unexpected changes in meteorological parameters, such as average wind speed or changes in wind patterns and cloud cover that a/ffect renewable energy production will also be important factors to consider. Physical risk factors are mitigated through technical and engineering functions in design, operations and maintenance, with due consideration of how the external physical environment may be changing. However, there is uncertainty regarding the magnitude of impact and time horizon for the occurrence of physical impacts of climate change, which leads to uncertainty regarding the potential impact for Equinor.\n\n## Impact on Equinor's financial statements\n\n## CO\u2082-cost and EU ETS carbon credits\n\nOur oil & gas operations in Europe are part of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Equinor buys EU ETS allowances (quotas or carbon credits) for the emissions related to our oil & gas production and processing. Currently we receive a share of free quotas according to the EU ETS regulation. The share of free quotas is expected to be significantly reduced in the future.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nTotal expensed CO\u2082 cost related to emissions and purchase of CO\u2082 quotas in Equinor related to activities resulting in GHG emissions (Equinor's share of the operating licences in addition to our land-based facilities) amounts to USD 510 million in 2022, USD 428 million in 2021, and USD 268 million in 2020. A large portion of the cost of CO\u2082 in Equinor is related to the purchase of EU ETS quotas. The table below shows an analysis of number of quotas utilised by Equinor's operated licences and land-based facilities subject to the requirements under EU ETS:\n\n| Number of EU ETS quotas                    | 2022        | 2021         |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance at 1 January               | 11,026,286  | 11,027,242   |\n| Allocated free quotas                      | 3,697,089   | 3,560,286    |\n| Purchased quotas on the ETS market         | 5,985,000   | 7,605,265    |\n| Sold quotas on the ETS market              | 0           | (135,177)    |\n| Settled quotas (o/ffset against emissions) | (9,925,999) | (11,031,330) |\n| Closing balance at 31 December             | 10,782,376  | 11,026,286   |",

        "page_content": "## Investments in renewables\n\nThe energy transition creates many new business opportunities, primarily related to further development of Equinor's renewables business and within CCS. Driven by the energy transition and an increasing demand for electricity from renewable energy sources, Equinor continues to build its renewable business. We focus on o/ffshore wind and also explore opportunities within onshore renewables and integrated power market solutions. At present, Equinor's renewable portfolio spans multiple continents and technologies- onshore and o/ffshore - and di/fferent ownership structures:\n\n- \u00b7 In operation: Mainly o/ffshore wind in UK and Germany and solar farms in Brazil and Argentina\n- \u00b7 In construction: The most significant projects are the Dogger Bank projects in UK (SSE operated) and Hywind Tampen in Norway in addition to construction of solar plants in Poland\n- \u00b7 Additional capacity has secured o/fftake, mainly o/ffshore wind projects in the US and Poland\n- \u00b7 Accessed pipeline capacity (currently without o/fftake). This includes o/ffshore wind in the US and South Korea and solar and onshore wind projects in Brazil and Poland\n- \u00b7 Equinor also holds a 13.1% shareholding in Scatec ASA, a leading renewable power producer, delivering a/ffordable and clean energy worldwide\n\nEquinor's investments in renewables and low carbon solutions projects are included as Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments in the REN-segment in note 5 Segments and amounts to USD 298 million in 2022 and USD 457 million in 2021. Equinor's ambition is to become a global o/ffshore wind major and an industry leader in floating o/ffshore wind, drawing on our extensive o/ffshore experience to drive\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthe industry forward. In addition, Equinor explores opportunities within onshore renewables.\n\n## Investments in CCS\n\nThrough our activities within CCS, we are building capabilities and a competitive position for future business opportunities and a new revenue stream related to disposal of CO\u2082 from customers such as from waste incineration and cement production and would also be basis for solutions for decarbonised hydrogen as an energy carrier which would also be a flexible solution to backup intermittent renewables in Europe. Equinor is making significant steps to industrialise CCS and we are already involved in the Northern Lights project in Norway providing CO\u2082 transport and storage solutions (in partnership with Shell and TotalEnergies). It represents the start of commercial CCS in Europe and is on track to demonstrate that CCS is a valid decarbonisation solution for important industry sectors. Equinor has during 2022 contributed with USD 36 million to the company as capital increases (USD 21 million in 2021).\n\nResearch and development activities (R&D) In addition to the beforementioned significant financial e/ffects, Equinor is also involved in several activities within R&D. Several of these activities are related to optimising our oil and gas activities and cutting emissions from our activities as well as developing new business opportunities within renewables or low carbon solutions. Financial e/ffects from Equinor's total R&D activities can be located in note 9 Auditor's remuneration and Research and development expenditures (expensed R&D) and in note 12 Property, Plant & Equipment (capitalised R&D).\n\n## E/ffects on estimation uncertainty\n\nThe e/ffects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to some of the economic assumptions in our estimations of future cash flows. The results of the development of such initiatives, and the degree to which Equinor's operations will be a/ffected by them, are sources of uncertainty. Estimating global energy demand and commodity prices towards 2050 is a challenging task, as this comprises assessing the future development in supply and demand, technology change, taxation, tax on emissions, production limits and other important factors. The assumptions may change over time, which could materialise in di/fferent outcomes from the current projected scenarios. This could result in significant changes to accounting estimates, such as economic useful life (a/ffects depreciation period and timing of asset retirement obligations), value-in-use calculations (a/ffects impairment assessments) and measurement of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nEquinor's commodity price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing, are set in accordance with requirements in IFRS and based on management's best estimate of the development of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances. This price-set is currently not equal to a price-set required to achieve the goals in the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario, nor a price-set in accordance with the Announced Pledges Scenario as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). A future change in the trajectory of how the world acts with regards to implementing actions in accordance with the goals in the Paris agreement could, depending on the detailed characteristics of such a trajectory,\n\nhave a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's property, plant and equipment in total. A calculation of a possible e/ffect of using the assumed commodity prices and CO\u2082 prices in a 1.5\u00baC compatible NZE by 2050 Scenario as estimated by IEA could result in an impairment of upstream production assets and intangible assets around USD 4 billion before tax, see the sensitivity table below.\n\nSimilarly, we have calculated the possible e/ffect of using prices according to the Announced Pledges Scenario, a scenario which is based on all of the climate-related commitments announced by governments around the Globe. Using this scenario, the world is expected to reach a 1.8\u00baC increase in the year 2100, and this could result in an impairment of less than USD 0.5 billion before tax using the same simplified model, see the sensitivity table below.\n\nThese illustrative impairment sensitivity calculations are based on a simplified model and limitations described in note 14 Impairments. However, when preparing these illustrative scenario sensitivities, we have linearly interpolated between current prices and the price set disclosed in the table below for both the NZE by 2050 scenario and the Announced pledges scenario. Applying this simplified approach, the illustrative potential impairments are significantly lower than the amount disclosed in note 14 Impairments where an immediate 30% reduction in commodity prices has been applied, also considering a somewhat declining production profile, concentrated before the year 2030 for our producing and sanctioned development projects and the e/ffects of discounting.",

        "page_content": "## Cost of CO 2\n\nThe EU ETS price has increased significantly from 25 EUR/tonne in 2020. The average cost of EU ETS allowances was 81 EUR/tonne in 2022 (54 EUR/tonne in 2021). The price is expected to remain high, in the region of 80 EUR/tonne for the next couple of years. Then the price is expected to be 105 EUR/tonne in 2040 and thereafter increasing to 130 EUR/tonne in 2050. As such, Equinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today, and a global tax on CO\u2082 emissions will have a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's oil and gas assets. Currently, Equinor pays CO\u2082 fees in Norway, the UK, Germany and Nigeria. Norway's Climate Action Plan for the period 2021-2030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO\u2082 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO\u2082 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/ tonne in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nEquinor's response to this risk is evaluation of carbon intensity on both project and portfolio level in our investment and divestment decisions. We have also introduced an internal carbon price, currently set at 58 USD/tonne and increasing towards 100 USD/ tonne by the year 2030 and staying flat thereafter (in countries with higher carbon costs, we use the country specific cost expectations), to be used in our investment decisions. This cost-scenario is uncertain, but this extra cost serves as a placeholder for possible future CO\u2082 pricing systems, making sure our assets are financially robust in such a scenario. As such, climate considerations are a part of the investment decisions\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nfollowing Equinor's strategy and commitments to the energy transition.\n\nClimate considerations are also included in the impairment calculations directly by estimating the CO\u2082 taxes in the cash flows. Indirectly, the expected e/ffect of climate change is included in the estimated commodity prices where supply and demand are considered. The CO\u2082 prices also have e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-o/ff of the projects. Impairment calculations are based on best estimate assumptions. To reflect that carbon will have a cost for all our assets, the current best estimate is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates.\n\n## Sensitivity table\n\nIn this table, we have presented some relevant prices and variables and the anticipated future development compared to our managements' best estimate and an illustrative potential impairment e/ffect given these scenarios. The scenario price-sets have been retrieved from IEA's report, World Energy Outlook 2022. Prices are adjusted for inflation and presented in Real 2022.

Equinor uses scenario analysis to outline di/fferent possible energy futures and several of these imply lower oil and natural gas prices. If they decrease, the oil and gas revenues will also decrease, and potentially reduce the economic lifetime of some assets. Equinor seeks to mitigate this risk by focusing on improving the resilience of the existing upstream portfolio, maximising the e/fficiency of our infrastructure on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and optimising our high-quality international portfolio. Equinor will continue\n\nto add high value barrels to the portfolio through exploration and increased recovery, and NCS cash flow and value creation are expected to remain high also beyond 2030. The NCS project portfolio is very robust against potential low oil and gas prices and actions are in place to both maintain cost discipline across the company and ensure robustness of the non-sanctioned oil and natural gas projects.\n\nEquinor will also continue to selectively explore for new resources with a focus on mature areas with existing infrastructure to minimise emissions and maximise value.

Reaching our 50 percent reduction ambition for operated scope 1 and 2 emissions will require a focused and coordinated e/ffort across the company on executing and maturing abatement projects, improving energy e/fficiency of o/ffshore and onshore assets, developing new technologies, and strengthening resilience in the portfolio. The abatement projects primarily include electrification of o/ffshore assets in Norway, mainly by power from shore but also including innovations such as Hywind Tampen, our floating wind farm powering o/ffshore oil and gas platforms. In combination with our focus on renewables and CCS, these abatement projects are expected to reduce Equinor's emissions su/fficiently to support our mid-term ambitions. As such, Equinor's plans to become a net-zero company by 2050 have currently not resulted in the identification of additional assets being triggered for impairment or earlier cessation.\n\nAny future exploration may be restricted by regulations, market and strategic considerations. Provided that the economic assumptions would deteriorate to such an extent that undeveloped assets controlled by Equinor\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nshould not materialize, assets at risk mainly comprise the intangible assets Oil and Gas prospects, signature bonuses and the capitalised exploration costs, with a total carrying value of USD 3,634 million. See note 13 Intangible assets for more information regarding Equinor's intangible assets.\n\n## Timing of Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)\n\nAs mentioned above, there are currently no assets triggered for earlier cessation as a result of Equinor's plans to become a net-zero company by 2050. But, if the business cases of Equinor's oil and gas producing assets in the future should change materially due to governmental initiatives to limit climate change, this could a/ffect the timing of cessation of our assets and also our asset retirement obligations. A shorter production period, accelerating the time for when assets need to be removed after ended production, will increase the carrying value of the liability. To illustrate the potential financial e/ffect of earlier removal, we have estimated the e/ffect of performing removal five years earlier than currently scheduled to an increase in the liability of around USD 1 billion. See note 23 Provisions and other liabilities for more information regarding Equinor's ARO\n\n## Note 4. Financial risk and capital management\n\n## General information and financial risks\n\nEquinor's business activities naturally expose Equinor to financial risks such as market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Equinor's approach to risk management includes assessing and managing risk in activities using a holistic risk approach, by considering relevant correlations at portfolio level between the most important market risks and the natural hedges inherent in Equinor's portfolio. This approach allows Equinor to reduce the number of risk management transactions and avoid sub-optimisation.\n\nThe corporate risk committee, which is headed by the chief financial o/fficer, is responsible for Equinor's Enterprise Risk Management and for proposing appropriate measures to adjust risk at the corporate level. This includes assessing Equinor's financial risk policies.\n\n## Market risk\n\nEquinor operates in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity markets and is exposed to market risks including fluctuations in hydrocarbon prices, foreign currency rates, interest rates, and electricity prices that can a/ffect the revenues and costs of operating, investing, and financing. These risks are managed primarily on a short-term basis with a focus on achieving the highest risk-adjusted returns for Equinor within the given mandate. Longterm exposures are managed at the corporate level, while short-term exposures are managed according\n\nto trading strategies and mandates. Mandates in the trading organisations within crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity are relatively restricted compared to the total market risk of Equinor.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nEquinor's most important long-term commodity risk (crude oil and natural gas) is related to future market prices as Equinor's risk policy is to be exposed to both upside and downside price movements. In the longer term, also power price risk is to a large extent expected to contribute to Equinor's commodity price risk portfolio. To manage short-term commodity risk, Equinor enters into commodity-based derivative contracts, including futures, options, over-the-counter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for di/fferences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, power and emissions. Equinor's bilateral gas sales portfolio is exposed to various price indices with a combination of gas price markers.\n\nThe term of crude oil and refined oil products derivatives are usually less than one year, and they are traded mainly on the Inter- Continental Exchange (ICE) in London, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the OTC Brent market, and crude and refined products swap markets. The term of natural gas, power, and emission derivatives is usually three years or less, and they are mainly OTC physical forwards and options, NASDAQ OMX Oslo forwards, and futures traded on the European Energy Exchange (EEX), NYMEX and ICE.",

Equinor manages its interest rates exposure on its bond portfolio based on risk and reward considerations from an enterprise risk management perspective. This means that the fixed/floating mix on interest rate exposure may vary from time to time. For more detailed information about Equinor's long-term debt portfolio see note 21 Finance debt.\n\nThe following interest rate risk sensitivity has been calculated by assuming a change of 1.2 percentage points as a reasonable possible change in interest rates at the end of 2022. In 2021, a change of 0.8 percentage points in interest rates was viewed as a reasonable possible change.

In addition, Equinor holds some other listed and non-listed equities mainly for long-term strategic purposes. By holding these assets, Equinor is exposed to equity price risk, defined as the risk of declining equity prices, which can result in a decline in the carrying value of certain Equinor's assets recognised in the balance sheet. The equity price risk in the portfolio held by Equinor's captive insurance company is managed, with the aim of maintaining a moderate risk profile, through\n\ngeographical diversification and the use of broad benchmark indexes.\n\nThe following equity price risk sensitivity has been calculated, by assuming a 35% reasonable possible change in equity prices that impact Equinor's financial accounts, based on balances at 31 December 2022. At 31 December 2021, a change of 35% in equity prices was equally viewed as a reasonable possible change. The estimated gains and the estimated losses following from a change in equity prices would impact the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n| Equity price sensitivity   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                            | 2022             | 2022             | 2021             | 2021             |\n| (in USD million)           | - 35%            | + 35%            | - 35%            | + 35%            |\n| Net gains/(losses)         | (450)            | 450              | (534)            | 534              |\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Equinor will not be able to meet obligations of financial liabilities when they become due. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that Equinor always has su/fficient funds available to cover its financial obligations.\n\nThe main cash outflows include the quarterly dividend payments and Norwegian petroleum tax payments made six times per year. Trading in collateralised commodities and financial contracts also exposes Equinor to liquidity risk related to potential collateral calls from counterparties.\n\nIf the cash flow forecasts indicate that the liquid assets will fall below target levels, new long-term funding will be considered. Equinor raises debt in all major capital markets (USA, Europe and Asia) for long-term funding purposes. The policy is to have a maturity profile with repayments not exceeding 5% of capital employed in any year for the nearest five years. Equinor's noncurrent financial liabilities have a weighted average maturity of approximately nine years.

Equinor's primary focus is on maintaining its credit rating in the A category on a stand alone basis (excluding uplifts for Norwegian Government ownership). Equinor's current long-term ratings are AA- with a stable outlook (including one notch uplift) and Aa2 with a stable outlook (including two notch uplift) from S&P and Moody's, respectively. In order to monitor financial robustness, a key ratio utilised by Equinor is the nonGAAP metric of 'Net interest-bearing debt adjusted (ND) to Capital employed adjusted* (CE)'.\n\nND1 is defined as Equinor's interest-bearing financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments, adjusted for collateral deposits and balances held by Equinor's captive insurance company (amounting to USD 6,538 million and USD 2,369 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively). CE1 is defined as Equinor's total equity (including noncontrolling interests) and ND1. ND2 is defined as ND1 adjusted for lease liabilities (amounting to USD 3,668 million and USD 3,562 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively). CE2 is defined as Equinor's total equity (including non-controlling interests) and ND2.\n\n|                                                                               | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                                              | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Net interest-bearing debt adjusted, including lease liabilities (ND1)         | (6,750)          | 3,236            |\n| Net interest-bearing debt adjusted (ND2)                                      | (10,417)         | (326)            |\n| Capital employed adjusted, including lease liabilities (CE1)                  | 47,239           | 42,259           |\n| Capital employed adjusted (CE2)                                               | 43,571           | 38,697           |\n| Net debt to capital employed adjusted*, including lease liabilities (ND1/CE1) | (14.3%)          | 7.7%             |\n| Net debt to capital employed adjusted* (ND2/CE2)                              | (23.9%)          | (0.8%)           |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 5. Segments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquinor's operations are managed through operating segments identified on the basis of those components of Equinor that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Equinor's corporate executive committee (CEC). The reportable segments Exploration & Production Norway (E&P Norway), Exploration & Production International (E&P International), Exploration & Production USA (E&P USA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) and Renewables (REN) correspond to the operating segments. The operating segments Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP), Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI) and Corporate sta/ff and functions are aggregated into the reportable segment Other based on materiality. The majority of the costs in PDP and TDI is allocated to the three Exploration & Production segments, MMP and REN.\n\nThe accounting policies of the reporting segments equal those described in these Consolidated financial statements, except for the line-item Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments in which movements related to changes in asset retirement obligations are excluded as well\n\nThe Exploration & Production operating segments are responsible for the discovery and appraisal of new resources, commercial development and safe and e/fficient operation of the oil and gas portfolios within their respective geographical areas: E&P Norway on the Norwegian continental shelf, E&P USA in USA and\n\nas provisions for onerous contracts which reflect only obligations towards group external parties. The measurement basis of segment profit is net operating income/(loss). Deferred tax assets, pension assets, non-current financial assets, total current assets and total liabilities are not allocated to the segments. Transactions between the segments, mainly from the sale of crude oil, gas, and related products, are performed at defined internal prices which have been derived from market prices. The transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nWith e/ffect from 2022, Equinor changed the measurement basis for the segments related to leases. Up to and including 2021, all leases were presented within the Other segment and lease costs were allocated to the operating segments based on underlying lease payments with a corresponding credit in the Other segment. With e/ffect from 2022, lease contracts are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases in all segments. This change does not a/ffect Equinor's Consolidated financial statements except the segment disclosures in this note. Comparative numbers in the segments have been restated.\n\nE&P International worldwide outside of E&P Norway and E&P USA.\n\nPDP is responsible for global project development, well deliveries, and sourcing across Equinor.",

The decrease has mainly a/ffected Property, plant and equipment, see note 12.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 6. Acquisitions and disposals\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations, except for transactions between entities under common control, are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price includes total consideration paid to acquire the entity's assets and liabilities, as well as contingent consideration at fair value. The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed under Selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income under Other income.\n\nEquinor recognises a gain/loss on disposal of a subsidiary when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the former subsidiary is recognised at fair value. When partially divesting subsidiaries which do not constitute a business, and where the remaining investment in the former subsidiary is an associate or a jointly controlled investment, Equinor only recognises the gain or loss on the divested part within Other income or Operating expenses, respectively. The remaining interest in the former subsidiary is initially not remeasured, and subsequently accounted for using the equity method.\n\n## After-tax disposals\n\nOn the NCS, all disposals of assets are performed including the tax base (after-tax). Any gain includes the release of tax liabilities previously recognised related to the assets in question and is recognised in full in Other income in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified separately as held for sale in the Consolidated balance sheet when a sale is highly probable. This condition is met when an asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, Equinor's management is committed to the sale, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. In Equinor, these requirements are normally met when management has approved a negotiated letter of intent with the counterparties (a 'DGC'). Liabilities directly associated with the assets classified as held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sales transaction, are also classified separately. The net assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAccounting judgement regarding acquisitions Determining whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination requires judgement to be applied on a case-by-case basis. Acquisitions are assessed to establish whether the transaction represents a business combination or an",

        "page_content": "asset purchase, and the conclusion may materially a/ffect the financial statements both in the transaction period and subsequent periods. Similar assessments are performed upon the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation. Depending on the specific facts, acquisitions of exploration and evaluation licences for which a development decision has not yet been made have largely been concluded to represent asset purchases, while purchases of producing assets have largely been concluded to represent business acquisitions.\n\n## Accounting judgement regarding partial\n\n## divestments\n\nThe policy regarding partial divestments of subsidiaries is based on careful consideration of the requirements and scope of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The conclusion requires judgement to be applied on a case-by-case basis, considering the substance of the transactions. In evaluating the standards' requirements, Equinor acknowledges pending considerations related to several relevant and similar issues which have been postponed by the IASB in anticipation of concurrent consideration at a later date. Where assets are transferred into separate legal entities concurrently with a portion of the entities' shares being sold to a third party, thereby resulting in Equinor's loss of control of those asset-owning subsidiaries, and where investments in joint ventures are established simultaneously, Equinor has concluded to only recognise the gain on the divested portion.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## 2022\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of BeGreen\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Equinor closed a transaction with the Bregentved Group and members of the executive board of BeGreen Solar Aps to acquire 100% of BeGreen Solar Aps for a cash consideration of USD 277 million (EUR 260 million) and a consideration contingent on successful delivery of future solar projects above an agreed MW threshold. BeGreen Solar Aps is a Danish solar developer. At closing, USD 226 million (EUR 213 million) of the cash consideration was paid and recognised in the REN segment.\n\n## Acquisition of Triton Power\n\nOn 1 September 2022, Equinor and SSE Thermal Generation Holdings Limited (SSE Thermal) closed a transaction to acquire the UK power company Triton Power Holdings Ltd (Triton Power) from Triton Power Partners LP owned by Energy Capital Partners (ECP). Equinor's share of the consideration was USD 141 million (GBP 120 million), after adjustments that mainly related to net debt and working capital. The key plant included in the purchase of Triton Power is the Saltend Power Station with an installed capacity of 1.2 GW. Equinor and SSE Thermal own 50% each of Triton Power, and Equinor is accounting for the investment under the equity method as a joint venture in the MMP segment.\n\n## Acquisition of Statfjord licence shares\n\nOn 31 May 2022, Equinor closed a transaction to acquire all of Spirit Energy's interests in production licences in the Statfjord area which covers the Norwegian and UK Continental Shelves and consists of three integrated production platforms and satellite\n\nsubsea installations. All licences are operated by Equinor. Spirit Energy's ownership shares in the licences covered by the transaction range from 11.56% to 48.78%. The cash consideration received was USD 193 million, whereof USD 25 million related to Spirit's lifting of volumes on Equinor's behalf in June 2022. The assets and liabilities acquired have been reflected in accordance with the principles in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The transaction is reflected in the E&P Norway and E&P International segments with a cash consideration of USD 96 million and USD 72 million, respectively.\n\nIn the segment E&P Norway, the acquisition resulted in an increase of USD 98 million in property, plant and equipment, an increase of USD 390 million in asset retirement obligation, a reduction of deferred tax liability of USD 298 million and an increase in taxes payable of USD 98 million. In the segment E&P International, the acquisition resulted in an increase of USD 98 million in property, plant and equipment, an increase of USD 241 million in asset retirement obligation and an increase of deferred tax asset of USD 86 million.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Ekofisk and Martin Linge on the Norwegian Continental Shelf\n\nOn 30 September 2022, Equinor closed a transaction with Sval Energi AS to divest Equinor's entire ownership share in the Greater Ekofisk Area including its share in Norpipe Oil AS, and a 19% ownership share in Martin Linge. The cash consideration paid upon closing of the transaction amounted to USD 293 million after interim period settlement. In addition, an estimated contingent consideration of USD 169 million linked to realised oil\n\nand gas prices for 2022 and 2023 was recognised. Equinor retained a 51% ownership share in Martin Linge and continues as operator of the field. The disposal resulted in a decrease in property, plant and equipment of USD 1,493 million, a decrease in asset retirement obligation of USD 376 million, a decrease in deferred tax liability of USD 597 million and a decrease in taxes payable of USD 686 million. A post-tax gain of USD 655 million is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the E&P Norway segment.\n\n## Exit Russia\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Equinor announced that it had decided to stop new investments in Russia and start the process of exiting Equinor's joint arrangements. Based on this decision, Equinor evaluated its assets in Russia and recognised net impairments of USD 1,083 million in the first quarter, of which USD 251 million was related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and USD 832 million was related to investments accounted for using the equity method. The impairments were net of contingent consideration from the time of acquiring the assets. The impairments were recognised in the line items Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses and Exploration expenses in the Consolidated statement of income based on the nature of the impaired assets and reflected in the E&P International segment. During the second quarter, Equinor transferred its participating interests in four Russian entities to Rosneft and was released from all future commitments and obligations with no material impact on the financial statements. The ownership interests in Kharyaga were transferred to the operator.",

Equinor has assessed the accounting impact of certain commitments arising from such contracts entered into prior to the invasion and deem the impact to be immaterial.\n\n## 10% of Dogger Bank C\n\nOn 10 February 2022, Equinor closed the transaction with Eni to sell a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank C project in the UK for a total consideration of USD 91 million (GBP 68 million), resulting in a gain of USD 87 million (GBP 65 million). After closing, Equinor's ownership share is 40%. Equinor continues to equity account for the remaining investment as a joint venture. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment.\n\n## Held for sale\n\n## Equinor Energy Ireland Limited\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Equinor entered into an agreement with Vermilion Energy Inc (Vermilion) to sell Equinor's non-operated equity position in the Corrib gas project in Ireland. The transaction covers a sale of 100% of the shares in Equinor Energy Ireland Limited (EEIL). EEIL owns 36.5% of the Corrib field alongside the operator Vermilion (20%) and Nephin Energy (43.5%). Equinor and Vermilion have agreed a consideration of USD 434 million before closing adjustments and contingent consideration linked to 2022 production level and gas prices. Closing is dependent on\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ngovernmental approval and is expected to take place during the first quarter 2023.\n\n## 2021\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Wento\n\nOn 5 May 2021, Equinor completed a transaction to acquire 100% of the shares in Polish onshore renewables developer Wento from the private equity firm Enterprise Investors for a cash consideration of USD 117 million (EUR 98 million) after net cash adjustments. The assets and liabilities related to the acquired business were recognised under the acquisition method. The acquisition resulted in an increase of Equinor's intangible assets of USD 46 million and goodwill of USD 59 million. The goodwill reflects the expected synergies, competence and access to the Polish renewables market obtained in the acquisition. The transaction has been accounted for in the REN segment.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Equinor Refining Denmark A/S\n\nOn 31 December 2021, Equinor Danmark A/S closed the transaction with the Klesch Group to sell 100% of the shares in Equinor Refining Denmark A/S (ERD). Klesch paid USD 48 million of the total estimated consideration at closing. ERD consists of the Kalundborg refinery and associated terminals and infrastructure. Following an impairment earlier in 2021, the disposal resulted in an immaterial loss. Prior to transaction closing, Equinor received USD 335 million in extraordinary dividend and repayment of paid-in capital from ERD.\n\nFollowing the disposal, a gain of USD 167 million was recycled from Other comprehensive income (OCI) to the Consolidated statement of income in the line item Other income and has been reflected in the MMP segment.\n\n## Terra Nova\n\nOn 8 September 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with Cenovus and Murphy to sell 100% of its interest, which includes a release of any future obligations and liabilities, in the Terra Nova asset in o/ffshore Canada. The transaction was accounted for in the E&P International segment. The consideration paid, the net carrying amount and the impact to the Consolidated statement of income are immaterial.\n\n## Bakken onshore unconventional field\n\nOn 26 April 2021, Equinor closed the transaction to divest its interests in the Bakken field in the US states of North Dakota and Montana to Grayson Mill Energy, backed by EnCap Investments for an estimated total consideration of USD 819 million, including interim period settlement, for which payment was received in the first half of 2021. The asset had been impaired in 2021 prior to closing. Subsequent to closing, insignificant losses were recorded and are presented in the line item Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income in the E&P USA segment.\n\n## 10% of Dogger Bank Farm A and B\n\nOn 26 February 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with Eni to sell a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank Wind Farm A and B assets in the UK for a total consideration of USD 285 million (GBP 206 million),\n\nresulting in a gain of USD 280 million (GBP 203 million). After closing, Equinor has a 40% shareholding in Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B, and will continue to equity account for the remaining investment as a joint venture. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment.\n\n## Non-operated interest in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets on the US east coast\n\nOn 29 January 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with BP to sell 50% of the non-operated interests in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets for a preliminary total consideration after interim period adjustments of USD 1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of USD 1.1 billion for the divested part, of which USD 500 million had been prepaid at the end of December 2020. Through this transaction, the two companies have established a strategic partnership for further growth within o/ffshore wind in the USA. Following the transaction, Equinor remains the operator with a 50% interest. Equinor consolidated the assets until transaction closing, and thereafter the investments are classified as joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7. Total revenues and other income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nEquinor presents Revenue from contracts with customers and Other revenue as a single caption, Revenues, in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and other merchandise is recognised when a customer obtains control of those products, which normally is when title passes at point of delivery, based on the contractual terms of the agreements. Each such sale normally represents a single performance obligation. In the case of natural gas, which is delivered on a continuous basis through pipelines, sales are completed over time in line with the delivery of the actual physical quantities.\n\nSales and purchases of physical commodities are presented on a gross basis as Revenues from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation] respectively in the Consolidated statement of income. When the contracts are deemed financial instruments or part of Equinor's trading activities, they are settled and presented on a net\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nbasis as Other revenue. Reference is made to note 28 Financial instruments and fair value measurement for a description of accounting policies regarding derivatives. Sales of Equinor's own produced oil and gas volumes are always reflected gross as Revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nRevenues from the production of oil and gas in which Equinor shares an interest with other companies are recognised on the basis of volumes lifted and sold to customers during the period (the sales method). Where Equinor has lifted and sold more than the ownership interest, an accrual is recognised for the cost of the overlift. Where Equinor has lifted and sold less than the ownership interest, costs are deferred for the underlift.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nItems representing a form of revenue, or which are related to revenue from contracts with customers, are presented as Other revenue if they do not qualify as revenue from contracts with customers. These other revenue items include taxes paid in-kind under certain production sharing agreements (PSAs) and the net impact of commodity trading and commodity-based derivative instruments related to sales contracts or revenue-related risk management.\n\n## Transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nEquinor markets and sells the Norwegian State's share of oil and gas production from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). The Norwegian State's participation in petroleum activities is organised through the SDFI (the Norwegian State's Direct Financial Interests). All purchases and sales of the SDFI's oil production are classified as purchases [net of inventory variation] and revenues from contracts with customers, respectively.\n\nEquinor sells, in its own name, but for the SDFI's account and risk, the SDFI's production of natural gas. These gas sales and related expenditures refunded by the SDFI are presented net in the Consolidated financial statements. Natural gas sales made in the name of Equinor's subsidiaries are also presented net of the SDFI's share in the Consolidated statement of income, but this activity is reflected gross in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Accounting judgement related to transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nWhether to account for the transactions gross or net involves the use of significant accounting judgement. In making the judgement, Equinor has considered whether it controls the State-originated crude\n\noil volumes prior to onwards sales to third party customers. Equinor directs the use of the volumes, and although certain benefits from the sales subsequently flow to the SDFI, Equinor purchases the crude oil volumes from the SDFI and obtains substantially all the remaining benefits. On that basis, Equinor has concluded that it acts as principal in these sales.\n\nRegarding gas sales, Equinor concluded that ownership of the gas had not been transferred from the SDFI to Equinor. Although Equinor has been granted the ability to direct the use of the volumes, all the benefits from the sales of these volumes flow to the SDFI. On that basis, Equinor is not considered the principal in the sale of the SDFI's natural gas volumes.\n\nReference is made to note 27 Related parties for detailed financial information regarding transactions performed between Equinor and SDFI.",

The line item Other foreign currency exchange gains/(losses) includes a fair value loss from derivatives related to non-current debt of USD 691 million in 2022, a loss of USD 702 million in 2021 and a gain of USD 796 million in 2020.\n\nThe line item Gains/(losses) other derivative financial instruments primarily includes fair value changes from interest rate related derivatives, with a loss of USD 1,760 million and USD 724 million in 2022 and 2021 respectively, and a gain of USD 432 million in 2020.\n\nThe line item Interest expense bonds and bank loans and net interest on related derivatives includes interest expenses of USD 918 million, USD 990 million, and USD 1,031 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from the financial liabilities at amortised cost category. It also includes net interest on related derivatives from the fair value through profit or loss category, amounting to a net interest expense of USD 111 million for 2022, net interest income of USD 94 million and USD 79 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 11. Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax in the Consolidated statement of income comprises current and deferred tax expense. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income except when it relates to items recognised in OCI.\n\nCurrent tax consists of the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years. Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures are analysed individually. The outcomes of tax disputes are mostly binary in nature, and in each case the most likely amount for probable liabilities to be paid (including penalties) or assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already been made) is recognised within Current tax or Deferred tax as appropriate. Uplift benefit on the NCS is recognised when the deduction is included in the current year tax return and impacts taxes payable.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to di/fferences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and on unused tax losses and credits carried\n\nforward, subject to the initial recognition exemption. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised. For a deferred tax asset to be recognised based on future taxable income, convincing evidence is required, considering the existence of contracts, production of oil or gas in the near future based on volumes of expected reserves, observable prices in active markets, expected volatility of trading profits, expected foreign currency rate movements and similar facts and circumstances.\n\nWhen an asset retirement obligation or a lease contract is initially reflected in the accounts, a deferred tax liability and a corresponding deferred tax asset are recognised simultaneously and accounted for in line with other deferred tax items. The applied policy is in line with an amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes, reducing the scope of the initial recognition exemption, which is e/ffective from 1 January 2023.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding income tax Equinor incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions and may recognise significant changes to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. There may be uncertainties\n\nrelated to interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations regarding amounts in Equinor's tax returns, which are filed in a number of tax regimes. For cases of uncertain tax treatments, it may take several years to complete the discussions with relevant tax authorities or to reach resolutions of the appropriate tax positions through litigation.\n\nThe carrying values of income tax related assets and liabilities are based on Equinor's interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates, including the most likely outcomes of uncertain tax treatments, is dependent upon proper application of at times very complex sets of rules, the recognition of changes in applicable rules and, in the case of deferred tax assets, management's ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss carry forward positions against future income taxes. Climate-related matters and the transition to carbon-neutral energy-consumption globally have increased the uncertainty in determining key business assumptions used to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets through su/fficient future taxable income before tax losses expire.",

The changes were e/ffective from 1 January 2020 and provided companies with a direct tax deduction in the special petroleum tax instead of tax depreciation over six years. In addition, the tax uplift benefit, was recognised over one year instead of four years. Tax depreciation towards the ordinary o/ffshore corporate tax was continued with a six-year depreciation profile.\n\nOn 17 June 2022, the Norwegian Parliament adopted amendments to the Petroleum Tax Act to convert the special tax for petroleum activities to a cash flow tax. The amendments were e/ffective 1 January 2022 and maintains the marginal rate for special petroleum tax and corporate income tax at 56% and 22% respectively but allows for cost of investments in the year of investment and calculated corporate income tax to be deducted in the special petroleum tax base. Uplift deductions for investments incurred after 1 January 2022 was discontinued. The uplift deduction rate under the temporary rules was reduced to 17.69% for 2022 and further reduced to 12.4% as from 2023.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\n## UK\n\nOn 23 May 2022, the UK introduced a new levy intended to tax windfall profits on oil and gas production from the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, called the Energy (Oil & Gas) Profits Levy Act 2022 (EPL).\n\nEPL was introduced as a new temporary tax at the rate of 25% from 26 May 2022 to 31 December 2022, and further increased to 35% from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028. It applies to profits on transactions from that date forward with no tax relief for prior expenditures or brought forward losses and with no EPL tax relief for interest and decommissioning costs. Capital cost incurred since 26 May 2022 are eligible for an EPL deductible uplift of 80% until 31 December 2022 and thereafter at 29% for expenditure other than that in respect of de-carbonisation where the rate of uplift remains at 80%. EPL losses can be carried forward without limitation and carried back for one year.\n\n## US\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in the USA. As from 2023, under the IRA a Corporate Minimum Tax on Book Earnings (BMT) applies a 15% tax on adjusted financial statement income. The enactment of the IRA had no impact in 2022.",

The rates are influenced by earnings composition between tax regimes with lower statutory tax rates and tax regimes with higher statutory tax rates.\n- 2)  The Norwegian petroleum income is taxable at a tax rate of 71.8% after deduction for 22% corporate tax in the special petroleum tax basis.\n- 3)  When calculating the petroleum tax of 71.8% on income from the Norwegian continental shelf, an additional tax-free allowance (uplift) was previously granted on the basis of the original capitalised cost of o/ffshore production installations.\n\nPreviously, a 5.2% uplift could be deducted from taxable income for a period of four years starting when the capital expenditure was incurred. On 17 June 2022, the Norwegian Parliament adopted amendments to the Petroleum Tax Act and converted the special tax for petroleum activities to a cash flow tax. The amendments were e/ffective 1 January 2022. Uplift deductions for investments incurred after 1 January 2022 were discontinued. At year-end 2022, un-recognised uplift credits were zero, compared to USD 272 million at year-end 2021.\n\nFor 2020 and 2021, temporary rules enacted under the Covid-19 pandemic allowed direct deduction of the whole uplift at a rate of 24% in the year the capital expenditure was incurred. This rate was reduced to 17.69% for 2022, and further reduced to 12.4% on capital expenditures incurred on investments eligible under the temporary rules as from 2023.\n\n- 4)  An amount of USD 4,401 million of previously un-recognised deferred tax assets was recognised in 2022, resulting in a lower e/ffective tax rate for 2022 compared to 2021. More than 90% of the recognition relates to the US, that after a history of significant losses, is now recording profits. Projected future taxable income demonstrates that it is probable that the unused tax losses carried forward can be utilised in the nearest future. The tax value of unused accumulated losses recognised as a deferred tax asset in the US, amounts to USD 2,738 million at year-end 2022. A 30% decline in commodity prices, considered to represent a reasonably possible change, would have an immaterial impact on the recognised amount.",

The majority of the unrecognised tax losses that cannot be carried forward indefinitely expire after 2027. The unrecognised tax credits expire from 2030, while the unrecognised deductible temporary di/fferences do not expire under the current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because currently there is insu/fficient evidence to support that future taxable profits will be available to secure utilisation of the benefits.\n\nAt year-end 2022, unrecognised deferred tax assets in Angola and Canada represents USD 636 million and USD 346 million, respectively, of the total unrecognised deferred tax assets of USD 2,027 million. Similar amounts for 2021 were USD 4,206 million in the USA and USD 749 million in Angola, respectively, of a total of USD 6,514 million. The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets originate from several di/fferent tax jurisdictions.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Note 12. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reflected at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of an asset retirement obligation, exploration costs transferred from intangible assets and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. Proceeds from production ahead of a project's final approval are regarded as 'early production' and is recognised as revenue rather than as a reduction of acquisition cost. Contingent consideration included in the acquisition of an asset or group of similar assets is initially measured at its fair value, with later changes in fair value other than due to the passage of time reflected in the book value of the asset or group of assets, unless the asset is impaired. Property, plant and equipment include costs relating to expenditures incurred under the terms of production sharing agreements (PSAs) in certain countries, and which qualify for recognition as assets of Equinor. State-owned entities in the respective countries, however, normally hold the legal title to such PSA-based property, plant and equipment.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Inspection and overhaul costs, associated with regularly scheduled major maintenance programmes planned and carried out at recurring intervals exceeding one\n\nyear, are capitalised and amortised over the period to the next scheduled inspection and overhaul. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures, development expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of production wells, and field-dedicated transport systems for oil and gas are capitalised as Producing oil and gas properties within Property, plant and equipment. Such capitalised costs, when designed for significantly larger volumes than the reserves from already developed and producing wells, are depreciated using the unit of production method (UoP) based on proved reserves expected to be recovered from the area during the concession or contract period. Depreciation of production wells uses the UoP method based on proved developed reserves, and capitalised acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using the UoP method based on total proved reserves. In the rare circumstances where the use of proved reserves fails to provide an appropriate basis reflecting the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed, a more appropriate reserve estimate is used. Depreciation of other assets and transport systems used by several fields is calculated on the basis of their estimated useful lives, normally using the straight-line method.

        "page_content": "the item is depreciated separately. For exploration and production assets, Equinor has established separate depreciation categories which as a minimum distinguish between platforms, pipelines and wells.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis, and changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in Other income or Operating expenses, respectively, in the period the item is derecognised.\n\nMonetary or non-monetary grants from governments, when related to property, plant and equipment and considered reasonably certain, are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet as a deduction to the carrying value of the asset and subsequently recognised in the Consolidated statement of income over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.\n\n## Research and development\n\nEquinor undertakes research and development both on a funded basis for licence holders and on an unfunded basis for projects at its own risk, developing innovative technologies to create opportunities and enhance the value of current and future assets. Expenses relate both to in-house resources and the use of suppliers. Equinor's own share of the licence holders' funding and the total costs of the unfunded projects are considered for capitalisation under the applicable IFRS requirements. Subsequent to initial recognition, any capitalised development costs are accounted for in the same manner\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nas Property, plant and equipment. Costs not qualifying for capitalisation are expensed as incurred, see note 9 Auditor's remuneration and Research and development expenditures for more details.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding determining oil and gas reserves\n\nReserves quantities are, by definition, discovered, remaining, recoverable and economic. Recoverable oil and gas quantities are always uncertain. Estimating reserves is complex and based on a high degree of professional judgement involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production, historical recovery and processing yield factors and installed plant operating capacity. The reliability of these estimates depends on both the quality and availability of the technical and economic data and the e/fficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty; Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved oil and gas reserves may impact the carrying amounts of oil and gas producing assets, as changes in the proved reserves, will impact the unit of production rates used for depreciation and amortisation. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, estimates of proved reserves only reflect the period before the contracts providing the right to operate expire. For future development\n\nprojects, proved reserves estimates are included only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and execution and when relevant governmental and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured.\n\nProved reserves are divided into proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or where the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major capital expenditure is required. Undrilled well locations can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves if a development plan is in place indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless specific circumstances justify a longer time horizon. Specific circumstances are for instance fields which have large up-front investments in o/ffshore infrastructure, such as many fields on the NCS, where drilling of wells is scheduled to continue for much longer than five years. For unconventional reservoirs where continued drilling of new wells is a major part of the investments, such as the US onshore assets, the proved reserves are always limited to proved well locations scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals based on industry standards and are governed by the oil and gas rules and disclosure requirements in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations S-K and S-X, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\n\nrequirements for supplemental oil and gas disclosures. The estimates have been based on a 12-month average product price and on existing economic conditions and operating methods as required, and recovery of the estimated quantities have a high degree of certainty (at least a 90% probability). An independent third party has evaluated Equinor's proved reserves estimates, and the results of this evaluation do not di/ffer materially from Equinor's estimates.\n\nEstimation uncertainty; Expected oil and gas reserves Changes in the expected oil and gas reserves may materially impact the amounts of asset retirement obligations, as a consequence of timing of the removal activities. It will also impact value-in-use calculations for oil and gas assets, possibly a/ffecting impairment testing and the recognition of deferred tax assets. Expected oil and gas reserves are the estimated remaining, commercially recoverable quantities, based on Equinor's judgement of future economic conditions, from projects in operation or decided for development. As per Equinor's internal guidelines, expected reserves are defined as the 'forward looking mean reserves' when based on a stochastic prediction approach. In some cases, a deterministic prediction method is used, in which case the expected reserves are the deterministic base case or best estimate. Expected reserves are therefore typically larger than proved reserves as defined by the SEC, which are high confidence estimates with at least a 90% probability of recovery when a probabilistic approach is used. Expected oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals based on industry standards and classified in accordance with the Norwegian resource classification system issued by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13. Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Intangible assets including goodwill\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Intangible assets include acquisition cost for oil and gas prospects, expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, goodwill, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets relating to expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources are not amortised. When the decision to develop a particular area is made, related intangible exploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to Property, plant and equipment.\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each cash generating unit (CGU), or group of units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. In acquisitions made on a post-tax basis according to the rules on the NCS, a provision for deferred tax is reflected in the accounts based on the di/fference between the acquisition cost and the tax depreciation basis transferred from the seller. The o/ffsetting entry to such deferred tax amounts is reflected as goodwill, which is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs on whose tax depreciation basis the deferred tax has been computed.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, are depreciated over their useful life using the straightline method.\n\n## Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditures\n\nEquinor uses the successful e/fforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration costs. Expenditures to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, including signature bonuses, expenditures to drill and equip exploratory wells and evaluation expenditures are capitalised within Intangible assets as Exploration expenditures and Acquisition costs - oil and gas prospects. Geological and geophysical costs and other exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred.\n\nExploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas remain capitalised as intangible assets during the evaluation phase of the discovery. This evaluation is normally finalised within one year after well completion. If, following the evaluation, the exploratory well has not found potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, the previously capitalised costs are evaluated for derecognition or tested for impairment. Any derecognition or impairment is classified as Exploration expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures related to o/ffshore wells that find proved reserves, are transferred to Property, plant and equipment at the time of sanctioning of the development project. The timing from evaluation of a discovery until a project is sanctioned could take several years depending on the location and maturity, including existing infrastructure, of the area of discovery, whether a host government agreement is in place, the complexity of the project and the financial robustness of the project. For onshore wells where no sanction is required, the transfer to Property, plant and equipment occurs at the time when a well is ready for production.\n\nFor exploration and evaluation asset acquisitions (farm-in arrangements) in which Equinor has decided to fund a portion of the selling partner's exploration and/or future development expenditures (carried interests), these expenditures are reflected in the Consolidated financial statements as and when the exploration and development work progresses.\n\nEquinor reflects exploration and evaluation asset disposals (farm-out arrangements) on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recognition. Consideration from the sale of an undeveloped part of an asset reduces the carrying amount of the asset. If the consideration exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess amount is reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under\n\nOther income. Equal-valued exchanges (swaps) of exploration and evaluation assets with only immaterial cash considerations are accounted for at the carrying amounts of the assets given up with no gain or loss recognition.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding exploration activities Exploratory wells that have found reserves, but where classification of those reserves as proved depends on whether a major capital expenditure can be justified, will remain capitalised during the evaluation phase for the findings on the exploration wells. Thereafter it will be considered a trigger for impairment evaluation of the well if no development decision is planned for the near future, and there moreover are no concrete plans for future drilling in the licence. Judgements as to whether these expenditures should remain capitalised, be derecognised or impaired in the period may materially a/ffect the carrying values of these assets and consequently, the operating income for the period.",

Impairments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets including goodwill\n\nEquinor assesses individual assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped into cash generating units (CGUs) which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Normally, separate CGUs are individual oil and gas fields or plants. Each unconventional asset play is considered a single CGU when no cash inflows from parts of the play can be reliably identified as being largely independent of the cash inflows from other parts of the play. In impairment evaluations, the carrying amounts of CGUs are determined on a basis consistent with that of the recoverable amount.\n\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to which the unproved properties belong may exceed its recoverable amount, and at least once a year. Exploratory wells that have found reserves, but where classification of those reserves as proved depends on whether major capital expenditure can be justified or where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the\n\nsuccessful completion of further exploration work, will remain capitalised during the evaluation phase for the exploratory finds. If, following evaluation, an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the previously capitalised costs are tested for impairment. After the initial evaluation phase for a well, it will be considered a trigger for impairment testing of a well if no development decision is planned for the near future and there is no firm plan for future drilling in the licence.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, to which the goodwill relates. When impairment testing goodwill originally recognised as an o/ffsetting item to the computed deferred tax provision in a post-tax transaction on the NCS, the remaining amount of the deferred tax provision will factor into the impairment evaluations.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are presented in the Consolidated statement of income as Exploration expenses or Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses, on the basis of the nature of the impaired assets as either exploration assets (intangible exploration assets) or development and producing assets (property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets), respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nThe recoverable amount applied in Equinor's impairment assessments is normally estimated value in use. Equinor may also apply the assets' fair value less cost of disposal as the recoverable amount when such a value is available, reasonably reliable, and based on a recent and comparable transaction.\n\nValue in use is determined using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated future cash flows are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent management's best estimates of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the assets, as set down in Equinor's most recently approved forecasts. Assumptions and economic conditions in establishing the forecasts are reviewed by management on a regular basis and updated at least annually. For assets and CGUs with an expected useful life or timeline for production of expected oil and natural gas reserves extending beyond five years, including planned onshore production from shale assets with a long development and production horizon, the forecasts reflect expected production volumes, and the related cash flows include project or asset specific estimates reflecting the relevant period. Such estimates are established based on Equinor's principles and assumptions and are consistently applied.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset or CGU and discounted\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nusing a real post-tax discount rate which is based on Equinor's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Country risk specific to a project is included as a monetary adjustment to the projects' cash flow. Equinor considers country risk primarily as an unsystematic risk. The cash flow is adjusted for risk that influences the expected cash flow of a project and which is not part of the project itself. The use of post-tax discount rates in determining value in use does not result in a materially di/fferent determination of the need for, or the amount of, impairment that would be required if pre-tax discount rates had been used.\n\n## Impairment reversals\n\nA previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount of the asset or CGU that would have been reflected, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised in prior periods. Impairment of unsuccessful wells is reversed only to the extent that conditions for impairment are no longer present. Previously recognised impairments of goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding impairment Evaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may to a large extent depend upon\n\nthe selection of key assumptions about the future. In Equinor's line of business, judgement is involved in determining what constitutes a CGU. Development in production, infrastructure solutions, markets, product pricing, management actions and other factors may over time lead to changes in CGUs such as splitting one original CGU into several CGUs.\n\nThe key assumptions used will bear the risk of change based on the inherent volatile nature of macroeconomic factors such as future commodity prices and discount rates, and uncertainty in asset specific factors such as reserve estimates and operational decisions impacting the production profile or activity levels for our oil and natural gas properties. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will also a/ffect value in use, especially for assets on the NCS, where the functional currency is NOK. When estimating the recoverable amount, the expected cash flow approach is applied to reflect uncertainties in timing and amounts inherent in the assumptions used in the estimated future cash flows. For example, climaterelated matters (see also Note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes) are expected to have a pervasive e/ffect on the energy industry, a/ffecting not only supply, demand and commodity prices, but also technology changes, increased emission-related levies, and other matters with mainly mid-term and long-term e/ffects. These e/ffects have been factored into the price assumptions used for estimating future cash flows using probabilityweighted scenario analyses.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows, reflecting Equinor's, market participants' and other external sources' assumptions about the future and discounted to their present value, involve complexity. In order to establish relevant future cash flows, impairment testing requires long-term assumptions to be made concerning a number of economic factors such as future market prices, refinery margins, foreign currency exchange rates and future output, discount rates, impact of the timing of tax incentive regulations, and political and country risk among others. Long-term assumptions for major economic factors are made at a group level, and there is a high degree of reasoned judgement involved in establishing these assumptions, in determining other relevant factors such as forward price curves, in estimating production outputs, and in determining the ultimate terminal value of an asset.",

        "page_content": "## Exploration & Production Norway\n\nIn 2022, the net impairment reversal was mainly caused by increased price estimates and changed gas export strategy. In 2021, the net impairment reversal was mainly due to increased price estimates and an upward reserve revision.\n\n## Exploration & Production USA - onshore\n\nIn 2022, the impairment reversal was caused by increased gas price assumptions, while in 2021 the net impairment was caused by revision of reserves and sale of an asset.\n\n## Exploration & Production USA - o/ffshore Gulf of Mexico\n\nIn 2022, the impairment reversal was caused by increased price assumptions and higher reserves estimates, while in 2021, the impairment was due to a negative reserve revision.\n\n## Exploration & Production International - Europe and Asia\n\nIn 2022, the net impairment was mainly caused by the decision to exit Russia (see note 6 Acquisitions and disposals). This was to a large extent o/ffset by a reversal on Mariner in the UK mainly due to optimisation of the production profile and higher prices, supported by a slight increase in reserves estimates. In 2021, the net impairment was mainly caused by downward reserve revisions partially o/ffset by higher prices.\n\n## Marketing, Midstream & Processing\n\nIn 2022 the net impairment reversal was mainly related to increased refinery margin assumptions, while in 2021, the impairment losses were caused by increased CO\u2082 fees and - quotas on a refinery and a classification to held for sale.\n\n## Accounting assumptions\n\nManagement's future commodity price assumptions and currency assumptions are applied when estimating value in use. While there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions, the commodity price assumptions as well as currency assumptions reflect management's best estimate of the price and currency development over the life of the Group's assets based on its view of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances, including energy demand development, energy and climate change policies as well as the speed of the energy transition, population and economic growth, geopolitical risks, technology and cost development and other factors. Management's best estimate also takes into consideration a range of external forecasts.\n\nEquinor has performed a thorough and broad analysis of the expected development in drivers for the di/fferent commodity markets and exchange rates. Significant uncertainty exists regarding future commodity price development due to the transition to a lower carbon economy, future supply actions by OPEC+ and other factors. The management's analysis of the expected development in drivers for the di/fferent commodity markets and exchange rates resulted in changes in the long-term price assumptions with e/ffect from the third quarter of 2022. The main changes with e/ffect for impairment and impairment reversal assessments are disclosed in the table below as price-points on pricecurves. Previously applied price-points from the third quarter of 2021 up to and including the second quarter of 2022 are provided in brackets.\n\n## Year\n\n| Prices in real terms 1)           |   2025 | 2025   |   2030 | 2030   |   2040 | 2040   |   2050 | 2050   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent Blend (USD/bbl)             |     75 | (70)   |   75   | (75)   |   70   | (69)   |   65   | (64)   |\n| European gas (USD/mmBtu) - TTF 2) |     20 | (7.3)  |    9.5 | (6.8)  |    9   | (8.2)  |    9   | (7.5)  |\n| Henry Hub (USD/mmBtu)             |      4 | (3.3)  |    3.7 | (3.4)  |    3.7 | (3.6)  |    3.7 | (3.6)  |\n| Electricity Germany (EUR/MWh)     |    115 | (65)   |   70   | (62)   |   57   | (64)   |   57   | (64)   |\n| EU ETS (EUR/tonne)                |     80 | (61)   |   80   | (70)   |  105   | (89)   |  130   | (108)  |\n\n- 1)  Basis year 2022.

        "page_content": "Climate considerations are included in the impairment calculations directly by estimating the CO\u2082 taxes in the cash flows. Indirectly, the expected e/ffect of climate change is also included in the estimated commodity prices where supply and demand are considered. The prices also have e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-o/ff of the projects. Furthermore, climate considerations are a part of the investment decisions following Equinor's strategy and commitments to the energy transition.\n\nNorway's Climate Action Plan for the period 20212030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO\u2082 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO\u2082 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/tonne in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nTo reflect that carbon will have a cost for all our assets the current best estimate is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates.\n\nThe long-term NOK currency exchange rates are expected to be unchanged compared to previous longterm assumptions. The NOK/USD rate from 2025 and onwards is kept at 8.50, the NOK/EUR at 10.0. The USD/ GBP rate is kept at 1.35.\n\nThe base discount rate applied in value in use calculations is 5.0% real after tax. The discount rate is derived from Equinor's weighted average cost of capital. For projects, mainly within the REN segment in periods with fixed low risk income, a lower discount rate will be considered. A derived pre-tax discount\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nrate is in the range of 42-102% for E&P Norway, 8-9% for E&P International, 6-9% for E&P USA and 7% for MMP depending on the asset's characteristics, such as specific tax treatments, cash flow profiles, and economic life. The pre-tax rates for 2021 were 18-32%, 5-9%, 6-7% and 7% respectively.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nCommodity prices have historically been volatile. Significant downward adjustments of Equinor's commodity price assumptions would result in impairment losses on certain producing and development assets in Equinor's portfolio including intangible assets that are subject to impairment assessment, while an opposite adjustment could lead to impairment-reversals. If a decline in commodity price forecasts over the lifetime of the assets was 30%, considered to represent a reasonably possible change, the impairment amount to be recognised could illustratively be in the region of USD 14 billion before tax e/ffects. See note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes for possible e/ffect of using the prices in a 1.5\u00baC compatible Net Zero Emission by 2050 scenario and the Announced Pledges Scenario as estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nThese illustrative impairment sensitivities, both based on a simplified method, assumes no changes to input factors other than prices; however, a price reduction of 30% or those representing Net Zero Emission scenario and Announced Pledges Scenario is likely to result in changes in business plans as well as other factors used when estimating an asset's recoverable amount. These associated changes reduce the stand-alone impact on the price sensitivities. Changes in such input factors would likely include a reduction in the cost level in the oil\n\nand gas industry as well as o/ffsetting foreign currency e/ffects, both of which have historically occurred following significant changes in commodity prices. The illustrative sensitivities are therefore not considered to represent a best estimate of an expected impairment impact, nor an estimated impact on revenues or operating income in such a scenario. A significant and prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would also result in mitigating actions by Equinor and its licence partners, as a reduction of oil and gas prices would impact drilling plans and production profiles for new and existing assets. Quantifying such impacts is considered impracticable, as it requires detailed technical, geological and economical evaluations based on hypothetical scenarios and not based on existing business or development plans.",

        "page_content": "## Note 15. Joint arrangements and associates\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Joint operations and similar arrangements, joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby Equinor and other parties undertake an activity subject to joint control, i.e. when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Such joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. In determining the appropriate classification, Equinor considers the nature of products and markets of the arrangements and whether the substance of the agreements is that the parties involved have rights to substantially all the arrangement's assets and obligations for the liabilities, or whether the parties involved have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Equinor accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in joint operations in accordance with the principles applicable to those particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nThose of Equinor's exploration and production licence activities that are within the scope of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements have been classified as joint operations. A considerable number of Equinor's unincorporated joint exploration and production activities are conducted through arrangements that\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nare not jointly controlled, either because unanimous consent is not required among all parties involved, or no single group of parties has joint control over the activity. Licence activities where control can be achieved through agreement between more than one combination of involved parties are considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 11, and these activities are accounted for on a pro-rata basis using Equinor's ownership share. Currently, Equinor uses IFRS 11 by analogy for all such unincorporated licence arrangements whether these are in scope of IFRS 11 or not. Reference is made to note 5 Segments for financial information related to Equinor's participation in joint operations within upstream activities.\n\nJoint ventures, in which Equinor has rights to the net assets, are accounted for using the equity method. These currently include the majority of Equinor's investments in the Renewables (REN) operating and reporting segment. Equinor's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures and investments in companies in which Equinor has neither control nor joint control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are classified as equity accounted investments.\n\nUnder the equity method, the investment is carried on the Consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in Equinor's share of net\n\nassets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. The part of an equity accounted investment's dividend distribution exceeding the entity's carrying amount in the Consolidated balance sheet is reflected as income from equity accounted investments in the Consolidated statement of income. Equinor will subsequently only reflect the share of net profit in the investment that exceeds the dividend already reflected as income. The Consolidated statement of income reflects Equinor's share of the results after tax of an equity accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equity accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented as part of Total revenues and other income, as investments in and participation with significant influence in other companies engaged in energy-related business activities is considered to be part of Equinor's main operating activities.\n\nAcquisition of ownership shares in joint ventures and other equity accounted investments in which the activity constitutes a business, are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applicable to business combinations. Please refer to note 6 Acquisitions and disposals for more details on acquisitions.\n\n## Equinor as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements\n\nIndirect operating expenses such as personnel expenses are accumulated in cost pools. These costs are allocated on an hours' incurred basis to business areas and Equinor-operated joint operations under IFRS 11 and to similar arrangements (licences) outside the scope of IFRS 11. Costs allocated to the other partners' share of operated joint operations and similar arrangements are reimbursed and only Equinor's share of the statement of income and balance sheet items related to Equinor-operated joint operations and similar arrangements are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income and the Consolidated balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Note 22. Pensions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEquinor has pension plans for employees that either provide a defined pension benefit upon retirement or a pension dependent on defined contributions and related returns. A portion of the contributions are provided for as notional contributions, for which the liability increases with a promised notional return, set equal to the actual return of assets invested through the ordinary defined contribution plan. For defined benefit plans, the benefit to be received by employees generally depends on many factors including length of service, retirement date and future salary levels.\n\nEquinor's proportionate share of multi-employer defined benefit plans is recognised as liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet as su/fficient information is considered available, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe cost of pension benefit plans is expensed over the period that the employees render services and become eligible to receive benefits. The calculation is performed by an external actuary. Equinor's net obligation from defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nis deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date, reflecting the maturity dates approximating the terms of Equinor's obligations. On 31 December 2022, the discount rate for the defined benefit plans in Norway was established on the basis of seven years' mortgage covered bonds interest rate extrapolated on a yield curve which matches the duration of Equinor's payment portfolio for earned benefits, which was calculated to be 13.5 years at the end of 2022. The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost are measured using the projected unit credit method. The assumptions for expected wage growth, expected rate of pension increase and the expected increase of social security base amount (G-amount) are based on agreed regulation in the plans, historical observations, future expectations of the assumptions and the relationship between these assumptions. For members in Norway, the mortality table K2013, issued by The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, is used as the best mortality estimate. Social security tax is calculated based on a pension plan's net funded status and is included in the defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe recognition of a net surplus for the funded plan is based on the assumption that the net assets represent a future value for Equinor, either as a possible distribution to premium fund which can\n\nbe used for future funding of new liabilities, or as disbursement of equity in the pension fund.\n\nThe net interest related to defined benefit plans is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net present value of the benefit obligation and is presented in the Consolidated statement of income within Net financial items. The di/fference between estimated interest income and actual return is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as actuarial gains/losses.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur, while actuarial gains and losses related to provision for termination benefits are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they occur. Due to the parent company Equinor ASA's functional currency being USD, the significant part of Equinor's pension obligations will be payable in a foreign currency (i.e. NOK). As a consequence, actuarial gains and losses related to the parent company's pension obligations include the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nContributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as pension costs in the period in which the contribution amounts are earned by the employees.\n\nNotional contribution plans, reported in the parent company Equinor ASA, are recognised as Pension liabilities with the actual value of the notional contributions and promised return at reporting date. Notional contributions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as periodic pension cost, while changes in fair value of the employees' notional assets are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under Net financial items.\n\nPeriodic pension cost is accumulated in cost pools and allocated to business areas and Equinor's operated joint operations (licences) on an hours' incurred basis and recognised in the Consolidated statement of income based on the function of the cost.",

        "page_content": "## Pension plans in Equinor\n\nThe main pension plans for Equinor ASA and its most significant subsidiaries are defined contribution plans which includes certain unfunded elements (notional contribution plans). In addition, several employees and former employees of the Equinor Group is a member of certain defined benefit plans. The benefit plan in Equinor ASA was closed in 2015 for new employees and for employees with more than 15 years to regular retirement age. Equinor's defined benefit plans are generally based on a minimum of 30 years of service and 66% of the final salary level, including an assumed benefit from the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The Norwegian companies in the group are subject to, and complies with, the requirements of the Norwegian Mandatory Company Pensions Act.\n\nThe defined benefit plans in Norway are managed and financed through Equinor Pensjon (Equinor's pension fund - hereafter Equinor Pension). Equinor Pension is an independent pension fund that covers the employees in Equinor's Norwegian companies. The pension fund's assets are kept separate from the company's and\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ngroup companies' assets. Equinor Pension is supervised by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (\"Finanstilsynet\") and is licenced to operate as a pension fund.\n\nEquinor has more than one defined benefit plan, but the disclosure is made in total since the plans are not subject to materially di/fferent risks. Pension plans outside Norway are not material and as such not disclosed separately. The tables in this note present pension costs on a gross basis before allocation to licence partners. In the Consolidated statement of income, the pension costs in Equinor ASA are presented net of costs allocated to licence partners.\n\nEquinor is also a member of a Norwegian national agreement-based early retirement plan ('AFP'), and the premium is calculated based on the employees' income but limited to 7.1 times the basic amount in the National Insurance scheme (7.1 G). The premium is payable for all employees until age 62. Pension from the AFP scheme will be paid from the AFP plan administrator to employees for their full lifetime.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\n## Net pension cost\n\n| (in USD million)            |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Notional contribution plans |     57 |     60 |     55 |\n| Defined benefit plans       |    188 |    216 |    184 |\n| Defined contribution plans  |    213 |    213 |    192 |\n| Total net pension cost      |    458 |    488 |    432 |\n\nIn addition to the pension cost presented in the table above, financial items related to defined benefit plans are included in the Consolidated statement of income within Net financial items.

        "page_content": "## Note 23. Provisions and other liabilities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Asset retirement obligations (ARO)\n\nProvisions for asset retirement obligations (ARO) are recognised when Equinor has an obligation (legal or constructive) to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Normally an obligation arises for a new facility, such as an oil and natural gas production or transportation facility, upon construction or installation. An obligation may also arise during the period of operation of a facility through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations or be based on commitments associated with Equinor's ongoing use of pipeline transport systems where removal obligations rest with the volume shippers.\n\nThe amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The cost is estimated based on current regulations and technology, considering relevant risks and uncertainties. The discount rate used in the calculation of the ARO is a market-based risk-free rate based on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows. The provisions are classified under Provisions in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nWhen a provision for ARO is recognised, a corresponding amount is recognised to increase the related property, plant and equipment and is subsequently depreciated as part of the property, plant and equipment. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding property, plant and equipment. When a decrease in the ARO related to a producing asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised as a reduction of Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses in the Consolidated statement of income. When an asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the ARO are recognised as they occur in Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nRemoval provisions associated with Equinor's role as shipper of volumes through third party transport systems are expensed as incurred.\n\nEstimation uncertainty regarding asset retirement obligations\n\nEstablishing the appropriate estimates for such obligations are based on historical knowledge combined with knowledge of ongoing technological developments, expectations about future regulatory and technological development and involve the application of judgement and an inherent risk of\n\nsignificant adjustments. The costs of decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities are many years into the future, and the removal technology and costs are constantly changing. The speed of the transition to renewable energy sources may also influence the production period, hence the timing of the removal activities. The estimates include assumptions of norms, rates and time required which can vary considerably depending on the assumed removal complexity. Moreover, changes in the discount rate and foreign currency exchange rates may impact the estimates significantly. As a result, the initial recognition of ARO and subsequent adjustments involve the application of significant judgement.",

Changes in ARO are reflected within Property, plant and equipment and Provisions and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn certain production sharing agreements (PSA), Equinor's estimated share of asset retirement obligation (ARO) is paid into an escrow account over the producing life of the field. These payments are considered down-payments of the liabilities and included in the line item Amounts charged against provisions and other liabilities.\n\nClaims and litigations mainly relate to expected payments for unresolved claims. The timing and amounts of potential settlements in respect of these claims are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are outside management's control. For further information on provisions and contingent liabilities, see note 26 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.",

        "page_content": "## Note 25. Leases\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Leases\n\nA lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At the date at which the underlying asset is made available for Equinor, the present value of future lease payments (including extension options considered reasonably certain to be exercised) is recognised as a lease liability. The present value is calculated using Equinor's incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use (RoU) asset is recognised, including lease payments and direct costs incurred at the commencement date. Lease payments are reflected as interest expense and a reduction of lease liabilities. The RoU assets are depreciated over the shorter of each contract's term and the assets' useful life.\n\nShort term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (regarded as such when the sum of nominal lease payments over the lease term do not exceed USD 500.000) are expensed or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity in which the leased asset is used.\n\nMany of Equinor's lease contracts, such as rig and vessel leases, involve several additional services and components, including personnel cost, maintenance, drilling related activities, and other items. For a number of these contracts, the additional services represent a not inconsiderable portion of the total\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\ncontract value. Non-lease components within lease contracts are accounted for separately for all underlying classes of assets and reflected in the relevant expense category or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity involved.\n\nAccounting judgement regarding leases In the oil and gas industry, where activity frequently is carried out through joint arrangements or similar arrangements, the application of IFRS 16 Leases requires evaluations of whether the joint arrangement or its operator is the lessee in each lease agreement and consequently whether such contracts should be reflected gross (100%) in the operator's financial statements, or according to each joint operation partner's proportionate share of the lease.\n\nIn many cases where an operator is the sole signatory to a lease contract of an asset to be used in the activities of a specific joint operation, the operator does so implicitly or explicitly on behalf of the joint arrangement. In certain jurisdictions, and importantly for Equinor as this includes the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), the concessions granted by the authorities establish both a right and an obligation for the operator to enter into necessary agreements in the name of the joint operations (licences).\n\nAs is the customary norm in upstream activities operated through joint arrangements, the\n\noperator will manage the lease, pay the lessor, and subsequently re-bill the partners for their share of the lease costs. In each such instance, it is necessary to determine whether the operator is the sole lessee in the external lease arrangement, and if so, whether the billings to partners may represent sub-leases, or whether it is in fact the joint arrangement which is the lessee, with each participant accounting for its proportionate share of the lease. Where all partners in a licence are considered to share the primary responsibility for lease payments under a contract, Equinor's proportionate share of the related lease liability and RoU asset will be recognised net by Equinor. When Equinor is considered to have the primary responsibility for the full external lease payments, the lease liability is recognised gross (100%). Equinor derecognises a portion of the RoU asset equal to the non-operator's interests in the lease, and replace it with a corresponding financial lease receivable, if a financial sublease is considered to exist between Equinor and the licence. A financial sublease will typically exist where Equinor enters into a contract in its own name, has the primary responsibility for the external lease payments, the underlying asset will only be used on one specific licence, and the costs and risks related to the use of the asset are carried by that specific licence. Depending on facts and circumstances in each case, the conclusions reached may vary between contracts and legal jurisdictions.",

Equinor's share of estimated expenditures to drill these wells amounts to USD 566 million. Additional wells that Equinor may become committed to participating in depending on\n\nprofitability and even the viability of Equinor's business in that jurisdiction. Equinor mitigates this risk by using local legal representatives and staying up to date with the legislation in the jurisdictions where activities are carried out. Occasionally, legal disputes arise from di/fference in interpretations. Equinor's legal department, together with local legal representatives, estimate the outcome from such legal disputes based on first-hand knowledge. Such estimates may di/ffer from the actual results.\n\nfuture discoveries in certain licences are not included in these numbers.\n\n## Other long-term commitments\n\nEquinor has entered into various long-term agreements for pipeline transportation as well as terminal use, processing, storage and entry/exit capacity commitments and commitments related to specific purchase agreements. The agreements ensure the rights to the capacity or volumes in question, but also impose on Equinor the obligation to pay for the agreed-upon service or commodity, irrespective of actual use. The contracts' terms vary, with durations of up to 2060.\n\nTake-or-pay contracts for the purchase of commodity quantities are only included in the table below if their contractually agreed pricing is of a nature that will or may deviate from the obtainable market prices for the commodity at the time of delivery.",

The total amount guaranteed at yearend 2022 is USD 1,725 million. The book value of the guarantees is immaterial.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Agbami dispute settlement agreement and licence extension\n\nDuring 2022, an agreement was reached in a threeyear long negotiation between the parties Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Chevron and Equinor. The parties have agreed to an extension of the operating licence period and the related Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for Oil Mining Lease (OML) 128 of the unitised Agbami field until 2042. At the same time, the parties agreed outstanding legal disputes related to the allocation between the parties of cost oil, tax oil and profit oil volumes. The settlement agreement awards Equinor with an amicable compensation for overlifted volumes, which will be payable over the 20-year licence extension. The amounts and timing of payments to be received depend on a number of factors related to operation of the field, as well as future oil prices and production volumes. Equinor will consequently recognise settlement payments when received, and no amounts have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of income or Balance sheet for 2022. The parties are currently undertaking necessary legal actions in order to formally close the legal disputes.\n\n## Claim from Petrofac regarding multiple variation order requests performed in Algeria (In Salah)\n\nPetrofac International (UAE) LLC ('PIUL') was awarded the EPC Contract to execute the ISSF Project (the In Salah Southern Fields Project which has finalised the development of 4 gas fields in central Algeria). Following suspension of activity after the terrorist attack at another gas field in Algeria (In Amenas) in 2013, PIUL issued multiple Variation Order Requests ('VoRs') related to the costs incurred for stand-by and remobilization costs after the evacuation of expatriates. Several VoRs have been paid, but the settlement of the remaining has been unsuccessful. PIUL initiated arbitration in August 2020 claiming an estimated amount of USD 533 million, of which Equinor holds a 31.85% share. Equinor's maximum exposure amounts to USD 163 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\n## Withholding tax dispute regarding remittances from Brazil to Norway\n\nRemittances made from Brazil for services are normally subject to withholding income tax. In 2012, Equinor's subsidiaries in Brazil filed a lawsuit to avoid paying this tax on remittances made to Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS for services without transfer of technology based on the Double Tax Treaty Brazil has with Norway. Court proceedings through several levels in the legal system have been ongoing since a first level decision in Equinor's favour was reached in 2013, and a final verdict has not yet been reached. Withholding tax has not been paid since 2014. Equinor's maximum exposure is estimated at approximately USD 146 million. Equinor is of the view that all applicable tax regulations have\n\nbeen applied in the case and that Equinor has a strong position. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## Suit for an annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest in BM-S-8 to Equinor\n\nIn March 2017, an individual connected to the Union of Oil Workers of Sergipe (Sindipetro) filed a class action suit against Petrobras, Equinor, and ANP - the Brazilian Regulatory Agency - to seek annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest and operatorship in BM-S-8 to Equinor, which was closed in November 2016 after approval by the partners and authorities. In February 2022, sentence in the annulment case was issued at the first instance level, and Equinor won on all merits. The case was appealed by the plainti/ff and Equinor has filed counter arguments. At the end of 2022, the acquired interest remains in Equinor's balance sheet, where the assets related to phase 1 have been reclassified to property, plant and equipment and the assets related to phase 2 are presented as intangible assets, all of which are part of the Exploration & Production International (E&P International) segment.\n\n## Brazilian law creating uncertainty regarding certain tax incentives\n\nEquinor is currently part in two legal matters in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil related to a law requiring taxpayers that benefits from ICMS tax incentives (i.e. Repetro) to deposit 10% of the savings made from such benefits into a state fund. Equinor is of the opinion that specific incentives so far relevant for the Roncador and Peregrino fields are not in scope of the law, while the state of Rio de Janeiro requires deposits to be",

Several legal actions to oppose the laws and related payments have therefore been initiated by both Equinor's peers and the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute (IBP). At year-end 2022, the maximum exposure for Equinor in these various matters has been estimated to a total of USD 132 million. Equinor is of the opinion that the law is unconstitutional, especially for Repetro incentives, and this will be upheld in future legal proceedings. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## KKD oil sands partnership\n\nCanadian tax authorities have issued a notice of reassessment for 2014 for Equinor's Canadian subsidiary which was party to Equinor's divestment of 40% of the KKD Oil Sands partnership at that time. The reassessment, which has been appealed, adjusts the allocation of the proceeds of disposition of certain Canadian resource properties from the partnership. Maximum exposure is estimated to be approximately USD 372 million. The appeal process with the Canadian tax authorities, as well as any subsequent litigation that may become necessary, may take several years. No taxes will become payable until the matter has been finally settled. Equinor is of the view that all applicable tax regulations have been applied in the case and that Equinor has a strong position. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## Resolved dispute with Norwegian tax authorities related to Equinor Service Center Belgium N.V\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Equinor received a decision from the Norwegian tax authorities related to the capital structure of the subsidiary Equinor\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nService Center Belgium N.V., concluding that the capital structure had to be based on the arm length's principle, a/ffecting the fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Equinor received a claim of USD 182 million that was paid in 2021. During 2022, the tax authorities reversed their decision and accepted Equinor's initial position. The tax payment has been reimbursed to Equinor, adjusted for changes in tax rates. The adjustment, which has been recognised as tax expense in the Consolidated statement of income in 2022, is considered immaterial.\n\n## Dispute with Norwegian tax authorities regarding R&D costs in the o/ffshore tax regime\n\nEquinor has an ongoing dispute regarding the level of Research & Development cost to be allocated to the o/ffshore tax regime. During 2022, the Oil Taxation O/ffice (OTO) informed Equinor that it had decided to accept Equinor's position regarding certain disputed items, resulting in a reduction in Equinor's maximum exposure. Further, Equinor has accepted an increase in taxable income for both onshore and o/ffshore tax. A previously recognised provision of USD 95 million has been reclassified to current tax payable. Equinor's Income tax expense was not a/ffected by this development, and the remaining expected maximum exposure related to R&D costs in the o/ffshore tax regime is considered immaterial.\n\n## Dispute with Norwegian tax authorities regarding internal pricing of natural gas liquids\n\nThe Oil Taxation O/ffice has challenged the internal pricing of certain products of natural gas liquids sold from Equinor Energy AS to Equinor ASA in the years 2011-2020. During 2022 there has been development in various elements of these cases, where parts of the previous exposure have been resolved or have reached\n\nthe end of available appeal processes, and other parts have been appealed. Following these developments, which did not impact the Consolidated statement of income significantly, the maximum exposure regarding the gas liquid pricing remains at an estimated USD 71 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\n## Other claims\n\nDuring the normal course of its business, Equinor is involved in legal proceedings, and several other unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset, in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Equinor has provided in its Consolidated financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on its best estimate. Equinor does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially a/ffected by the resolution of these legal proceedings. Equinor is actively pursuing the above disputes through the contractual and legal means available in each case, but the timing of the ultimate resolutions and related cash flows, if any, cannot at present be determined with su/fficient reliability.\n\nProvisions related to claims other than those related to income tax are reflected within note 23 Provisions and other liabilities. Uncertain income tax related liabilities are reflected as current tax payables or deferred tax liabilities as appropriate, while uncertain tax assets are reflected as current or deferred tax assets.",

        "page_content": "## Note 27. Related parties\n\n## Transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nThe Norwegian State is the majority shareholder of Equinor and also holds major investments in other Norwegian companies. As of 31 December 2022, the Norwegian State had an ownership interest in Equinor of 67.0% (excluding Folketrygdfondet, the Norwegian national insurance fund, of 3.4%). This ownership structure means that Equinor participates in transactions with many parties that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party. The responsibility for the Norwegian State's shareholding in Equinor was transferred from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy to the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 2022.\n\nTotal purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian State amounted to USD 12,617 million, USD 9,572 million and USD 5,108 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These purchases of oil and natural gas liquids are recorded in Equinor ASA. In addition, Equinor ASA sells in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's gas production. These transactions are presented net. For further information please see note 7 Total revenues and other income. The most significant items included in the line-item Payables to equity accounted associated companies and other\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nrelated parties in note 24 Trade and other payables, are amounts payable to the Norwegian State for these purchases.\n\nThe line-item Prepayments and Financial Receivables includes USD 1,461 million which represent a gross receivable from the Norwegian state under the Marketing Instruction in relation to the state's (SDFI) expected participation in the gas sales activities of a foreign subsidiary of Equinor. At year end 2021 the corresponding amount was USD 435 million. The increase is mainly related to increased volumes and higher cost price on the gas storage. A corresponding non-current liability of USD 1,461 million has been recognized, representing SDFI's estimated interest in the gas sales activities in the foreign subsidiary.\n\n## Other transactions\n\nIn its ordinary business operations Equinor enters into contracts such as pipeline transport, gas storage and processing of petroleum products, with companies in which Equinor has ownership interests. Such transactions are included within the applicable captions in the Consolidated statement of income. Gassled and certain other infrastructure assets are operated by Gassco AS, which is an entity under common control by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.\n\nGassco's activities are performed on behalf of and for the risk and reward of pipeline and terminal owners, and capacity payments flow through Gassco to the respective owners. Equinor payments that flowed through Gassco in this respect amounted to USD 1,210 million, USD 1,030 million and USD 896 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These payments are mainly recorded in Equinor ASA. The stated amounts represent Equinor's capacity payment net of Equinor's own ownership interests in Gassco operated infrastructure. In addition, Equinor ASA manages, in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's share of the Gassco costs. These transactions are presented net. Equinor has had transactions with other associated companies and joint ventures in the course of its ordinary business, for which amounts have not been disclosed due to materiality. In addition, Equinor has had transactions with joint operations and similar arrangements where Equinor is operator. Indirect operating expenses incurred as operator are charged to the joint operation or similar arrangement based on the 'no-gain/no-loss' principle.\n\nRelated party transactions with management are presented in note 8 Salaries and personnel expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Note 28. Financial instruments and fair value measurement\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset. The subsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on which category they have been classified into at inception: Financial investments at amortised cost, at fair value through profit or loss, and at fair value through other comprehensive income. The classification is based on an evaluation of the contractual terms and the business model applied.\n\nShort-term highly liquid investments with original maturity exceeding 3 months are classified as current financial investments. Current financial investments are primarily accounted for at amortised cost but also at fair value through profit or loss, depending on classification.\n\nTrade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less a provision for doubtful receivables which represent expected losses computed on a probabilityweighted basis.\n\nA part of Equinor's financial investments is managed together as an investment portfolio of Equinor's captive insurance company and is held in order to comply with specific regulations for capital retention. The investment portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an investment\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nstrategy and is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are presented as current if they contractually will expire or otherwise are expected to be recovered within 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if they are held for the purpose of being traded. Financial assets and financial liabilities are shown separately in the Consolidated balance sheet, unless Equinor has both a legal right and a demonstrable intention to net settle certain balances payable to and receivable from the same counterparty.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when rights to cash flows and risks and rewards of ownership are transferred through a sales transaction or the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, are redeemed, or cancelled. Gains and losses arising on the sale, settlement or cancellation of financial assets are recognised within Net financial items.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the liability. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities is either as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, depending on classification. The latter applies to Equinor's non-current bank loans and bonds.\n\nFinancial liabilities are presented as current if the liability is expected to be settled as part of Equinor's normal operating cycle, the liability is due to be settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date, Equinor does not have the right to defer settlement of the liability more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if the liabilities are held for the purpose of being traded.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligations are settled, or if they expire, are discharged or cancelled. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised within Net financial items.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nEquinor uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value through profit and loss. The impact of commoditybased derivative financial instruments is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as Other revenues, as such derivative instruments are related to sales contracts or revenue-related risk management for all significant purposes. The impact of other derivative financial instruments is reflected under Net financial items.\n\nDerivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Derivative assets or liabilities expected to be settled, or with the legal right to be settled more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, are classified as non-current. Derivative financial instruments held for the purpose of being traded are however always classified as current.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument are accounted for as financial instruments. However, contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Equinor's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, also referred to as own-use, are not accounted for as financial instruments. Such sales and purchases of physical commodity volumes are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income as Revenue from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation], respectively. This is applicable to a significant number of contracts for the purchase or sale of crude oil and natural gas, which are recognised upon delivery.\n\nFor contracts to sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash, but which ultimately are physically settled despite not qualifying as own use prior to settlement, the changes in fair value are included in Gain/loss on commodity derivatives (part of Other revenues, see note 7 Total revenues and other",

When these derivatives are physically settled, the previously recognised unrealised gain/ loss is included in Physically settled commodity derivatives (also part of Other revenues). The physical deliveries made through such contracts are included in Revenue from contracts with customers at contract price.\n\nDerivatives embedded in host contracts which are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as separate derivatives and are reflected at fair value with subsequent changes through profit and loss, when their risks and economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value. Where there is an active market for a commodity or other non-financial item referenced in a purchase or sale contract, a pricing formula will, for instance, be considered to be closely related to the host purchase or sales contract if the price formula is based on the active market in question. A price formula with indexation to other markets or products will however result in the recognition of a separate derivative. Where there is no active market for the commodity or other nonfinancial item in question, Equinor assesses the characteristics of such a price related embedded derivative to be closely related to the host contract if the price formula is based on relevant indexations commonly used by other market participants. This applies to certain long-term natural gas sales agreements.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Financial instruments by category\n\nThe following tables present Equinor's classes of financial instruments and their carrying amounts by the categories as they are defined in IFRS 9 Financial\n\nInstruments. For financial investments, the di/fference between measurement as defined by IFRS 9 categories and measurement at fair value is immaterial. For trade and other receivables and payables, and cash and\n\ncash equivalents, the carrying amounts are considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Financial instruments quoted in active markets will typically include financial instruments with quoted market prices obtained from the relevant exchanges or clearing houses. The fair values of quoted financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative instruments are determined by reference to mid-market prices, at the close of business on the balance sheet date.\n\nWhere there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's-length market transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and pricing models and related internal assumptions. In the valuation techniques, Equinor also takes into consideration the counterparty and its own credit risk. This is either reflected in the discount rate used or through direct adjustments to the calculated cash flows. Consequently, where Equinor reflects elements of long-term physical delivery commodity contracts at fair value, such fair value estimates to the extent possible are based on quoted forward prices in the market and underlying indexes in the contracts, as well as assumptions of forward prices and margins where observable market prices are not available. Similarly, the fair values of interest and currency swaps are estimated based on relevant quotes from active markets, quotes of comparable instruments, and other appropriate valuation techniques.",

For Equinor this category will, in most cases, only be relevant for investments in listed equity securities and government bonds.\n\nLevel 2, fair value based on inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, which are derived from observable market transactions, includes Equinor's\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nnon-standardised contracts for which fair values are determined on the basis of price inputs from observable market transactions. This will typically be when Equinor uses forward prices on crude oil, natural gas, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as inputs to the valuation models to determine the fair value of it derivative financial instruments.\n\nLevel 3, fair value based on unobservable inputs, includes financial instruments for which fair values are determined on the basis of input and assumptions that are not from observable market transactions. The fair\n\nvalues presented in this category are mainly based on internal assumptions. The internal assumptions are only used in the absence of quoted prices from an active market or other observable price inputs for the financial instruments subject to the valuation.\n\nThe fair value of certain earn-out agreements and embedded derivative contracts are determined by the use of valuation techniques with price inputs from observable market transactions as well as internally generated price assumptions and volume profiles. The discount rate used in the valuation is a risk-free rate\n\nbased on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows adjusted for a credit premium to reflect either Equinor's credit premium, if the value is a liability, or an estimated counterparty credit premium if the value is an asset. In addition, a risk premium for risk elements not adjusted for in the cash flow may be included when applicable. The fair values of these derivative financial instruments have been classified in their entirety in the third category within current derivative financial instruments and non-current derivative financial instruments.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EQUINOR ASA\n\n## Note 1. Organisation and significant accounting policies\n\nEquinor ASA is the parent company of the Equinor Group (Equinor), consisting of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries. Equinor ASA's main activities include shareholding in group companies, group management, corporate functions and group financing. Equinor ASA also carries out activities related to external sales of oil and gas products, purchased externally or from group companies, including related refinery and transportation activities. Reference is made to disclosure note 1 Organisation in Equinor's Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements of Equinor ASA (\"the company\") are prepared in accordance with simplified IFRS pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-9 and regulations regarding simplified application of IFRS issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 7 February 2022. The presentation currency of Equinor ASA is US dollar (USD), consistent with the presentation currency for the group financial statements and with the company's functional currency, as USD is the currency for which Equinor's operations are mainly linked to. Translation currency rates (NOK/USD) applicable for the period are as follows: 8.82 (31 Dec 2021), 9.86 (31 Dec 2022) and 9.62 (year-average).\n\nThese parent company financial statements should be read in connection with the Consolidated financial statements of Equinor, published together with these financial statements. With the exceptions described below, Equinor ASA applies the accounting policies of the group, as described in Equinor's Consolidated financial statements. Insofar that the company\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\napplies policies that are not described in the Equinor consolidated financial statements due to group level materiality considerations, such policies are included below if necessary for a su/fficient understanding of Equinor ASA's accounts.\n\n## Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures\n\nShareholdings and interests in subsidiaries and associated companies (companies in which Equinor ASA does not have control, or joint control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally when the ownership share is between 20% and 50%), as well as Equinor ASA's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in Equinor ASA's share of net assets of the entity, less distribution received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Goodwill may arise as the surplus of the cost of investment over Equinor ASA's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. Goodwill included in the balance sheets of subsidiaries and associated companies is tested for impairment as part of the related investment in the subsidiary or associated company. The Statement of income reflects Equinor ASA's share of the results after tax of an equityaccounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition in situations where Equinor\n\nASA has not been the owner since the establishment of the entity. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented as part of Total revenues and other income, as these investments in other companies engaged in energy-related business activities are considered part of Equinor ASA's main operating activities.\n\nWithin Equinor ASA's equity, a reserve for valuation variances has been established. All positive di/fferences between the equity accounted investments' carrying value and the acquisition cost is allocated to this reserve.\n\n## Expenses related to the Equinor group as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements (licences)\n\nIndirect operating expenses incurred by the company, such as personnel expenses, are accumulated in cost pools. Such expenses are allocated in part on hours incurred cost basis to Equinor Energy AS, to other group companies and to licences where Equinor Energy AS or other group companies are operators. Costs allocated in this manner reduce the expenses in the company's statement of income, with the exception of operating subleases and cost recharges related to lease liabilities being recognised gross, which are presented as revenues in Equinor ASA.\n\n## Asset transfers between the company and its subsidiaries\n\nTransfers of assets and liabilities between the company and the entities that it directly or indirectly controls are\n\naccounted for at the carrying amounts (continuity) of the assets and liabilities transferred, when the transfer is part of a reorganisation within the Equinor group.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded derivatives within sales or purchase contracts between Equinor ASA and other companies within the Equinor group are not separated from the host contract.\n\n## Dividends payable and group contributions\n\nDividends are reflected as Dividends payable within current liabilities. Group contributions for the year to other entities within Equinor's Norwegian tax group are reflected in the balance sheet as current liabilities within Liabilities to group companies. Under simplified IFRS the presentation of dividends payable and group contributions payable di/ffers from the presentation under IFRS, as it also includes dividends and group contributions payable which at the date of the balance sheet is subject to a future annual general meeting approval before distribution.\n\n## Reserves for unrealised gains\n\nReserves for unrealised gains included within the Company's equity consists of accumulated unrealised gains on non-exchange traded financial instruments and accumulated positive fair value changes from embedded derivatives.",

Financial risk management and measurement of financial instruments\n\n## General information relevant to financial risks\n\nEquinor ASA's activities expose the company to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The management of such risks does not substantially di/ffer from the Group's. See note 4 Financial risk and capital management in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of financial instruments by categories\n\nThe following tables present Equinor ASA's classes of financial instruments and their carrying amounts by the categories as they are defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. For financial investments, the di/fference between measurement as defined by IFRS 9 categories and measurement at fair value is immaterial. For trade and other receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts are considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\nSee note 21 Finance debt in the Consolidated financial statements for fair value information of non-current bonds and bank loans and note 28 Financial instruments and fair value measurement in the Consolidated financial statements where fair value measurement is explained in detail.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n| (in USD million)                                                   | Note   | Amortised cost   | Fair value through  profit or loss   | Non-financial   assets   | Total   carrying amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                                                |        |                  |                                      |                          |                           |\n| Assets                                                             |        |                  |                                      |                          |                           |\n| Non-current derivative financial instruments                       |        |                  | 95                                   |                          | 95                        |\n| Non-current financial investments                                  |        |                  | 166                                  |                          | 166                       |\n| Prepayments and financial receivables                              |        | 1,645            |                                      | 193                      | 1,838                     |\n| Receivables from subsidiaries and other equity accounted companies | 11     | 18,563           |                                      | 566                      | 19,129                    |\n| Trade and other receivables                                        | 13     | 13,963           |                                      | 227                      | 14,190                    |\n| Receivables from subsidiaries and other equity accounted companies | 11     | 26,363           |                                      | 50                       | 26,413                    |\n| Current derivative financial instruments                           |        |                  | 979                                  |                          | 979                       |\n| Current financial investments                                      | 11     | 29,466           |                                      |                          | 29,466                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                          | 14     | 7,098            | 3,106                                |                          | 10,204                    |\n| Total financial assets                                             |        | 97,098           | 4,346                                | 1,037                    | 102,481                   |\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION",

The contracts' terms vary with durations of up to 2060.\n\nTake-or-pay contracts for the purchase of commodity quantities are only included in the table below if their contractually agreed pricing is of a nature that will or\n\nmay deviate from the obtainable market prices for the commodity at the time of delivery.\n\nObligations payable by Equinor ASA to entities accounted for as associates and joint ventures are included gross in the table below. Obligations payable by Equinor ASA to entities accounted for as joint operations (for example pipelines) and where consequently Equinor's share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses (capacity costs) are reflected on a line-by-line basis in the Financial statements, are included net (i.e. gross commitment less Equinor ASA's ownership share).\n\nThe table below includes USD 867 million related to the non-lease components of lease agreements reflected in the accounts according to IFRS 16, as well as leases not yet commenced.

The fair value and book value of the guarantees are immaterial.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nEquinor ASA is the participant in certain entities (\"DAs\") in which the company has unlimited responsibility for its proportionate share of such entities' liabilities, if any, and participates in certain companies (\"ANSs\") in which the participants in addition have joint and several liabilities. For further details, see note 10 Investments in subsidiaries and other equity accounted investments.\n\n## Resolved dispute with Norwegian tax authorities related to Equinor Service Center Belgium N.V.\n\nIn 2020, Equinor received a decision from the Norwegian tax authorities related to the capital structure of the subsidiary Equinor Service Center Belgium N.V., concluding that the capital structure had\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nto be based on the arm length's principle, a/ffecting the fiscal years 2012 to 2016.

The major part of intercompany revenues is attributed to sales of crude oil and sales of refined products to Equinor Marketing and Trading Inc, USD 2,541 million and USD 1,708 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively and Equinor Refining Denmark A/S, no transactions and USD 2,523 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nEquinor ASA sells natural gas and pipeline transport on a back-to-back basis to Equinor Energy AS. Similarly, Equinor ASA enters into certain financial contracts, also on a back-to-back basis with Equinor Energy AS. All of the risks related to these transactions are carried by\n\nEquinor Energy AS and the transactions are therefore not reflected in Equinor ASA's financial statements.\n\nEquinor ASA buys volumes from its subsidiaries and sells them into the market.

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Board statement on corporate governance\n\nThis chapter provides a detailed overview of how Equinor follows the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (the Code of Practice). The Code of Practice covers 15 topics, and this board statement covers each of these topics and describes Equinor's adherence to the Code of Practice. Information that Equinor must provide in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act Section 3-3b is also included. The statement describes the foundation and principles for Equinor's corporate governance structure. The statement should be seen in context with information on corporate governance in section 1.8 Governance and risk management. Further information can be found on www.equinor.com.\n\nThe deviations from the Code of Practice for corporate governance follow below.\n\n## 6. General meetings\n\nThe Code of Practice recommends that the board of directors and chair of the nomination committee be present at the general meetings. Equinor has not deemed it necessary to require the presence of all members of the board of directors. However, the chair of the board, the chair of the nomination committee, the chair of the corporate assembly, external auditor, the CEO and other members of management are always present at general meetings.\n\n## 14. Take-overs\n\nThe Code of Practice recommends that the board establish guiding principles for how it will act in the\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nevent of a take-over bid. The board has not established such guidelines, due to Equinor's ownership structure. In the event of a bid as discussed in section 14 of the Code of Practice, the board of directors will, in addition to complying with relevant legislation and regulations, seek to comply with the recommendations in the Code of Practice. The board has no other explicit basic principles or written guidelines for procedures to be followed in the event of a take-over bid. The board of directors otherwise concurs with what is stated in the Code of Practice regarding this issue.\n\n## 1. Implementation and reporting\n\nEquinor ASA is a Norwegian-registered public limited liability company with its primary listing on Oslo B\u00f8rs, and the foundation for the Equinor group's governance structure is Norwegian law. American Depositary Receipts (ADR) representing ordinary shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and we are subject to the listing requirements of NYSE and the applicable reporting requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC rules).\n\nThe following principles underline Equinor's approach to corporate governance:\n\n- \u00b7 All shareholders will be treated equally.\n- \u00b7 Equinor will ensure that all shareholders have access to up-to-date, reliable and relevant information about its activities.\n- \u00b7 Equinor will have a board of directors that is independent (as defined by Norwegian standards)\n\nof the group's management. The board focuses on preventing conflicts of interest between shareholders, the board of directors and the company's management.\n\n- \u00b7 The board of directors will base its work on the principles for good corporate governance.\n\nThe governance and management system is further elaborated on our website at www.equinor.com/cg where shareholders and stakeholders can explore any topic of interest in more detail.\n\n## Compliance with NYSE listing rules\n\nEquinor's primary listing is on the Oslo B\u00f8rs, and its ADRs are listed on the NYSE. In addition, Equinor is a foreign private issuer subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC rules.\n\nADRs represent the company's ordinary shares listed on the NYSE. While Equinor's corporate governance practices follow the requirements of Norwegian law, Equinor is also subject to the NYSE's listing rules.\n\nAs a foreign private issuer, Equinor is exempted from most of the NYSE corporate governance standards that domestic US companies must comply with. However, Equinor is required to disclose any significant deviations from corporate governance practices applicable to domestic US companies under the NYSE rules. This is disclosed in the annual report on Form 20-F as filed to SEC and published on www.equinor.com/reports.\n\n## 2. Business\n\nEquinor is an international energy company headquartered in Stavanger, Norway. The company has business operations in around 30 countries and approximately 22,000 employees worldwide. Equinor ASA is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Norway and subject to the provisions of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The Norwegian State is the largest shareholder in Equinor ASA, with a direct ownership interest of 67%.\n\n## Objective, strategies and risk profiles\n\nEquinor's objective is defined in the articles of association section 1 and is to develop, produce and market various forms of energy and derived products and services, as well as other business. The activities may also be carried out through participation in or cooperation with other companies. Equinor's current articles of association were adopted at the annual general meeting of shareholders on 11 May 2022 and are available at www.equinor.com/articlesofassociation.\n\nEquinor's purpose is turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society. The board has approved a corporate strategy to deliver on this purpose and the strategy has been translated into concrete objectives and targets to align execution.\n\nAt Equinor, the way we deliver is as important as what we deliver.

        "page_content": "Equinor employees, sets the standards for behaviour, delivery and leadership.\n\nOur Code of Conduct is further described in subsection 10. Risk management and internal control in this chapter.\n\nWe also focus on managing the impacts of our activities on people, society and the environment, in line with corporate policies for health, safety, security, sustainability and climate, including human rights and ethics. These e/fforts and policies are further described in section 2.1 Always safe as well as section 2.3 Low carbon.\n\n## 3. Equity and dividends\n\n## Shareholders' equity and capital structure\n\nThe board of directors considers the equity and capital structure of Equinor as at 31 December 2022 to be satisfactory given the company's requirements for financial robustness in relation to its expressed goals, strategy and risk profile. Further information on the equity and capital structure can be found in sections 1.6 Capital and liquidity management, 2.2 High value and the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nAny increase of the company's share capital must be mandated by the general meeting. If a mandate was to be granted to the board of directors to increase the company's share capital, such mandate would be restricted to a defined purpose. If the general meeting is to consider mandates to the board of directors for the issue of shares for di/fferent purposes, each mandate would be considered separately by the general meeting.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nIt is Equinor's ambition to grow the annual cash dividend, measured in USD per share, in line with longterm underlying earnings. Equinor announces dividends on a quarterly basis. The board approves first to third quarter interim dividends based on an authorisation from the general meeting, while the annual general meeting approves the fourth quarter (and total annual) dividend based on a proposal from the board. When deciding the interim dividends and recommending the total annual dividend level, the board will take into consideration expected cash flow, capital expenditure plans, financing requirements and appropriate financial flexibility. In addition to cash dividends, Equinor might buy-back shares as part of the distribution of capital to the shareholders.\n\nThe shareholders at the annual general meeting may vote to reduce, but may not vote to increase, the fourth quarter dividend proposed by the board of directors.\n\nEquinor declares dividends in USD. Dividends in NOK per share will be calculated and communicated four business days after record date for shareholders at Oslo B\u00f8rs.\n\nThe dividend proposed by board of directors to the annual general meeting for the fourth quarter is noted in section 2.2 High value - Group Analysis.\n\n## Buy-back of own shares for subsequent annulment\n\nIn addition to cash dividend, Equinor may buy-back shares as part of the total distribution of capital to the shareholders. To buy-back shares the board of directors will need an authorisation from the general\n\nmeeting. The annual general meeting authorised on 11 May 2022, the board of directors to acquire Equinor ASA shares in the market, on behalf of the company, with a nominal value of up to NOK 187,500,000. The board of directors is authorised to decide at what price within minimum and maximum prices of NOK 50 and NOK 1,000, respectively, and at what time such acquisition shall take place. Shares acquired pursuant to this authorisation can only be used for annulment through a reduction of the company's share capital, pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act section 12-1. It is also a precondition for the repurchase and the annulment of shares that the Norwegian State's ownership interest in Equinor ASA is not changed.\n\n## Purchase of own shares for use in the share savings plan\n\nSince 2004, Equinor has had a share savings plan for its employees. The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the business culture and encourage loyalty through employees becoming part-owners of the company. The annual general meeting annually authorises the board of directors to acquire Equinor ASA shares in the market in order to continue implementation of the employees share savings plan.\n\n## 4. Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associates\n\nEqual treatment of all shareholders is a core governance principle in Equinor. Equinor has one class of shares, and each share confers one vote at the general meeting. The articles of association contain no restrictions on voting rights and all shares have equal rights.\n\n## The Norwegian State as majority owner\n\nThe Norwegian State (the State) is the majority shareholder of Equinor and also holds major investments in other Norwegian companies. As of 31 December 2022, the State had an ownership interest in Equinor of 67% (excluding Folketrygdfondet's (Norwegian national insurance fund) ownership interest of 3.39%). The State is also a majority owner in other companies or enterprises that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party. Equinor may participate in transactions with such companies or enterprises. All such transactions are always entered into on an arm's length basis. The State's ownership interest in Equinor is managed by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (MTIF) The State's ownership interests in related parties may be managed by the MTIF or other Ministries in the Norwegian government, depending on the line of business such related parties are engaged in.\n\nContact between the State as owner and Equinor takes in principle place in the same manner as for other institutional investors, however, with the di/fference that there are more frequent meetings with the MTIF. Topics discussed includes Equinor's economic and strategic development, sustainability and the State's expectations regarding results and returns on investments. Such meetings comply with Norwegian company and securities legislation, hereunder equal treatment of shareholders and limitations for discussing inside information.\n\nIn all matters in which the State acts in its capacity as shareholder, exchanges with the company are based on information that is available to all shareholders.

The State will be subject to general rules that apply to the handling of such information. Equinor ensures that, in any interaction between the State and Equinor, a distinction is drawn between the State's di/fferent roles.\n\nThe State has no appointed board members or members of the corporate assembly in Equinor. As majority shareholder, the State has appointed a member of Equinor's nomination committee.\n\n## Sale of the State's oil and gas\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, Equinor markets and sells the State's share of oil and gas production from the NCS together with its own production. The State has a common ownership strategy aimed at maximising the total value of its ownership interests in Equinor and its own oil and gas interests. This strategy is incorporated in the Owner's Instruction, which obliges Equinor, in its activities on the NCS, to emphasise these overall interests in decisions that may be of significance to the implementation of the sales arrangements.\n\nThe State-owned company Petoro AS handles commercial matters relating to the State's direct involvement in petroleum activities on the NCS and related activities and is responsible for overseeing that Equinor performs its tasks in accordance with the Owner's Instruction.\n\n## Other transactions\n\nIn relation to its ordinary business operations such\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nas pipeline transport, gas storage and processing of petroleum products, Equinor also has regular transactions with certain entities in which Equinor has ownership interests. Such transactions are carried out on an arm's length basis.\n\n## 5. Freely negotiable shares\n\nEquinor's primary listing is on Oslo B\u00f8rs. ADRs are traded on the NYSE. Each Equinor ADR represents one underlying ordinary share.\n\nThe articles of association of Equinor do not include any form of restrictions on the ownership, negotiability or voting related to its shares and the ADRs.\n\n## 6. General meeting of shareholders\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders is Equinor's supreme corporate body. It serves as a democratic and e/ffective forum for interaction between the company's shareholders, board of directors and management.\n\nThe next annual general meeting (AGM) is scheduled for 10 May 2023. At Equinor's AGM on 11 May 2022, 77.87 % of the share capital was represented either by personal attendance, by proxy or by advance voting.\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the AGM must be held by the end of June each year. Notice of the meeting and documents relating to the AGM are published on Equinor's website and notice is sent to all shareholders with known addresses at least 21 days prior to the meeting. All shareholders who are registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) will receive a notice to the AGM.\n\nOther documents relating to Equinor's AGMs will be made available on Equinor's website. A shareholder may request that these documents be sent to him/her.\n\nShareholders are entitled to have their proposals considered at the AGM if the proposal has been submitted in writing to the board of directors in su/fficient time to enable it to be included in the notice of meeting, i.e. no later than 28 days before the meeting.\n\nAs described in the notice of the general meeting, shareholders may vote in writing, including through electronic communication, during a specified period before the general meeting.\n\nThe AGM is normally opened and chaired by the chair of the corporate assembly. If there is a dispute concerning individual matters and the chair of the corporate assembly belongs to one of the disputing parties or is for some other reason not perceived as being impartial, another person will be appointed to chair the AGM. This is in order to ensure impartiality in relation to the matters to be considered.\n\nThe following matters are decided at the AGM:\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the board of directors' report, the financial statements and any dividend proposed by the board of directors and recommended by the corporate assembly.\n- \u00b7 Election of the shareholders' representatives to the corporate assembly and approval of the corporate assembly's fees.\n- \u00b7 Election of the nomination committee and approval of the nomination committee's fees.\n- \u00b7 Election of the external auditor and approval of the auditor's fee.\n- \u00b7 Any other matters listed in the notice convening the AGM.\n\nThe general meeting votes for each candidate nominated for election to the company's corporate assembly and nomination committee.\n\nAll shares carry an equal right to vote at general meetings. Resolutions at general meetings are normally passed by simple majority. However, Norwegian company law requires a qualified majority for certain resolutions, including resolutions to waive preferential rights in connection with any share issue, approval of a merger or demerger, amendment of the articles of association or authorisation to increase or reduce the share capital. Such matters require approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast as well as two-thirds of the share capital represented at the general meeting.\n\nIf shares are registered by a nominee in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS), cf. section 4-10 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, and the beneficial shareholder wants to vote such shares, the beneficial shareholder must re-register the shares in a separate VPS account in such beneficial shareholder's own name prior to the general meeting. If the holder can prove that such steps have been taken and that the holder has a de facto shareholder interest in the company, the company will allow the shareholder to vote the shares. Decisions regarding voting rights for shareholders and proxy holders are made by the person opening the meeting, whose decisions may be reversed by the general meeting by simple majority vote.\n\nThe minutes of the AGM are made available on Equinor's website immediately after the AGM.",

Nomination committee\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the nomination committee shall consist of four members who are shareholders or representatives of shareholders. The duties of the nomination committee are set forth in the articles of association, and the instructions for the committee are adopted by the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nThe nomination committee seeks to ensure that the shareholders' views are taken into consideration when candidates to the governing bodies of Equinor ASA are proposed. The nomination committee invites Equinor's largest shareholders to propose shareholder-elected candidates of the board of directors and the corporate assembly, as well as members of the nomination committee. The shareholders are also invited to provide input to the nomination committee in respect of the composition and competence of Equinor's governing bodies considering Equinor's strategy and challenges and opportunities going forward. The deadline for providing input is normally set to early/mid-January so that such input may be taken into account in the upcoming nominations. In addition, all shareholders have an opportunity to submit proposals through an electronic mailbox as described on Equinor's website. The results from an annual board evaluation are made available to the nomination committee for the board nomination process. Separate meetings are held between the nomination committee and each board member, including employee-elected board members. The chair of the board and the chief executive o/fficer\n\nare invited, without having the right to vote, to attend at least one meeting of the nomination committee before it makes its final recommendations. The committee regularly utilises external expertise in its work and provides reasons for its recommendations of candidates.\n\nWhen it comes to the subject of diversity and inclusion for the composition of the board of directors and the corporate assembly, it is stated in the instructions for the nomination committee section 3.5 that 'Emphasis will also be given to ensuring reasonable representation in terms of gender and background, and to the independence of members of the board of directors and corporate assembly in relation to the company. The company's guidelines on diversity and inclusion are described in section 2.1.4 Tackling inequality - Diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe members of the nomination committee are elected by the annual general meeting. The chair of the nomination committee and one other member are elected from among the shareholder-elected members of the corporate assembly. Members of the nomination committee are normally elected for a term of two years.\n\nEquinor's nomination committee consists of the following members as of 31 December 2022 and are elected for the period up to the annual general meeting in 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 Jarle Roth (chair), CEO of Umoe Group 9 (also chair of Equinor's corporate assembly)\n- \u00b7 Jan Tore F\u00f8sund, Director General at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Merete Hverven, CEO of Visma (also a member of Equinor's corporate assembly)\n- \u00b7 Berit L. Henriksen, independent advisor\n\nThe board considers all members of the nomination committee to be independent of Equinor's management and board of directors.\n\nThe nomination committee held 16 ordinary meetings in 2022.\n\nThe instructions for the nomination committee are available at www.equinor.com/nominationcommittee.\n\n## 8. Corporate assembly, board of directors and management\n\n## Corporate assembly\n\nPursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, companies with more than 200 employees must elect a corporate assembly unless otherwise agreed between the company and a majority of its employees.\n\nThe corporate assembly consists of 18 members, and the chair and deputy chair are elected by and among its members.\n\nMembers of the corporate assembly are normally elected for a term of two years. Members of the board of directors and management cannot be members of the corporate assembly, but they are entitled to attend and to speak at meetings unless the corporate\n\nassembly decides otherwise in individual cases. Members of the corporate assembly do not have service contracts with the company or its subsidiaries providing for benefits upon termination of o/ffice.\n\nAn overview of the members and observers of the corporate assembly as of 31 December 2022 follows.\n\nA total list of members and deputy members, as well as the procedure for the work of the corporate assembly, can be found at www.equinor.com/corporateassembly.\n\nThe duties of the corporate assembly are defined in section 6-37 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act.\n\nEquinor's corporate assembly held four ordinary meetings in 2022. The chair of the board and the CEO participated in all four meetings.\n\n## Board of directors\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the board of directors shall consist of between 9 and 11 members elected by the corporate assembly. The chair and the deputy chair of the board are also elected by the corporate assembly. At present, Equinor's board of directors consists of 11 members.

        "page_content": "The employee-elected board members, but not the shareholder-elected board members, have three deputy members who attend board meetings in the event an employee-elected member of the board is unable to attend. The management is not represented on the board of directors. Members of the board are elected for a term of up to two years, normally for one year at a time. There are no board member service contracts that provide for benefits upon termination of o/ffice.\n\nThe board considers its composition to be competent with respect to the expertise, capacity and diversity appropriate to attend to the company's strategy, goals, main challenges, and the common interest of all shareholders. The board members have experience from oil, gas, renewables, shipping, telecom, Norwegian defence forces and environmental and sustainability work. The board also deems its composition to consist of individuals who are willing and able to work as a team, resulting in an e/fficient and collegiate board. At least one board member qualifies as an \"audit committee financial expert\", as defined in the SEC rules. The board has determined that, in its judgment, all the shareholder-elected on the board are considered independent. In making its determinations of independence, the board focuses inter alia on there not being any conflicts of interest between shareholders, the board of directors and the company's management. Seven board members are men, four board members are women and three board members are nonNorwegians with residence outside of Norway.\n\nThere were changes to the composition of the board of directors after the election in the corporate assembly meeting in June where Michael D. Lewis was elected and replaced Jeroen van der Veer with e/ffect from\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n1 July 2022, and in the corporate assembly meeting in November where Haakon Bruun-Hanssen was elected and replaced Bj\u00f8rn Tore Godal with e/ffect from 12 December 2022.\n\nEquinor ASA has purchased and maintains a Directors and O/fficers Liability Insurance on behalf of the members of the board of directors and the CEO. The insurance also covers any employee acting in a managerial capacity and includes controlled subsidiaries. The insurance policy is issued by a reputable insurer with an appropriate rating.\n\nThe board held eight ordinary board meetings and four extraordinary meetings in 2022. Average attendance at these board meetings was 99.17%.\n\nFurther information about the members of the board and its committees is included in chapter 1.8 Governance and risk management and is available on www.equinor.com/board.\n\n## 9. The work of the board of directors\n\nThe board is responsible for managing the Equinor group and for monitoring day-to-day management and the group's business activities. The board has established control systems to ensure that Equinor operates in compliance with laws and regulations, with the values as stated in the Equinor Book and the Code of Conduct, as well as in accordance with the owners' expectations of good corporate governance.\n\nThe board handles matters of major importance, or of an extraordinary nature, and may require the management to present other matters. An important\n\ntask of the board is to appoint the chief executive o/fficer (CEO) and to stipulate their job instructions, and terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe board has adopted a generic annual plan for its work which is revised with regular intervals. Recurring items on the board's annual plan include safety, security, sustainability and climate, corporate strategy, business plans, targets, quarterly and annual results, annual reporting, ethics, management's monthly performance reporting, management compensation issues, CEO and top management leadership assessment and succession planning, project status review, people and organisation priorities, main risks and an annual review of the board's governing documentation.\n\nClimate-related upside and downside risks, and Equinor's strategic response to these are also discussed frequently by the board. In 2022, the board discussed climate change and the energy transition in all of the ordinary board meetings either as integral parts of strategy and investment discussions or as separate topics.\n\nAn induction programme with key members of the management is arranged for new board members. They receive an introduction to Equinor's business and relevant information about the company and the board's work.\n\nThe board conducts an annual self-evaluation of its own work and competence, which is externally facilitated. In the annual board evaluation for 2022, climate change capabilities and knowledge were included as key components. The evaluation report is discussed in a board meeting and is made available to the nomination committee and also discussed in\n\na meeting between the chair of the board and the nomination committee as input to the committee's work.\n\n## Requirements for board members\n\nThe work of the board is based on rules of procedure that describe the board's responsibilities, duties and administrative procedures. They also describe the CEO's duties vis-\u00e0-vis the board of directors.\n\nThe board's rules of procedure are available on our website at www.equinor.com/board.\n\n## The board of directors' committees\n\nEquinor's board has established three committees: the audit committee; the compensation and executive development committee; and the safety, sustainability and ethics committee. The committees prepare items for consideration by the board and their authority is limited to making recommendations.\n\n## Audit committee\n\nThe audit committee assists the board in exercising its oversight responsibilities in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial reporting process and the integrity of the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 The company's internal control, internal audit and risk management systems and practices.\n- \u00b7 The recommendation of election of external auditor and qualifications, independence and oversight of the work of the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Business integrity, including handling of complaints and reports.\n- \u00b7 Other duties as set out in the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act \u00a7 6-43 and Regulation 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act and applicable listing requirements.",

In addition, the board of directors has concluded that Anne Drinkwater, Rebekka Glasser Herlofsen, Jonathan Lewis and Finn Bj\u00f8rn Ruyter are independent within the meaning of the requirements in the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act.\n\nThe committee held six regular meetings in 2022, in addition to two deep dive sessions and attendance was 96.67%.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the objective and duties of the committee, see the instructions available\n\n- at www.equinor.com/auditcommittee.\n\n## Compensation and executive development committee\n\nCompensation and executive development committee\n\nThe main responsibilities of the compensation and executive development committee are:\n\n- \u00b7 To make recommendations to the board in all matters relating to principles and the framework for executive rewards, remuneration strategies and concepts, the CEO's contract and terms of employment, and leadership development, assessments and succession planning.\n- \u00b7 To be informed about and advise the company's management in its work on Equinor's remuneration strategy for senior executives and in drawing\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- up appropriate remuneration policies for senior executives.\n- \u00b7 To review Equinor's remuneration policies in order to safeguard the owners' long-term interests.\n\nThe committee held six meetings in 2022 and attendance was 88.89%.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the objective and duties of the committee, see the instructions available\n\n- at www.equinor.com/compensationcommittee.\n\n## Safety, sustainability and ethics committee\n\nThe safety, sustainability and ethics committee assists the board in reviewing the practices and performance of the company primarily in matters regarding safety, security, ethics, sustainability and climate. This includes quarterly reviews of the company's risks related to matters covered by the committee, practices and performance, including climate-related risks and performance.\n\nThe committee held four meetings and one extraordinary meeting in 2022 and attendance was 100%.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the objective and duties of the committee, see the instructions available\n\n- at www.equinor.com/ssecommittee.\n\n## 10. Risk management and internal control\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe board of directors oversees the company's internal control and overall risk management and assurance, and through its audit committee, reviews\n\nand monitors the e/ffectiveness of the company's policies and practices in such regard. On an ongoing basis, the board and board audit committee discuss the company's enterprise risk management framework and three-lines of control model and learning from risk-adjusting actions and assurance activities. The board, board audit committee and board safety, sustainability and ethics committee, together, monitor and assess risks including legal, regulatory, financial, safety, security, sustainability and climate-related risks and the associated control measures put in place to manage them. Twice a year, the board receives and reviews an assessment of all top enterprise risks, material emerging risks and risk-issues, and discusses the company's risk profile.\n\nEquinor manages risk to ensure that operations and other business activities are conducted in a safe and secure manner, in compliance with external and internal standards and requirements, so that unwanted incidents are avoided, and maximum value is created. The company's enterprise risk management framework endeavours to make risk considerations an integral part of realising its purpose and vision, and of driving dayto-day performance.\n\nThrough its three lines of control model, companywide accountabilities for risk management, and responsibilities for risk analysis, monitoring, advising and assurance are defined across all relevant classes of risk, including business integrity risks (fraud, sanctions, competition, money laundering), safety/ security/sustainability risks, financial/legal/regulatory risks, people risks and political/public a/ffairs risks. Procedures and systems are in place to assess both potential financial impacts of risks on cash-flows and\n\npotential non-financial impacts of risks on people, the environment, physical assets, and ultimately, the company's reputation. Where necessary, operational risks are insured by the company's captive insurance company, that operates in both Norwegian and international insurance markets.\n\nFurther information about the risks and risk factors that the company's financial and operating results are subject to are presented in section 1.8 Governance and risk management and section 5.2 Risk factors.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nEquinor's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed, under the supervision of the chief executive o/fficer and chief financial o/fficer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Equinor's financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nEquinor's internal control over financial reporting framework is based on COSO 2013 Internal Controls Integrated Framework. The framework is governed by Equinor's management system and implemented through a top-down, risk-based approach across all relevant functions and business areas within the company.\n\nEquinor has established a global function (the ICoFR function), which is responsible for governing Equinor's internal control over financial reporting on behalf of the CFO. The ICoFR function manages Equinor's annual process for internal control over financial reporting and provides support and expertise to the organization to secure an e/ffective and continuously",

The annual process includes formalized processes for scoping and risk assessment; control design improvement and maintenance; assurance of control design and operating e/ffectiveness; deficiency management and evaluations; communications, training and stakeholder reporting. Key assurance activities include independent verification testing of controls; quarterly self-assessments and management sign-o/ffs; as well as internal audits conducted by Equinor's corporate audit function.\n\nEquinor's disclosure committee assists the CEO and CFO in assessing the status of internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis and reviewing Equinor's public filings and disclosures, including its consolidated financial statements and non-financial disclosures, to ensure that the contents of Equinor's results announcements, the Integrated annual report, and the Annual report on Form 20-F appropriately reflect the non-financial and financial position and results of the company.\n\nThe board has delegated authority to the board audit committee to assist it in overseeing the e/ffectiveness of Equinor's internal control over financial reporting. The board audit committee reviews and discusses quarterly updates from management on the status of key financial reporting risks, control assurance activities and remediation of identified deficiencies, and internal control improvement initiatives. The board audit committee also reviews management's evaluation of the e/ffectiveness of Equinor's internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (included in the annual report on Form 20-F as filed with SEC and published on www.equinor.com/reports) and updates the board on\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthe status of compliance and any significant issues that warrant the attention of the board.\n\n## Code of Conduct Ethics - Equinor's approach\n\nEquinor believes that responsible and ethical behaviour is a necessary condition for a sustainable business. Equinor's Code of Conduct is based on its values and reflects Equinor's commitment to high ethical standards in all its activities.\n\n## Our Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct describes Equinor's code of business practice and the requirements for expected behaviour. The Code of Conduct applies to Equinor's board members, employees and hired personnel. It is divided into five main categories: The Equinor way, Respecting our people, Conducting our operations, Relating to our business partners and Communities and environment.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is approved by the board of directors.\n\nEquinor seeks to work with others who share its commitment to ethics and compliance, and Equinor manages its risks through in-depth knowledge of suppliers, business partners and markets. Equinor expects its suppliers and business partners to comply with applicable laws, respect internationally recognised human rights and adhere to ethical standards which are consistent with Equinor's ethical requirements when working for or together with Equinor. In joint ventures and entities where Equinor does not have control, Equinor makes good faith e/fforts to encourage the adoption of ethics and anti-corruption policies and\n\nprocedures that are consistent with its standards. Equinor will not tolerate any breaches of the Code of Conduct. Remedial measures may include termination of employment and reporting to relevant authorities.\n\nMore information about Equinor's policies and requirements related to the Code of Conduct and Equinor's approach to integrity and anticorruption is available in section 2.2.4 Integrity and anti-corruption and on www.equinor.com/about-us/ethics-and-compliance.\n\n## 11. Remuneration to the board of directors and corporate assembly\n\nReference is made to section 1.8 Governance and risk management.\n\n## 12. Remuneration to the corporate executive committee\n\nReference is made to section 1.8 Governance and risk management.\n\n## 13. Information and communications\n\nEquinor has established guidelines for the company's reporting of financial and other information and the purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that timely and correct information about the company is made available to our shareholders and society in general.\n\nA financial calendar and shareholder information is published at www.equinor.com/calendar.\n\nInvestor relations is responsible for distributing and registering information in accordance with the\n\nlegislation and regulations that apply where Equinor securities are listed. Investor relations reports directly to the chief financial o/fficer.\n\nThe company's quarterly presentations are broadcasted live on our website. Investor relations communicate with present and potential shareholders through presentations, one-to-one meetings, conferences, website, financial media, telephone, mail and e-mail contact. The related reports as well as other relevant information are available at www.equinor.com/investor where all information distributed to the company's shareholders is published at the same time as it is sent.\n\n## 14. Take-overs\n\nThe board of directors endorses the principles concerning equal treatment of all shareholders and Equinor's articles of association do not set limits on share acquisitions. Equinor has no defence mechanisms against take-over bids in its articles of association, nor has it implemented other measures that limit the opportunity to acquire shares in the company. The Norwegian State owns 67% of the shares, and the marketability of these shares is subject to parliamentary decree.\n\n## 15. External auditor\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm (external auditor) is independent in relation to Equinor and is appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young AS, has been engaged to provide an audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board",

        "page_content": "(United States). Ernst & Young AS will also issue a report in accordance with law, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), which includes opinions on the Consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of Equinor ASA. The reports are set out in section 5.7 Statements on this report incl. independent auditor reports.\n\nThe external auditor's fee must be approved by the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nPursuant to the instructions for the board's audit committee approved by the board of directors, the audit committee is responsible for ensuring that the company is subject to an independent and e/ffective external and internal audit. Every year, the external auditor presents a plan to the audit committee for the execution of the external auditor's work. The external auditor attends the meeting of the board that deals with the preparation of the annual accounts.\n\nThe external auditor also participates in meetings of the audit committee. The audit committee considers all reports from the external auditor before they are considered by the board. The audit committee will meet as often as it deems necessary, and normally five to seven times a year. Both the board and the board's audit committee hold meetings with the internal auditor and the external auditor on a regular basis without the company's management being present.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates and makes a recommendation to the board, the corporate assembly and the general meeting of shareholders regarding\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nthe choice of external auditor. The committee is responsible for ensuring that the external auditor meets the requirements in Norway and in the countries where Equinor is listed. The external auditor is subject to the provisions of US securities legislation, which stipulates that a responsible partner may not lead the engagement for more than five consecutive years.\n\nWhen evaluating the external auditor, emphasis is placed on the firm's qualifications, expertise, resources, objectivity, independence and the auditor's fee within the context of the standards required by applicable law, regulation and listing requirements.\n\n## The audit committee's policies and procedures for pre-approval\n\nIn its instructions for the audit committee, the board has delegated authority to the audit committee to preapprove assignments to be performed by the external auditor. Within this pre-approval, the audit committee has issued further guidelines. The audit committee has issued guidelines for the management's pre-approval of assignments to be performed by the external auditor.\n\nAll audit-related and other services provided by the external auditor must be pre-approved by the audit committee. Provided that the types of services proposed are permissible under SEC guidelines and Norwegian Auditors Act requirements, pre-approval is usually granted at a regular audit committee meeting. The chair of the audit committee has been authorised to pre-approve services that are in accordance with policies established by the audit committee that specify in detail the types of services that qualify. It is a condition that any services pre-approved in this manner are presented to the full audit committee at its\n\nnext meeting. Some pre-approvals can therefore be granted by the chair of the audit committee if an urgent reply is deemed necessary.\n\n## Remuneration of the external auditor in 2020 2022\n\nIn the annual Consolidated financial statements and in the parent company's financial statements, the independent auditor's remuneration is split between the audit fee and the fee for audit-related, tax and other services. The breakdown between the audit fee and the fee for audit related, tax and other services is presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders.\n\nReference is made to the table in note 9 Auditor's remuneration and Research and development expenditures in the Consolidated financial statements showing the aggregate fees related to professional services rendered by Equinor's external auditor Ernst & Young AS, for the fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022. All fees included in this table have been approved by the board's audit committee.\n\nAudit fee is defined as the fee for standard audit work that must be performed every year in order to issue an opinion on Equinor's Consolidated financial statements, on Equinor's internal control over annual reporting and to issue reports on the statutory financial statements. It also includes other audit services, which are services that only the independent auditor can reasonably provide, such as the auditing of non-recurring transactions and the application of new accounting policies, audits of significant and newly implemented system controls and limited reviews of quarterly financial results.\n\nAudit-related fees include other assurance and related services provided by auditors, but not limited to those that can only reasonably be provided by the external auditor who signs the audit report, that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the company's financial statements, such as acquisition due diligence, audits of pension and benefit plans, consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\n\nTax and Other services fees include services, if any, provided by the auditors within the framework of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, i.e., certain agreed procedures.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2 Risk factors\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Prices and markets\n\nFluctuating prices of oil and natural gas as well as exchange rates and general macroeconomic outlook impact our financial performance. Generally, Equinor does not have control over the factors that a/ffect market development and prices.\n\nUncertainty in global and regional energy supply and demand means that Equinor's long-term plans should take into consideration a large outcome space for how global energy markets may develop. Examples of factors that can a/ffect supply and demand, and consequently prices of oil, natural gas, electricity and other energy products include: global and regional economic conditions, political and regulatory developments, geopolitical tensions, actions of OPEC+ and other large energy suppliers, the social and health situation in any country or region, technological advances, availability of energy resources or access to energy related acreages, development of supply chains and consumer preferences, including those related to climate issues.\n\nOver the past years there has been significant volatility in energy prices, triggered by the supply and demand impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the postpandemic recovery, the European security situation, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and its e/ffect on global energy flows.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEnergy prices and predominantly oil and natural gas prices are the primary drivers of Equinor's business results, financial condition and liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures. A significant or prolonged period of low prices could lead to changes in production, impairment of assets or reassessment of the viability of projects under development and future business opportunities.\n\nIncreases in prices can lead to increased taxes, cost inflation or higher access costs for Equinor.\n\nFluctuating foreign exchange rates, especially between USD, EUR, GBP and NOK, can have a significant impact on Equinor's operational and financial results. A large percentage of Equinor's revenues and cash receipts are denominated in or driven by USD, sales of gas and refined products are mainly denominated in EUR and GBP, while a large portion of operating expenses, capital expenditures and income taxes payable accrue in NOK. The majority of Equinor's long-term debt has USD exposure. See also the description of market risk (including commodity price risk and currency risk) in Note 4 Financial risk and capital management in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Hydrocarbon resource base and low carbon opportunities\n\nChanges to Equinor's hydrocarbon resource base estimates and ability to access low carbon opportunities can impact future production, revenues and expenditures as well as delivery of our strategy.\n\nOur estimates relating to current and future energy resources depend on many factors, variables and assumptions that are beyond Equinor's control, and which may prove to be incorrect over time. The reliability of resource estimates depends on the quality and quantity of Equinor's geological, technical and economic data together with extensive engineering judgements. Substantial upward or downward revisions in Equinor's resources outlook may be required should additional information become available after the initial estimates were prepared. A substantial downward revision could potentially lead to impairments.\n\nEquinor's future oil and gas resource base depends on timely success to access, acquire and develop attractive opportunities. If unsuccessful, future production will decline and future revenue will be reduced. Equinor's access to resources is impacted by the choices of governments and, outside of Norway, national oil and gas companies. Changes in fiscal terms and fluctuations in oil and gas prices will have a direct impact on Equinor's resource base. Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated based on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements and may di/ffer substantially from Equinor's view on expected reserves and contingent resources.\n\nEquinor's ability to build material low carbon (both renewable and decarbonisation) business portfolios depends on access to attractive opportunities where the right commercial terms are key. Future conditions along with risks and uncertainties in power, hydrogen\n\nand carbon markets as well as internal factors will influence our ability to achieve our ambitions relating to renewable energy resources and low carbon business.\n\n## Climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, market and technology developments, including stakeholder sentiment, related to the issue of climate change, can a/ffect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nShifts in stakeholder focus between energy security, a/ffordability and sustainability add uncertainty to delivery and outcomes associated with Equinor's strategy.\n\nStricter climate laws, regulations and policies as well as adverse litigation outcomes could adversely impact Equinor's financial results and outlook, including the value of its assets. This might be directly through regulatory towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels, changes in taxation, increased costs, access to opportunities, or indirectly through changes in consumer behaviour or technology developments.\n\nEquinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today. Equinor applies a default minimum carbon price in investment analysis starting at 58 USD per tonne in 2022, increasing towards 100 USD per tonne by 2030. In countries where the actual or predicted carbon price is higher",

        "page_content": "than our default at any point in time, Equinor applies the actual or expected cost, such as in Norway where both a CO 2 tax and the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) apply. A higher carbon price provides incentive to reduce emissions and increase investment in new low carbon solutions and technology.\n\nChanging demand for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, and innovation and technology changes supporting their cost-competitive development, represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor.\n\nMarket development and our ability to reduce costs and capitalise on technology improvements are important but unpredictable risk factors. Multiple factors in the energy transition contribute to uncertainty in future energy price assumptions, and changes in investor and societal sentiment can a/ffect our access to capital markets, attractiveness for investors, and potentially restrict access to finance or increase financing costs.\n\nStrong competition for assets, changing levels of policy support, and di/fferent commercial/contractual models may lead to diminishing returns within the renewable and low carbon industries and hinder Equinor ambitions. These investments may be exposed to interest rate risk and inflation risk.\n\nEquinor's net zero strategy and climate related ambitions are responses to challenges and opportunities in the energy transition. There is no assurance that these ambitions will be achieved or that the method associated with the ambitions will be accepted by all stakeholders. Successful strategy execution depends on development of\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nnew technologies, new value chains, societal shifts in consumer demands, as well as firm leadership from policy makers. Should societal demands, technological innovation and policy support from governments not shift in parallel with Equinor's pursuit of significant greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy transition investments, Equinor's ability to meet its climate ambitions will be impaired.\n\n## International politics and geopolitical change\n\nPolitical, economic, and social developments or instability in regions where Equinor has interests and may seek future opportunities could adversely a/ffect Equinor's business causing financial loss.\n\nPolitical instability, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war, sanctions and trade disputes, public health situations (including Covid-19), adverse and hostile actions against Equinor's sta/ff, its facilities, its transportation systems and its digital infrastructure (cyberattacks) may disrupt or curtail Equinor's operations and business opportunities. These may in turn lead to a decline in production and otherwise adversely a/ffect Equinor's business, operations, results and financial condition. Similarly, Equinor's response to such situations could lead to claims from partners and relevant stakeholders, litigation, and litigation-related costs.\n\nIn 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Equinor exited all projects in Russia and announced an impairment of USD 1.08 billion on the balance sheet as of 31 March 2022. The European security situation will continue to impact our business environment volatility, uncertainty and complexity for the foreseeable future, including through impacts related to oil and gas supply\n\nand demand; policy response, supply chains and security.\n\n## Digital and cyber security\n\nIncreasing digitization and reliance on information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) mean that failure to manage digital and cyber threats could materially disrupt Equinor's operations and financial condition.\n\nDigital and cyber security threats such as unauthorized access or attacks by hackers, computer viruses, breaches due to unauthorised use, errors or malfeasance by employees or others who have gained access to Equinor networks and systems, and insider threats to our assets, could result in loss of production, loss of sensitive or private information, and other safety and environmental losses. The company could face associated regulatory actions, legal liability, reputational damage, and loss of revenue if any such threat materializes.\n\nEquinor could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.\n\nSee also section 2.1.1 Safe and secure operations Performance disclosure - Security incidents.\n\n## Project delivery and operations\n\nUncertainties in development projects and production operations in the Equinor portfolio could prevent Equinor from realising profits and cause substantial losses.\n\nOil and gas, renewable, low carbon and other projects or assets may be curtailed, delayed, cancelled or suspended for many reasons. Situations such as equipment shortages or failures, natural hazards, unexpected drilling conditions or reservoir characteristics, irregularities in geological formations, challenging soil conditions, accidents, mechanical and technical di/fficulties, power cost and availability, protestor actions, health issues (including COVID-19), new technology implementation and quality issues might have significant impact. The risk is higher in new and challenging areas such as deep waters or other harsh environments, and in new value chains.\n\nEquinor's portfolio of development projects includes a high number of major development-projects as well as 'first-o/ff' projects (i.e. involving new development concepts, operating regions, execution models, partners/contractors, value chains and markets) that increase portfolio complexity and potentially execution risk.\n\nEquinor's ability to commercially exploit energy resources and carbon products depends, among other factors, on availability of adequate capacity of transportation and/or transmission infrastructure to markets at a commercial price. Equinor may be unsuccessful in its e/fforts to secure commercially viable transportation, transmission and markets for all its potential production in a cost-e/fficient manner or at all.\n\n## Joint arrangement and contractors\n\nThe actions of our partners, contractors and subcontractors could result in legal liability and financial loss for Equinor.",

        "page_content": "Many of Equinor's activities are conducted through joint arrangements and with contractors and subcontractors which may limit Equinor's influence and control over the performance of such operations. If operators, partners or contractors fail to fulfil their responsibilities, Equinor can be exposed to financial, operational, safety, security and compliance risks as well as reputational risks and risks related to ethics, integrity and sustainability.\n\nEquinor is also exposed to enforcement actions by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident in an operation where it does not exercise operational control. Operators, partners and contractors may be unable or unwilling to compensate Equinor against costs incurred on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement.\n\n## Competition and technological innovation\n\nIf competitors move faster or in other directions related to the development and deployment of new technologies and products, Equinor's financial performance and ability to deliver on our strategy may be adversely a/ffected.\n\nEquinor could be adversely a/ffected if we do not remain commercially and technologically competitive to e/fficiently develop and operate an attractive portfolio of assets, to obtain access to new opportunities, and to keep pace with deployment of new technologies and products that can impact our transition to a broad energy company.\n\nEquinor's financial performance may be negatively impacted by competition from players with stronger financial resources or with increased agility and flexibility, and from an increasing number of companies applying new business models.\n\n## Ownership and action by the Norwegian State\n\nThe interests of Equinor's majority shareholder, the Norwegian State, may not always be aligned with the interests of Equinor's other shareholders and can impact Equinor's strategy, ambitions and financial performance.\n\nFailure of Equinor to deliver on broad societal, governmental and political expectations could impact how the Norwegian State exercises its ownership of the company and its decisions relating to the NCS.\n\nThe Norwegian State directly held 67% of Equinor's ordinary shares as of 31 December 2022 and has the power to influence the outcome of any vote of shareholders, including amending its articles of association and electing all non-employee members of the corporate assembly. Factors influencing the voting of the Norwegian State could be di/fferent from the interests of Equinor's other shareholders.\n\nThe responsibility to exercise the Norwegian State's ownership in Equinor is held by MTIF. MTIF's exercise of ownership can be subject to scrutiny by the Norwegian Parliament. In 2021, the Auditor-General expressed expectations with respect to the ministry's follow-up of\n\nEquinor's financial reporting, risk, profitability and return in Equinor's international portfolio.\n\nThe Norwegian State has resolved that its shares in Equinor and the SDFI's interest in NCS licences must be managed in accordance with a coordinated ownership strategy for the Norwegian State's oil and gas interests. Under this strategy, the Norwegian State has required Equinor to market the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with Equinor's own oil and gas as a single economic unit and to take account of the Norwegian State's interests in all decisions that may a/ffect the marketing of these resources. If the Norwegian State's coordinated ownership strategy is not adequately implemented, then Equinor's mandate to sell the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with its own oil and gas is likely to be prejudiced which could have an adverse e/ffect on Equinor's position in the markets in which it operates 10 .\n\n## Policies and legislation\n\nEquinor's operations in various countries are subject to dynamic legal and regulatory factors that could impact our business plans and financial performance.\n\nEquinor operates in countries which lack wellfunctioning and reliable legal systems, where the enforcement of contractual rights is uncertain, and where the governmental, fiscal and regulatory regimes can change over time or can be subject to unexpected or rapid change. Such changes could constrain our plans, cause operational delays, increase costs of\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nregulatory compliance, increase litigation risk, impact sale of our products, require us to divest or curtail operations, limit access to new opportunities, and a/ffect provisions for pension, tax and legal liabilities.\n\nChanges in the tax laws of the countries in which Equinor operates could have a material adverse e/ffect on liquidity and results of operations.\n\nEquinor's exploration and production activities undertaken together with national oil companies are subject to a significant degree of state control. In recent years, governments and national oil companies have in some regions exercised greater authority and imposed more stringent conditions on energy companies. Intervention by governments can take a variety of forms, such as nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, non-renewal, restriction or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights. Equinor could be subject to imposition of new contractual obligations, price and exchange controls, tax or royalty increases, payment delays, and currency and capital transfer restrictions.\n\nEquinor's US operations use hydraulic fracturing, which is subject to a range of federal, state and local laws. Various US states and local governments have implemented, or are considering, changes to regulations or increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing that could adversely a/ffect Equinor's US onshore business and the demand for its fracturing services.",

Such occurrences could have a materially adverse e/ffect on Equinor's operations and opportunities, liquidity and financial performance.\n\n## Finance\n\nEquinor's business is exposed to liquidity, interest rate, equity and credit risks that could adversely a/ffect the results of Equinor's operations, our financial position and ability to operate, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Trading and commercial supply activities\n\nEquinor's trading and commercial supply activities in the physical markets can lead to financial losses.\n\nEquinor uses financial instruments such as futures, options, over-the-counter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for di/fferences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to manage price di/fferences and volatility.

Uncertainties related to the future of the oil and gas industry and the rate of growth of new value chains, the need for new capabilities, and increased competition for talent, pose a risk to securing the right level of workforce competence and capacity through industry cycles.\n\nFurther, company restructuring and Equinor's changes to its operating model to meet the needs of the oil and gas, renewable and low carbon domains may not deliver on expectations.\n\n## Crisis management, business continuity and insurance coverage\n\nEquinor's crisis management and business continuity systems may prove inadequate and disrupt our business causing losses. Equinor's insurance coverage\n\nmay not provide adequate protection from losses, with a potential material adverse e/ffect on Equinor's financial position.\n\nOur business could be severely a/ffected if Equinor does not respond or is perceived not to have prepared, prevented, responded, or recovered in an e/ffective and appropriate manner to a crisis or major incident. A crisis or disruption might occur as a result of a security or cyber security incident or if a risk described under 'Security, safety and environmental risks' materialises.\n\nEquinor maintains insurance cover that includes coverage for physical damage to its properties, thirdparty liability, workers' compensation and employers' liability, general liability, sudden pollution, and other coverage. Equinor's insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery and is subject to caps, exclusions, and limitations. There is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect Equinor against liability from all potential consequences and damages as illustrated by financial loss for the group related to the fire at Hammerfest LNG in 2020.\n\nThe Equinor group retains parts of its insurable risks in a wholly owned captive insurance company, so insurance recovery outside of the Equinor group may be limited.\n\n## Security, safety and environmental risks\n\n## Health, safety and environmental factors\n\nEquinor is exposed to a wide range of risk factors that could result in harm to people, the environment, and our assets, as well as cause significant losses through\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\nbusiness interruption, increased costs, regulatory action, legal liability, and damage our licence to operate.\n\nRisk factors that could lead to impacts on health, safety and the environment include human performance, operational failures, breach of digital security, detrimental substances, subsurface conditions (including conditions related to hydraulic fracturing), technical integrity failures, vessel collisions, natural disasters, adverse weather or climatic conditions, physical e/ffects of climate change (see section 2.2.2 Profitable Portfolio), epidemics or pandemics (including COVID 19), breach of human rights, structural and organizational changes and other occurrences. Continuation, resurgence or emergence of a pandemic, could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this report and materially impact Equinor's operations and financial condition.\n\nThese risk factors could result in disruptions of our operations and could, among other things, lead to blowouts, structural collapses, loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, fires, explosions and water contamination that cause harm to people, loss of life or environmental damage. All modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are susceptible to a loss of containment of hydrocarbons and other hazardous materials and represent a significant risk to people and the environment. Equinor could also be subject to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of incurring substantial costs, including for remediation if any such health, safety or environmental risk materialises.",

Reviews performed by these authorities could result in changes to previously published financial statements and future accounting practices. In addition, failure of external reporting to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability and damage to Equinor's reputation.\n\nAudits of financial statements could identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in Equinor's internal control over financial reporting and cause loss of investor confidence that can potentially impact the share price.\n\n## Business integrity and ethical misconduct\n\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption and bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws, competition and antitrust laws, sanctions and trade restrictions or other\n\napplicable laws, or failure to meet Equinor's ethical requirements, could expose Equinor to legal liability, lead to a loss of business, loss of access to capital and damage our license to operate.\n\nEquinor is subject to anti-corruption and bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws in multiple jurisdictions, including the Norwegian Penal code, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. A violation of such applicable laws could expose Equinor to investigations from multiple authorities and may lead to criminal and/or civil liability with substantial fines. Incidents of noncompliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations and the Equinor Code of Conduct could be damaging to Equinor's reputation, competitive position, and shareholder value. Similarly, failure to uphold our Human Rights policy may damage our reputation and social licence to operate.\n\nEquinor has a diverse portfolio of projects worldwide and operates in markets and sectors impacted by sanctions and international trade restrictions. Sanctions and trade restrictions are complex, unpredictable and are often implemented on short notice. While Equinor remains committed to comply with sanctions and trade restrictions and takes steps to ensure, to the extent possible, compliance therewith, there can be no assurance that an Equinor entity, o/fficer, director, employee, or agent is not in violation of such sanctions and trade restrictions. Any such violation, even if minor in monetary terms, could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and could materially adversely a/ffect Equinor's business and results of operations or financial condition.\n\nEquinor is subject to competition and antitrust laws in multiple jurisdictions, including the Norwegian Competition Act, the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and the Unites States' Sherman Act, Clayton Act, HSR Act and Federal Trade Commission Act. A violation of such laws could expose Equinor to investigations from multiple authorities and may lead to criminal and/or civil liability with substantial fines. Incidents of noncompliance with applicable competition and antitrust laws and the Equinor Code of Conduct could be damaging to Equinor's reputation, competitive position, and shareholder value.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3 Shareholder information\n\n## Equinor's share savings plan\n\nSince 2004, Equinor has had a share savings plan for employees of the company. The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the business culture and encourage loyalty through employees becoming part-owners of the company.\n\nThrough regular salary deductions, employees can invest up to 5% of their base salary in Equinor shares. In addition, the company contributes 20% of the total share investment made by employees in Norway, up to a maximum of NOK 1,500 per year (approximately USD 150). This company contribution is a taxable employee benefit under 2022 Norwegian tax legislation. After a lock-in period of two calendar years, one extra share will be awarded for each share purchased. Under current Norwegian tax legislation, the share award is a taxable employee benefit, with a value equal to the value of the shares and taxed at the time of the award.\n\nThe board of directors is authorised to acquire Equinor shares in the market on behalf of the company. The authorisation is valid until 30 June 2023. This authorisation replaces the previous authorisation to acquire Equinor's own shares for implementation of the share savings plan granted by the annual general meeting 11 May 2022. It is Equinor's intention to renew this authorisation at the annual general meeting on 10 May 2023.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nFor the period 2013-2022, the board of directors has been authorised by the annual general meeting of Equinor to repurchase Equinor shares in the market for subsequent annulment. It is Equinor's intention to renew this authorisation at the annual general meeting in May 2023.\n\nThe Annual General meeting on 11 May 2022 authorised the board of directors to acquire own shares in the market. The authorisation is valid until the earlier of 30 June 2023 and the annual general meeting in 2023. 56,222,111 shares were repurchased in the market as part of the 2022 Share buyback programme at USD 1.98 billion. The share buyback programme is expected to be executed when Brent oil prices are in or above the range of 50-60 USD/bbl and Equinor's net debt ratio* stays within the communicated ambition of 15-30% and this is supported by commodity prices.\n\n## Summary of shares repurchased\n\nAll shares repurchased have been purchased in the open market and pursuant to the authorisations mentioned above. Also see note 20 Shareholders' equity and dividends to the Consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its ownership interest is managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Norwegian State had a 67% direct ownership interest in Equinor and a 3.39% indirect interest through the National Insurance Fund (Folketrygdfondet), totalling 70.4%.\n\nEquinor has one class of shares, and each share confers one vote at the general meeting. The Norwegian State does not have any voting rights that di/ffer from the rights of other ordinary shareholders. Pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the votes represented at a general meeting is required to amend our articles of\n\n## Distribution of shareholders\n\n(at year end 2022 - %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nassociation. As long as the Norwegian State owns more than one-third of our shares, it will be able to prevent any amendments to our articles of association. Since the Norwegian State, acting through the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, has in excess of two-thirds of the shares in the company, it has sole power to amend our articles of association. In addition, as majority shareholder, the Norwegian State has the power to control any decision at general meetings of our shareholders that requires a majority vote, including the election of the majority of the corporate assembly, which has the power to elect our board of directors and approve the dividend proposed by the board of directors.\n\nThe Norwegian State endorses the principles set out in \"The Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance\", and it has stated that it expects companies in which the State has ownership interests\n\n## Free float breakdown\n\n(%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto adhere to the code. The principle of ensuring equal treatment of di/fferent groups of shareholders is a key element in the State's own guidelines. In companies in which the State is a shareholder together with others, the State wishes to exercise the same rights and obligations as any other shareholder and not act in a manner that has a detrimental e/ffect on the rights or\n\nfinancial interests of other shareholders. In addition to the principle of equal treatment of shareholders, emphasis is also placed on transparency in relation to the State's ownership and on the general meeting being the correct arena for owner decisions and formal resolutions.\n\n|   Shareholders at December 2022 | Shareholders at December 2022                  | Number of Shares   | Ownership in %   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n|                               1 | Government of Norway                           | 2 127 565 006      | 67.00%           |\n|                               2 | Folketrygdfondet                               | 107 556 485        | 3.39%            |\n|                               3 | BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. 1) | 33 594 128         | 1.06%            |\n|                               4 | The Vanguard Group, Inc. 1)                    | 33 044 872         | 1.04%            |\n|                               5 | DNB Asset Management AS                        | 20 502 622         | 0.65%            |\n|                               6 | T.

        "page_content": "## 5.4 EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities\n\nEquinor has implemented the EU Taxonomy disclosure in accordance with EU Regulation 2020/852 and the Delegated Acts related to Article 8 (information to be disclosed), 10 (climate change mitigation) and 11 (climate change adaption) that require the disclosure about the environmental performance of the company's assets and economic activities. The regulation establishes the criteria to determine whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and specifies quantitative economic performance indicators to disclose the degree of sustainability. The activities defined to be eligible under the EU Taxonomy regulations are listed within the delegated acts and continue to evolve with review. The regulation has been enacted in Norwegian legislation with e/ffect for 2023. Equinor's reporting is thus a voluntary reporting.\n\nAn activity is 'Taxonomy-eligible' if it is described in the regulation, irrespective of whether it complies with the\n\ntechnical screening criteria. An activity is 'Taxonomyaligned' if it contributes substantially to one or more environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other objectives, and is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards.\n\nIn order to achieve its ambition to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050, Equinor undertakes emission reducing activities that are supporting the continued operating of oil and gas production. While these help Equinor towards its ambition, some of these activities (notably onshore electrification of o/ffshore assets) are not eligible per the EU Taxonomy regulations and therefore are not visible in our eligibility scores.\n\nEU Taxonomy regulations exclude contributions to the KPI's from activities in equity accounted investments. A large proportion of Equinor's environmentally sustainable activities are conducted through equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\naccounted investments and therefore are not evaluated in the mandatory key performance indicator (KPI) disclosure. To provide more holistic information of the environmentally sustainability activities of Equinor, a voluntary disclosure including the capex eligibility KPI for equity accounted investments has been included in the section on voluntary KPI's.\n\nEquinor performed EU Taxonomy alignment evaluations in 2022 for the significant activities in its portfolio of eligible activities. The testing covered both producing assets and assets under development.\n\nThe alignment testing in 2022 covered current investments related to electricity generation from wind power and photovoltaic technology. We also acquired some investments related to storage of electricity in the year which we have not yet been able to complete full alignment testing, but for which we expect positive contributions to our alignment KPI's in future years.\n\nAll tested eligible activities passed the substantial contribution criteria. When assessing compliance with the Do No Significant Harm criteria the following interpretations and judgments were applied:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change adaption - relevant climate related hazards have been assessed based on a risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 Circular economy - durability and recyclability have been assessed where feasible.\n- \u00b7 For DNSH criteria that reflect legal requirements under EU regulations, the technical screening criteria are considered met when the operations are conducted within normal, lawful operations, comply with emission permits, environmental impact assessments have been performed and necessary action have been taken when required.\n\nBased on the alignment testing performed the tested assets and associated activities are aligned with the technical screening criteria by year-end 2022.",

The activity consists of developing onshore renewables solar projects in Poland.\n\n## 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power\n\nThe main wind power activity included in the mandatory KPI is the development of the Hywind/Tampen floating wind farm intended to provide electricity for the Snorre and Gullfaks o/ffshore oil and gas fields. Electricity generation from wind power contributes directly to the\n\nenvironmental objectives and is not a transitional or enabling economic activity subject to the assessment of the lock-in e/ffects, even if it would provide for continuing operation of oil and gas installations. The eligibility assessment of this asset has been matured and reassessed from 2021 and based on the regulator's clarification of definition of economic activities the Hywind/Tampen project has been included in eligible activities in 2022.\n\n## 4.10 Storage of electricity.\n\nThe activity consists of storing electricity from renewable sources to return to the grid at a later time.\n\nIn addition, Equinor are engaged in several Hydrogen development activities and Underground permanent geological storage of CO 2 activities which are undergoing continued maturation. These activities have no significant e/ffect on the KPIs for 2022.\n\nAt the Mongstad refinery biofuel raw material is bought and processed together with other fossil raw materials. Based on the low proportion of biofuel in the final product blend Equinor has not included this in the eligible activities.\n\nEquinor's material eligible economic activities in 2022 primarily relate to the environmental objective 'climate change mitigation', and not the climate change adaptation objective.\n\n## Technical screening assessment\n\nEquinor has carried out the assessment process\n\nas described in the appendix below. The technical screening assessment has been conducted based on materiality and covers the activities electricity generation from wind power and electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology. The energy storage activities were acquired late in 2022 and will be subject technical screening assessment in 2023. Based on the conditions with regards to interpretation and fulfilment of the criteria described above, no material issues related to the screening assessment have been identified by year-end 2022.\n\n## Substantial contribution\n\nBy definition, electricity generation from wind power and solar makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation within the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Does no significant harm assessment\n\nElectricity generation from wind power contributes substantially to an environmental objective if it does no significant harm to climate change adaption, water and marine resources, circular economy and biodiversity. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology contributes substantially to an environmental objective if it does no significant harm to climate change adaption, circular economy and biodiversity.\n\n## Results and basis for conclusion\n\n## Climate change adaption\n\nFor 2022, Equinor has conducted a climate risk and vulnerability mapping of the eligible assets covering the climate related hazards we consider most relevant.

Equinor installations are designed with margins to tolerate a range of meteorological conditions. No significant changes in the risk perils based on the scenarios for the tested assets were detected.\n\n## Water and marine resources\n\nIn case of construction of o/ffshore wind, the activity must not hamper the achievement of good environmental status in accordance with EU regulations. Appropriate measures in accordance with the relevant criteria and methodological standards are required to prevent or mitigate impacts related to noise and energy.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessment has been conducted and the activity are conducted within normal lawful operations.\n\n## Circular economy\n\nFor the tested assets, availability of and, where feasible, use of equipment and components of high durability and recyclability which are easy to dismantle and refurbish have been assessed. The durability of the components were deemed to be in accordance with requirements at the time of the investments.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nRecycling of the components in the wind turbines blades and solar panels is currently not feasible. However, as technology is evolving the reuse and refurbishment of components is expected to increase.\n\nBased on the requirement at the time of investments and current feasibility the tested activities are deemed to be aligned with the screening criteria.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nFor electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology and electricity generation from wind power an environmental impact assessment (EIA) or screening in accordance with the EU requirements are required to document that the activity do no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives. Where an EIA has been carried out, the required mitigation and compensation measures for protecting the environment must be implemented.\n\nFor sites/operations located in or near biodiversitysensitive areas, an appropriate assessment, where applicable, must have been conducted in accordance with specific EU directives and based on its conclusions the necessary mitigation measures implemented.\n\nIn case of construction of o/ffshore wind, appropriate measures in accordance with the criteria and methodological standards set out in accordance with specific EU directives, must be taken to prevent or\n\nmitigate impacts relate to biodiversity and seabed integrity.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessment has been conducted and the activities are conducted within normal lawful operations.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nCompliance with the requirements have been determined by assessing the criteria against the four topics:\n\n- \u00b7 Human rights, including workers' rights\n- \u00b7 Bribery/Corruption\n- \u00b7 Taxation\n- \u00b7 Fair competition\n\nEquinor minimum safeguards procedures are based on the United Nations Guiding principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Mitigating actions are initiated to respond to any identified risks.\n\n## Voluntary KPIs\n\nTo provide further information on our environmentally sustainability activity Equinor has included a voluntary disclosure of the capex KPI for 2022 including contributions from equity accounted investments. These activities are conducted through both operated and non-operated joint ventures mainly outside the EU jurisdiction. The main part of the activities is related to development projects. Based on the nature of the\n\nactivities the R&D and maintenance related expenses are limited. Hence Opex is not included in the voluntary KPIs in 2022. The KPIs has been calculated on a pro rata basis corresponding to Equinor's share of capex in the joint ventures. The KPI numerator includes the eligible activities, and the denominator includes both eligible and non-eligible activity.\n\nEquinor has limited its voluntary capex KPI to eligible activities. Extensive documentation requirements and limited data availability, especially related to nonoperated joint ventures outside the EU jurisdiction, has not made it practical to complete alignment testing over the majority of the portfolio activities which are equity accounted for 2022. The technical screening process for the non-operated assets will be conducted in coordination with the operator of the equity accounted assets.\n\n## Eligible activities included in the voluntary KPI\n\nEligible activities included in the voluntary KPIs comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 4.1 Electricity generation from photovoltaic technology\n- \u00b7 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power\n- \u00b7 5.12 Underground permanent geological storage of CO\u2082\n- \u00b7 4.29 Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels",

The revenue included in the numerator and denominator in 2021 consisted of revenue included in the consolidated financial statement. Equinor has reassessed the definition in accordance with updates guidelines. Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments and other income (i.e. gain on divestment of assets) are excluded from the definition of the mandatory KPI, and not part of the revenue denominator. For Equinor the KPI denominator related to turnover will be highly impacted by changes in commodity prices.\n\nThe 2021 turnover KPIs been updated to include revenue for contracts with customers as described above. The total updated 2021 turnover KPI is 0% which is the same as reported in 2021.\n\n## Capex\n\nTotal capital expenditures consist of additions to property, plant and equipment including right of use assets line item as specified in note 12 Property, plant and equipment and additions to intangible assets as specified in note 13 Intangible assets to the Consolidated financial statements. Additions excludes additions and subsequent changes in estimated asset retirement obligations based on policy interpretation of the delegated act.

Capitalised exploration and acquisition costs of oil and gas prospects related to exploration are recognised as intangible assets, and by interpretation of the Taxonomy regulation, considered to be included the KPI denominator, as this is a part of Equinor's ongoing activity (see assessment below). Goodwill acquired through business combinations is excluded from the capital expenditure KPI.\n\nThe 2021 capex KPIs been updated to include capex related to the Hywind/Tampen project in the denominator and excluding ARO additions in the denominator. The total updated 2021 capex KPI is 2% which is the same as reported in 2021.\n\n## Opex\n\nTotal operating expenditures under the Taxonomy cover direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the\n\nday-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and e/ffective functioning of such assets.\n\nThe operating expenditures included in the numerator and denominator in 2021 were considered to be represented by the reported amounts included in the operating expenses and selling general and administration expense line items in the Consolidated financial statements. Equinor has reassessed the opex definition in accordance with updates from the regulators and industry practice. Per the above description the 'other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property' has been narrowed in scope to only include direct maintenance related expenses. This results in the operating expenditures in 2022 consisting of a subset of the operating expenditures in the income statement and does not include any selling, general and administrative expenditures, depreciation, amortisation, impairment and exploration expenses.\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\nThe opex denominator and numerator have been updated in accordance with the narrow definition as described below. There were no opex related to the eligible activities in 2021, hence the updated opex KPI for 2021 has been changed from 2% to 0%.\n\n## Application of the KPIs\n\nThe definition of the capex KPI includes intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. Acquired goodwill and capitalised costs according to the successful e/fforts method under IFRS 6 is out of the scope of IAS 38. The rationale for excluding IFRS 6 from the capex KPI is not clearly stated in the Taxonomy regulation. Equinor regards exploration activities as part of the ongoing core activities and has included capitalised exploration costs in the capex denominator. The exploration costs are not covered by the EU Taxonomy opex definition and not included in the opex KPI. Capitalised exploration expenditures do not have significant e/ffect on the reported capex KPIs for the year-end 2022.\n\nThe denominators are calculated based on reported IFRS numbers in the Consolidated financial statements. For Equinor this has the e/ffect that the proceeds from the sale of the Norwegian State's (SDFI) oil production on the NCS, that Equinor markets and sells on their behalf (see note 27 Related Parties to the Consolidated financial statements), that is reported on gross basis and recognised as revenue in the income statement, will have a negative impact on the reported KPI related to taxonomy-eligible and aligned revenue. Total purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian state amounted to USD 13 billion in 2022 and USD 10 billion in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 5.6 Additional sustainability information\n\n## 5.6.1 About the sustainability elements of the report\n\n## Reporting standards\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2016, core option). The sustainability report should be read in conjunction with the GRI index available at equinor.com, to get an overview of the full extent of the report. We view this report to be our Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact (advanced reporting level). We also use reporting guidance from IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, and recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n## Assurance\n\nWe recognise that the quality of our reported sustainability data can be a/ffected by inherent limitations in accuracy in raw data, calculation and estimation procedures including assumptions for such purposes, and in manual transfer of data. We strive to achieve data quality in line with expectations set out in GRI 101 'Reporting principles' and continue our work to improve internal reporting and control processes in line with the COSO framework for internal control. These processes are laid out in our internal performance framework. Examples of our internal assurance\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nmechanisms are independent internal audits and verifications, quarterly reviews of the data at business area and corporate level, and an annual process where all reported sustainability data are reviewed by named individuals and their relevant leaders confirm, in documented form, that quality assurance has been performed. This report has been externally assured by EY, with reasonable level of assurance for selected climate, environment and safety indicators, and a limited level of assurance for the rest of the report, excluding forward looking information and field-specific reporting. The independent assurance statement, as listed in appendix, concludes that the report is presented in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.\n\n## Reporting boundaries\n\nDefining consistent boundaries for sustainability reporting is challenging due to the complexity of ownership and operational arrangements, such as joint operating agreements. We strive to be consistent and transparent about variations in boundaries and provide a complete report in line with industry practice.\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental data is, unless otherwise stated, reported on a 100% basis for our operated assets, facilities and vessels, including subsidiaries and operations where we are the technical service provider, and for contracted drilling rigs and flotels ('operational control basis').\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions and upstream CO\u2082 intensity are reported both on an operational control basis and on equity basis (financial ownership interest).\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported on the basis of equity (products sold). Maritime emissions are reported from maritime vessels under Equinor contract, including project and supply vessels, drilling rigs, and tankers transporting both Equinor and third-party volumes.\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 emissions related to business travel is for Equinor employees only.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety incident data is reported for our operated assets, facilities and vessels, including subsidiaries and operations where we are the technical service provider. These include contracted drilling rigs, flotels, vessels, projects and modifications, and transportation of personnel and products, using a risk-based approach.\n- \u00b7 Economic and energy production data are reported on an equity basis, unless otherwise stated.\n- \u00b7 Workforce data covers employees in our direct employment. Temporary employees are not included.\n- \u00b7 Human rights data is collected from operated and non-operated assets.\n\nOperations acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the period in which we owned them, unless otherwise stated. Entities that we do not control, but have significant influence over, are included in the form of disclosures of management approach. The report does not include data from equity interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfields/projects, such as joint ventures, where we are not operator. Exceptions are for climate data or where specified.\n\n## Restatements\n\nHistoric numbers are sometimes adjusted due to for example changes in reporting principles, changes of calculation factors used by authorities, or reclassification of incidents after investigations. We restate historic numbers and explain the changes if the adjustment represents a change of minimum 5% for indicators with reasonable level of assurance, and 10% for indicators with limited level of assurance.",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements\n\n## Basis for the key audit matter\n\nAs described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the e/ffects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to some of the economic assumptions in the Company's estimation of future cash flows. Climate considerations are included directly in the impairment and deferred tax asset assessments by estimating the CO\u2082 costs in the cash flows, and indirectly as the expected e/ffects of the climate change are included in the estimated commodity prices. Commodity price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing and deferred tax asset assessments are based on management's best estimate, which di/ffers from the priceset required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement as described in the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook's Announced Pledges Scenario, or the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.\n\nThe impact of the energy transition and potential restrictions by regulators and market and strategic considerations may also have an e/ffect on the estimated production profiles and the economic lifetime of the Company's assets and projects. In addition, if the Company's business cases for the oil and gas producing assets in the future should change materially due to governmental initiatives to limit climate changes, it could a/ffect the timing of cessation of the assets and the asset retirement obligations.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in such estimate are commodity prices and CO\u2082 costs.\n\nWe consider the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements to be a key audit matter given the significance of this matter and the complexity and uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions used by management.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Company's process for evaluating the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions commodity price and CO2 costs.\n\nWith the support of our firm's experts in climate change and energy transition, we evaluated management's assessment of the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements. Our audit procedures among other comprised the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future commodity price assumptions and compared those with external benchmarks\n- \u00b7 We analysed the carbon price assumptions included in the cash flows for impairment and deferred tax asset assessments, by comparing them with current legislation in place in the relevant jurisdictions and the jurisdictions' announced pledges regarding escalation of CO2 costs\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's sensitivity analyses over the possible e/ffects of using the commodity prices and carbon cost assumptions in accordance with the Net Zero Emission by 2050 Scenario and Announced Pledges Scenario estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA)\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's sensitivity analyses over asset retirement obligations, including the e/ffect of performing removal five years earlier than scheduled.",

Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 11, deferred tax assets are recognised based on the expectation that su/fficient taxable income will be available through reversal of taxable temporary di/fferences or future taxable income. The future taxable income has to be considered probable based on business forecasts.\n\nIn addition to agreeing the historical losses to supporting documentation, auditing management's estimate of the amount of the deferred tax asset is subjective because the estimation requires significant judgement, including the timing of reversals of the deferred tax liability and the availability of future profits against which tax deductions represented by the deferred tax asset can be o/ffset. In addition, auditing management's estimate of amount of the deferred tax balances that are supported by the expectation of future taxable profits requires a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in future taxable profits are commodity prices, expected oil and gas reserves and capital expenditures.\n\nThese significant assumptions are forward-looking and are heightened in complexity given the future demand and price uncertainty due to climate change and the energy transition. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nWe consider the recognition of the deferred tax asset related to the US filing jurisdiction to be a key audit matter given the significance of the account on the balance sheet and the complexity and uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions used by management in the estimation of future taxable profits.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of controls over the Company's process for the recognition of the deferred tax asset related to the US filing jurisdiction. This included testing controls over the Company's process for tracking tax loss carry-forwards, management's review of assumptions and inputs to the calculations of future taxable profit and scheduling of reversal of the deferred tax liabilities.\n\nIn assessing the recognition and measurement of the deferred taxes we tested the completeness and accuracy of the amounts recognised as deferred tax asset by verifying tax loss carry-forwards against historical tax filings and assessing management's determination of the expected timing of utilisation of the deferred tax asset, including the application of relevant tax laws to the utilisation of tax losses. We also evaluated management's forecasted timing of the reversal of taxable temporary di/fferences by considering the nature of the temporary di/fferences and the relevant tax law. We involved our US tax specialists to assist us in these procedures.\n\nOur audit procedures performed over the significant assumptions and inputs included, among others, evaluation of the methods and models used in the calculation of future taxable profit. We compared projected capital expenditures, from which depreciation expense is derived, and expected reserve volumes used in the estimation of the future taxable profit to approved operator budgets or management forecasts, and also compared expected reserve volumes to external evaluations when available. In addition, we compared the forecast to that used in other areas of analysis, such as impairment or impairment reversal assessment, as applicable.\n\nTo test price assumptions, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future commodity prices and compared such assumptions to external benchmarks, among other procedures. We evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future commodity prices and carbon costs assumptions. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nWe assessed management's sensitivity analysis disclosed in Note 11 related to a reasonably possible change in commodity prices.",

Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 14, determining the recoverable amount of an asset involves an estimate of future cash flows, which is dependent upon management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the asset's useful life. The asset's operational performance and external factors have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows and therefore, the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the recoverable amount of production plants and oil and gas assets is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in forecasting future cash flows are future commodity prices, currency exchange rates, expected reserves, capital expenditures, and the discount rate.\n\nThese significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be a/ffected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, the treatment of tax in the estimation of the recoverable amount is challenging, as the Company is subject to di/fferent tax structures that are inherently complex, particularly in Norway.\n\nWe consider the determination of the recoverable amounts of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development to be a key audit matter given the significance of the accounts on the balance sheet and the complexity and uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions used by management in the cash flow models.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of controls over the Company's process for evaluating the recoverability of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development. This included testing controls over management's review of assumptions and inputs to the assessments of impairment and impairment reversals.\n\nOur audit procedures performed over the significant assumptions and inputs included, among others, evaluation of the methods and models used in the calculation of the recoverable amount. We also evaluated the relevant tax e/ffects based on the local legislation of the relevant jurisdictions, particularly in Norway, and tested the clerical accuracy of the models through independently recalculating the value in use. We involved valuation specialists to assist us with these procedures. In addition, we compared projected capital expenditures to approved operator budgets or management forecasts and compared expected reserve volumes to internal production forecasts and external evaluations of expected reserves, in accordance with the Company's internal procedures. For those assets previously impaired, we compared actual results to the forecasts used in historical impairment analyses. We also involved reserves specialists to assist us with these procedures.\n\nTo test price assumptions, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future commodity prices and compared such assumptions to external benchmarks, among other procedures. We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company's assessment of currency exchange rates and the discount rate, by assessing the Company's methodologies and key assumptions used to calculate the rates and by comparing those rates with external information.\n\nWe also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future commodity prices and carbon costs assumptions.

Refer to Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures. As described in Note 23, the appropriate estimates for such obligations are based on historical knowledge combined with knowledge of ongoing technological developments, expectations about future regulatory and technological development and involve the application of judgement and an inherent risk of significant adjustments. The estimated costs of decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering relevant risks and uncertainties.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the decommissioning and removal of o/ffshore installations at the end of the production period is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Determining the provision for such obligation involves application of considerable judgement related to the assumptions used in the estimate, the inherent complexity and uncertainty in estimating future costs, and the limited historical experience against which to benchmark estimates of future costs. Significant assumptions used in the estimate are the discount rates and the expected future costs, which include the underlying assumptions norms and rates and time required to decommission and can vary considerably depending on the expected removal complexity.\n\nThese significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be a/ffected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. For more detail, please refer to the key audit matter related to the Impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements.\n\nWe consider the estimation of the asset retirement obligations (ARO) to be a key audit matter given the significance of the related accounts to the financial statements and the complexity and uncertainty of the assumptions used in the estimate.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the present value of the estimated future decommissioning and removal expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. This includes controls related to management's review of assumptions described above, used in the calculation of the ARO.\n\nTo test management's estimation of the provision for decommissioning and removal activities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the completeness of the provision by comparing significant additions to property, plant and equipment to management's assessment of new ARO obligations recognized in the period.\n\nTo assess the expected future costs, among other procedures, we compared day rates for rigs, marine operations and heavy lift vessels to external market data or existing contracts. For time required to decommission, we compared the assumptions against historical data on a sample basis. We compared discount rates to external market data. With the support of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology and models used by management to estimate the ARO and performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions. In addition, we recalculated the formulas in the models.\n\nWe also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of the timing of cessation of the assets and the asset retirement obligations.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirement\n\n## Report on compliance with regulation on European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\n## Opinion\n\nAs part of the audit of the financial statements of Equinor ASA we have performed an assurance engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements included in the annual report, with the file name eqnr20221231NO.zip, have been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) and regulation pursuant to Section 5-5 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements, included in the annual report, have been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the annual report in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.

We conduct our work in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'. The standard requires us to plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements included in the annual report have been prepared in accordance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nAs part of our work, we perform procedures to obtain an understanding of the company's processes for preparing the financial statements in accordance with the ESEF Regulation. We test whether the financial statements are presented in XHTML-format. We evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements and assess management's use of judgement. Our procedures include reconciliation of the iXBRL tagged data with the audited financial statements in human-readable format.

The Criteria can be accessed at globalreporting.org and Equinor Sustainability Data Hub and are available to the public. Such Criteria were specifically designed for companies and other organizations that want to report their sustainability impacts in a consistent and credible way. As a result, the information may not be suitable for another purpose.\n\n## Equinor ASA's responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Directors and management are responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the Subject Matters in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Subject Matters, such that they are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## EY's responsibilities - limited assurance engagement\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter for limited assurance based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000 (Revised)'). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter for limited assurance is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.

Our firm applies ISQC 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements , and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Description of procedures performed\n\nThis engagement is designed to express a) limited assurance on the Subject Matter for limited assurance and b) reasonable assurance on the Subject Matter for reasonable assurance.\n\nThe GHG quantification process used in preparing the reporting is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs, including CO\u2082 and CH4. Additionally, GHG emissions are subject to estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the calculation process used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge. Our verification of these disclosures relates to the criteria for estimation set by local authorities.",

        "page_content": "## 5.8 Use and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\n\nSince 2007, Equinor has been preparing its audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. IFRS has been applied consistently to all periods presented in the 2022 Consolidated financial statements.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles: (i.e, IFRS in the case of Equinor). The following financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n- a)  Net debt to capital employed ratio, Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities and Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted\n- b) Return on average capital employed (ROACE)\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- c) Organic capital expenditures\n- d)  Free cashflow\n- e) Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax\n- f) Total shareholder return (TSR)\n- g)  Gross capital expenditure (gross capex)\n\n## a) Net debt to capital employed ratio\n\nIn Equinor's view, net debt ratio provides a more informative picture of Equinor's financial strength than gross interest-bearing financial debt. Three di/fferent net debt ratios are provided below; 1) net debt to capital employed ratio, 2) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities, and 3) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted.\n\nThe calculation is based on gross interest-bearing financial debt in the balance sheet and excludes cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments. Certain adjustments are made, e.g. collateral deposits\n\nclassified as cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated balance sheet are considered non-cash in the non-GAAP calculations. The financial investments held in Equinor Insurance AS are excluded in the nonGAAP calculations as they are deemed restricted. These two adjustments increase net debt and give a more prudent definition of the net debt to capital employed ratio than if the IFRS based definition was to be used. Following implementation of IFRS16 Equinor presents a 'net debt to capital employed adjusted' excluding lease liabilities from the gross interestbearing debt. Net interest-bearing debt adjusted for these items is included in the average capital employed. The table on the next page reconciles the net interestbearing debt adjusted, the capital employed and the net debt to capital employed adjusted ratio with the most directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.",

        "page_content": "## b) Return on average capital employed (ROACE)\n\nROACE is defined as adjusted earnings after tax divided by average capital employed adjusted. For a reconciliation for adjusted earnings after tax, see e) later in this section. Average capital employed adjusted at 31 December 2022 is calculated as the average of the capital employed adjusted at 31 December 2022 and at 31 December 2021 as presented in the table Calculation of capital employed and net debt to capital employed ratio section a).\n\nEquinor uses ROACE to measure the return on capital employed adjusted, regardless of whether the financing is through equity or debt. This measure provides useful\n\ninformation for both the group and investors about performance during the period under evaluation. The use of ROACE should not be viewed as an alternative to income before financial items, income taxes and minority interest, or to net income, which are measures calculated in accordance with IFRS or ratios based on these figures.\n\nForward-looking ROACE included in this report is not reconcilable to its most directly comparable IFRS measure without unreasonable e/fforts, because the amounts excluded from IFRS measures used to determine ROACE cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.\n\n| Calculated ROACE based on IFRS                                 |         | 31 December   | 31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in USD million, except percentages)                           |         | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Net income/(loss)                                              | A       | 28,744        | 8,576         |\n| Average total equity                                           | 1       | 46,506        | 36,458        |\n| Average current finance debt and lease liabilities             |         | 6,001         | 6,081         |\n| Average non-current finance debt and lease liabilities         |         | 28,202        | 31,096        |\n| - Average cash and cash equivalents                            |         | (14,853)      | (10,442)      |\n| - Average current financial investments                        |         | (25,561)      | (16,555)      |\n| Average net-interest bearing debt                              | 2       | (6,210)       | 10,180        |\n| Average capital employed                                       | B = 1+2 | 40,296        | 46,638        |\n| Calculated ROACE based on Net income/loss and capital employed | A/B     | 71.3 %        | 18.4 %        |\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\n| Calculated ROACE based on Adjusted earnings after tax and capital employed adjusted   |     | 31 December   | 31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|---------------|---------------|\n| (in USD million, except percentages)                                                  |     | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Adjusted earnings after tax                                                           | A   | 22,691        | 10,042        |\n| Average capital employed adjusted                                                     | B   | 41,134        | 44,153        |\n| Calculated ROACE based on Adjusted earnings after   tax and capital employed adjusted | A/B | 55.2%         | 22.7%         |\n\n## c) Organic capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures, defined as Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments in note 5 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements, amounted to USD 10.0 billion in 2022.\n\nOrganic capital expenditures are capital expenditures excluding acquisitions, recognised lease assets (RoU assets) and other investments with significant di/fferent cash flow patterns. Organic capital expenditure is a measure which Equinor believes gives relevant information about Equinor's investments in maintenance and development of the company's assets.\n\nIn 2022, a total of USD 1.9 billion was excluded in the organic capital expenditures. Among items excluded were additions of Right of Use (RoU) assets related to leases and acquisition of Triton Power in UK, certain Statfjord licence shares and US based battery storage developer East Point Energy, resulting in organic capital expenditure of USD 8.1 billion.\n\nIn 2021, a total of USD 0.4 billion was excluded in the organic capital expenditures. Among items excluded\n\nwere acquisition of 100% interest in Polish onshore renewables developer Wento and additions of Right of Use (RoU) assets related to leases, resulting in organic capital expenditure of USD 8.1 billion.\n\n## d) Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow represents, and is used by management to evaluate, cash generated from operational and investing activities available for debt servicing and distribution to shareholders. However, free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported in this report. Our definition of free cash flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Free cash flow to Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and working capital items, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with IFRS, as of the dates indicated:",

Management considers adjusted earnings to be a supplemental measure to\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nEquinor's IFRS measures, which provides an indication of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the period and facilitates an alternative understanding of operational trends between the periods. Adjusted earnings include adjusted revenues and other income, adjusted purchases, adjusted operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, adjusted depreciation expenses and adjusted exploration expenses. Adjusted earnings adjusts for the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value of derivatives: Certain gas contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives, required to be carried at fair value. Also, certain transactions related to historical divestments include contingent consideration, are carried at fair value. The accounting impacts of changes in fair value of\n\nthe aforementioned are excluded from adjusted earnings. In addition, adjustments are also made for changes in the unrealised fair value of derivatives related to some natural gas trading contracts. Due to the nature of these gas sales contracts, these are classified as financial derivatives to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Unrealised gains and losses on these contracts reflect the value of the di/fference between current market gas prices and the actual prices to be realised under the gas sales contracts. Only realised gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in adjusted earnings. This presentation best reflects the underlying performance of the business as it replaces the e/ffect of temporary timing di/fferences associated with the re-measurements of the derivatives to fair value at the balance sheet date with actual realised gains and losses for the period\n\n- \u00b7 Periodisation of inventory hedging e/ffect: Commercial storage is hedged in the paper market and is accounted for using the lower of cost or market price. If market prices increase above cost price, the inventory will not reflect this increase in value. There will be a loss on the derivative hedging the inventory since the derivatives always reflect changes in the market price. An adjustment is made to reflect the unrealised market increase of the commercial storage. As a result, loss on derivatives is matched by a similar adjustment for the exposure being managed. If market prices decrease below cost price, the write-down of the inventory and the derivative e/ffect in the IFRS income statement will o/ffset each other and no adjustment is made\n- \u00b7 Over/underlift: Over/underlift is accounted for using the sales method and therefore revenues were reflected in the period the product was sold rather than in the period it was produced. The over/underlift position depended on a number of factors related to our lifting programme and the way it corresponded to our entitlement share of production. The e/ffect on income for the period is therefore adjusted, to show estimated revenues and associated costs based upon the production for the period to reflect operational performance and comparability with peers.\n- \u00b7 The operational storage is not hedged and is not part of the trading portfolio. Cost of goods sold is measured based on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method, and includes realised gains or losses that arise due to changes in market prices. These gains or losses will fluctuate from one period to another and are not considered part of the underlying operations for the period\n- \u00b7 Impairment and reversal of impairment are excluded from adjusted earnings since they a/ffect the economics of an asset for the lifetime of that asset, not only the period in which it is impaired or the impairment is reversed. Impairment and reversal of impairment can impact both the exploration expenses and the depreciation, amortisation and net impairments line items\n- \u00b7 Gain or loss from sales of assets is eliminated from the measure since the gain or loss does not give an indication of future performance or periodic performance; such a gain or loss is related to the cumulative value creation from the time the asset is acquired until it is sold",

        "page_content": "\u00b7\n\n- Eliminations (Internal unrealised profit on inventories:): Volumes derived from equity oil inventory will vary depending on several factors and inventory strategies, i.e. level of crude oil in inventory, equity oil used in the refining process and level of in-transit cargoes. Internal profit related to volumes sold between entities within the group, and still in inventory at period end, is eliminated according to IFRS (write down to production cost). The proportion of realised versus unrealised gain will fluctuate from one period to another due to inventory strategies and consequently impact net operating income/(loss). Write-down to production cost is not assessed to be a part of the underlying operational performance, and elimination of internal profit related to equity volumes is excluded in adjusted earnings\n- \u00b7 Other items of income and expense are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period. Such items may be unusual or infrequent transactions but they may also include transactions that are significant which would not necessarily qualify as either unusual or infrequent. However, other items adjusted do not constitute normal, recurring income and operating expenses for the company. Other items are carefully assessed and can include transactions such as provisions related to reorganisation, early retirement, etc.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Change in accounting policy are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are unusual or infrequent, and not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax - equals the sum of net operating income/(loss) less income tax in reporting segments and adjustments to operating income taking the applicable marginal tax into consideration. Adjusted earnings after tax excludes net financial items and the associated tax e/ffects on net financial items. It is based on adjusted earnings less the tax e/ffects on all elements included in adjusted earnings (or calculated tax on operating income and on each of the adjusting items using an estimated marginal tax rate). In addition, tax e/ffect related to tax exposure items not related to the individual reporting period is excluded from adjusted earnings after tax. Management considers adjusted earnings after tax, which reflects a normalised tax charge associated with its operational performance excluding the impact of financing, to be a supplemental measure to Equinor's net income. Certain net USD denominated financial positions are held by group companies that have a USD functional currency that is di/fferent from the currency in which the taxable income is measured. As currency exchange rates change between periods, the basis for measuring net financial\n\nitems for IFRS will change disproportionally with taxable income which includes exchange gains and losses from translating the net USD denominated financial positions into the currency of the applicable tax return. Therefore, the e/ffective tax rate may be significantly higher or lower than the statutory tax rate for any given period. Adjusted taxes included in adjusted earnings after tax should not be considered indicative of the amount of current or total tax expense (or taxes payable) for the period.\n\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax should be considered additional measures rather than substitutes for net operating income/(loss) and net income/(loss), which are the most directly comparable IFRS measures. There are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax compared with the IFRS measures as such non-GAAP measures do not include all the items of revenues/gains or expenses/losses of Equinor that are needed to evaluate its profitability on an overall basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are only intended to be indicative of the underlying developments in trends of our ongoing operations for the production, manufacturing and marketing of our products and exclude pre-and post-tax impacts of net financial items. Equinor reflects\n\nsuch underlying development in our operations by eliminating the e/ffects of certain items that may not be directly associated with the period's operations or financing. However, for that reason, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are not complete measures of profitability. These measures should therefore not be used in isolation.",

The calculation of gross capital expenditures excludes additions to right of use assets related to leases, as management believes that this better reflects the Group's investments in the business to drive growth.\n\nIn 2022, a net total adjustment of USD 0.4 billion was excluded, resulting in gross capital expenditures of USD 9.6 billion. In 2021, a net total adjustment of USD 0.3 billion was included, resulting in gross capital expenditures of USD 8.8 billion.\n\nForward-looking gross capital expenditures included in this report are not reconcilable to its most directly comparable IFRS measure without unreasonable e/fforts, because the amounts excluded from such IFRS measure to determine gross capital expenditures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Miscellaneous terms\n\n- \u00b7 Appraisal well: A well drilled to establish the extent and the size of a discovery\n- \u00b7 Biofuel: A solid, liquid or gaseous fuel derived from relatively recently dead biological material and is distinguished from fossil fuels, which are derived from long dead biological material\n- \u00b7 BOE (barrels of oil equivalent): A measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content\n- \u00b7 Condensates: The heavier natural gas components, such as pentane, hexane, iceptane and so forth, which are liquid under atmospheric pressure - also called natural gasoline or naphtha\n- \u00b7 Crude oil, or oil: Includes condensate and natural gas liquids\n- \u00b7 Development: The drilling, construction, and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production of crude oil and natural gas fields\n- \u00b7 Downstream: The selling and distribution of products derived from upstream activities\n- \u00b7 Equity and entitlement volumes of oil and gas: Equity volumes represent volumes produced under a production sharing agreement (PSA) that correspond to Equinor's percentage ownership in a particular field. Entitlement volumes, on the other hand, represent Equinor's share of the volumes distributed to the partners in the field, which are subject to deductions for, among other things, royalties and the host government's share of profit oil. Under the terms of a PSA, the amount of profit oil deducted from equity volumes will normally increase with the cumulative return on investment to the partners and/or production from the licence. The distinction between equity and entitlement is relevant to most PSA regimes, whereas it is not applicable in most concessionary regimes such as those in Norway, the UK, Canada and Brazil. The overview of equity production provides additional information for readers, as certain costs described in the profit and loss analysis were directly associated with equity volumes produced during the reported years\n- \u00b7 Heavy oil: Crude oil with high viscosity (typically above 10 cp), and high specific gravity. The API classifies heavy oil as crudes with a gravity below 22.3\u00b0 API. In addition to high viscosity and high specific gravity, heavy oils typically have low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios, high asphaltene, sulphur, nitrogen, and heavy-metal content, as well as higher acid numbers\n- \u00b7 High grade: Relates to selectively harvesting goods, to cut the best and leave the rest. In reference to exploration and production this entails strict prioritisation and sequencing of drilling targets\n- \u00b7 Hydro: A reference to the oil and energy activities of Norsk Hydro ASA, which merged with Equinor ASA\n- \u00b7 IOR (improved oil recovery): Actual measures resulting in an increased oil recovery factor from a reservoir as compared with the expected value at a certain reference point in time. IOR comprises both of conventional and emerging technologies\n- \u00b7 Liquids: Refers to oil, condensates and NGL\n- \u00b7 LNG (liquefied natural gas): Lean gas - primarily methane - converted to liquid form through refrigeration to minus 163 degrees Celsius under atmospheric pressures\n- \u00b7 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas): Consists primarily of propane and butane, which turn liquid under a pressure of six to seven atmospheres. LPG is shipped in special vessels\n- \u00b7 Midstream: Processing, storage, and transport of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and sulphur\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nADDITIONAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\n- \u00b7 Naphtha: inflammable oil obtained by the dry distillation of petroleum\n- \u00b7 Natural gas: Petroleum that consists principally of light hydrocarbons. It can be divided into 1) lean gas, primarily methane but often containing some ethane and smaller quantities of heavier hydrocarbons (also called sales gas) and 2) wet gas, primarily ethane, propane and butane as well as smaller amounts of heavier hydrocarbons; partially liquid under atmospheric pressure\n- \u00b7 NGL (natural gas liquids): Light hydrocarbons mainly consisting of ethane, propane and butane which are liquid under pressure at normal temperature\n- \u00b7 Oil sands: A naturally occurring mixture of bitumen, water, sand, and clay. A heavy viscous form of crude oil\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas value chains: Describes the value that is being added at each step from 1) exploring; 2) developing; 3) producing; 4) transportation and refining; and 5) marketing and distribution\n- \u00b7 Oslo B\u00f8rs: Oslo stock exchange (OSE)\n- \u00b7 Peer group: Equinor's peer group consists of Equinor, bp, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Galp, Lundin, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and \u00d8rsted.\n- \u00b7 Petroleum: A collective term for hydrocarbons, whether solid, liquid or gaseous. Hydrocarbons are compounds formed from the elements hydrogen (H) and carbon (C). The proportion of di/fferent compounds, from methane and ethane up to the heaviest components, in a petroleum find varies from discovery to discovery. If a reservoir primarily contains light hydrocarbons, it is described as a gas field. If heavier hydrocarbons predominate, it is described as an oil field. An oil field may feature free gas above the oil and contain a quantity of light hydrocarbons, also called associated gas\n- \u00b7 Proved reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation\n- \u00b7 Refining reference margin: Is a typical average gross margin of our two refineries, Mongstad and Kalundborg. The reference margin will di/ffer from the actual margin, due to variations in type of crude and other feedstock, throughput, product yields, freight cost, inventory etc\n- \u00b7 Rig year: A measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. It is calculated as the number of days rigs are operating divided by the number of days in the period\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 GHG emissions: Direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned and/or controlled by the organisation (Source: Greenhouse gas protocol). The global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 is, in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (2022), considered to be 28 times the GWP of CO\u2082.\n- \u00b7 Upstream: Includes the searching for potential underground or underwater oil and gas fields, drilling of exploratory wells, subsequent operating wells which bring the liquids and or natural gas to the surface\n- \u00b7 VOC (volatile organic compounds): Organic chemical compounds that have high enough vapour pressures under normal conditions to significantly vaporise and enter the earth's atmosphere (e.g. gasses formed under loading and o/ffloading of crude oil)",

Should society's demands and technological innovation not shift in parallel with Equinor's pursuit of its energy transition plan, Equinor's ability to meet its climate ambitions will be impaired. The calculation of Equinor's net carbon intensity presented in this report includes an estimate of emissions from the use of sold products (GHG protocol category 11) as a means to more accurately evaluate the emission lifecycle of what we produce to respond to the energy transition and potential business opportunities arising from shifting consumer demands. Including these emissions in the calculations should in no way be construed as an acceptance by Equinor of responsibility for the emissions caused by such use.\n\n2022 Artbox Report Template  All rights reserved \u00a9 Artbox AS 2022\n\nThe reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply Equinor views any particular scenario as likely to occur. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not Equinor, and their use by Equinor is not an endorsement by Equinor of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of Equinor's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by Equinor of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nWe use certain terms in this document, such as 'resource' and 'resources' that the SEC's rules prohibit us from including in our filings with the SEC. U.S. investors are urged to closely consider the disclosures in our annual report on Form 20-F, SEC File No. 1-15200, which is available on our website or by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or logging on to www.sec.gov.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our future results, level of activity, performance or achievements will meet these expectations. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forwardlooking statements. Unless we are required by law to update these statements, we will not necessarily update any of these statements after the date of this integrated annual report, either to make them conform to actual results or changes in our expectations.",
