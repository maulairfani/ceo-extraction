Today, the tools at our disposal are broader and more powerful than they were 100 years ago, when insulin had just been discovered. Yet the need for further innovation to realise our goal has never been greater, not least given the rise of obesity as one of the world's foremost healthcare challenges.\n\nAt a time of societal debate about purpose versus profit, Novo Nordisk shows how the two can go hand-in-hand. The development of our life-changing treatments creates financial rewards that are reinvested in further research and development, a model that we will continue to apply as we build a sustainable business for the decades to come.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the past year, we have seen continued strong growth across both North America and International Operations and therapy areas. This was driven by exceptional demand for our market-leading GLP-1 therapies. In turn, this increase in demand led to further market share expansion for key products in both diabetes and obesity.\n\nAt the same time, however, we have experienced pressures and challenges from an increasingly difficult macroeconomic\n\nand geopolitical environment, including the impact of war in Ukraine, rising tensions in global trade and the continuing fallout from COVID-19.\n\nCombined with higher than expected demand, temporary capacity limitations at some of our manufacturing sites have resulted in shortages of certain products, including Wegovy \u00ae for obesity and Ozempic \u00ae for type 2 diabetes.",

Like many other large companies, we are restructuring our supply chains to increase resilience in a volatile world.\n\nIt is clear that economic challenges and the growing burden of chronic, non-communicable diseases will place increasing pressure on healthcare systems in the years ahead, requiring us to remain laser-focused on our purpose and strategy.\n\nProgress on pipeline projects such as our once-weekly insulin icodec and the novel combination drug candidate CagriSema, for both obesity and diabetes, reflects our determination to break new ground. We are also addressing broader areas of unmet medical need by expanding our commitment to rare blood and endocrine disease and researching novel technology platforms.\n\nThis will involve continued investment in our company's deep in-house expertise, coupled with sourcing the best science from outside, through partnerships and business development. The acquisition of Forma Therapeutics in 2022, a specialist in rare blood disorders, is a good example of this targeted approach.\n\nOur teams are also increasingly applying novel technologies to improve the delivery of products, including the use of smart devices and digital tools to guide and optimise therapy.\n\nInnovation is equally central in addressing the environmental and social challenges that rightly feature so highly in modern society's expectations of businesses. The challenge we face\n\nis significant since Novo Nordisk has an unusually high growth rate for a company of its size, necessitating increased manufacturing and higher product shipments.\n\nHowever, in 2020, we were able to switch our global production network to sourcing 100% renewable power and we will continue to challenge ourselves in order to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2045. We will also continue to innovate to minimise the use of plastic derived from fossil fuels in our pen devices, whether through recycling or the use of novel materials.\n\n## 'Globally, we are serving a record of almost 40 million patients.'\n\nGlobally, we are serving a record of almost 40 million patients. However, there are still many people who struggle to access our life-changing products, even though more than 5 million are reached through our access and affordability initiatives. Innovation has a role to play here as well. Our heat-stable insulins, for example, will help to improve access in low- and middle-income countries since they can be kept outside refrigeration for up to four weeks.\n\nOur priority for the next 10 years is to advance scientific understanding and treatment options in our core therapy areas, while diversifying our pipeline into adjacent fields such as cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare blood disorders. This means looking beyond the success of products based on our leading GLP-1 molecule semaglutide and adopting new technologies.\n\nInnovation itself depends on the creativity of our colleagues, which we will continue to nurture by making Novo Nordisk a truly inclusive and diverse workplace. This will empower employees to use all their capabilities while attracting the best talent to come and work with us.\n\nDiversity is just as important in the boardroom as in our wider organisation, so we will continue to focus on having a Board of Directors with the right expertise and perspective to guide us through a period of rapid change. We are delighted by the election of Christina Law, whose deep experience in leadership positions in consumer-driven companies across Asia and beyond is and will be invaluable.\n\nThe collaboration between the Board of Directors and Executive Management continues to be both trusting and transparent. The relationship grew further during a year in which we were able to increasingly meet each other in person and engage with Novo Nordisk colleagues applying themselves tirelessly to delivering tomorrow's healthcare innovation.\n\nWe would like to thank all our colleagues around the world for their dedication and hard work during a challenging year, as well as our shareholders for their continued support.\n\nHelge Lund Chair of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresident and CEO",

This mission is embedded in our business, with environmental, social and financial responsibility having been anchored in our Articles of Association since 2004.\n\nWe believe that sustainability is not only the right path to take for the communities we serve and the planet, it is also an essential part of future-proofing our business. We are determined to further accelerate in this area as demands on corporations grow. Our position as a large healthcare company tackling serious chronic diseases places us on the frontline of many of today's biggest challenges. We recognise the urgent need to both improve access to our medicines and reduce our environmental impact. Our work in areas from the development of heat-stable insulin for use in vulnerable settings to sourcing renewable power and plastic recycling marks significant milestones along these intertwined tracks.",

The calculation of Scope 3 emissions was substantially based on estimations and therefore inherently uncertain.\n\nWith carbon emissions from fossil fuels continuing to rise, the warnings about global warming are becoming louder. The message from the COP27 meeting in Egypt last year was clear: decisive action is needed now - particularly from the private sector - if we are to turn the tide on climate change.\n\nAs a sustainable business, it is our responsibility to reduce our carbon emissions as swiftly as possible, meeting our target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. More nearterm, we have pledged to reach zero emissions from our operations and transportation by 2030. As we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions by 43% since 2019, 96% of our emissions are Scope 3, meaning they are not in our direct control, but rather include in particular the consequences of goods and services procured from our 60,000+ suppliers.\n\n## Emissions from operations and transportation (1,000 tonnes CO2)\n\nTarget 2030: zero emissions from operations and transportation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Road towards net-zero emissions\n\nThere are inherent challenges in reducing emissions at a time when demand for our life-changing medicines is growing rapidly, resulting in increased manufacturing and more product shipments. Nonetheless, by switching our global production network to sourcing 100% renewable power and by leveraging biogas in two of our production sites, we have managed to decrease production-related Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions by 8% (equal to around 3,000 tonnes) in the past year, and by 58% (equal to around 50,000 tonnes) compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. However, CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation were higher in 2022 than in 2021, partly reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on 2021 activities (in 2022, CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation decreased by 29% compared to 2019), but especially due to increased emissions from transportation, as supply chain constraints have forced us to increase our use of airfreight to ensure timely delivery of our medicines to patients globally. Due to our extensive supply chain, we have a target for all our 60,000+ suppliers, to be reached by 2030, to source 100% renewable power when supplying us. Already more than 500 of our key suppliers have committed to source renewable power, which has resulted in a saving of more than 30,000 tonnes of CO 2 since 2019 (equal to 1% of our emissions in 2022).\n\nPartnerships will be an essential part of addressing the supply chain challenge. In 2022, we made alliances with Kuehne+Nagel and SkyNRG for Sustainable Aviation Fuel that will reduce our emissions from air transport significantly. The\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonising health systems through publicprivate partnerships\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA promising partnership addressing supply chain challenges and overall decarbonisation of healthcare is the Sustainable Markets Initiative - Health Systems Taskforce. This public-private partnership brings together CEOs from leading organisations in the pharmaceutical sector, such as AstraZeneca, GSK, Merck KGaA, Roche, Sanofi, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, NHS England and leading health research institutions. While initiated by HRH King Charles III in the UK, the partnership is global in scope.\n\nBy agreeing on a set of concrete commitments and initiatives, launched ahead of COP27, the group seeks to harness its collective influence to urgently address the need to make the healthcare sector more sustainable. This entails overall efforts towards decarbonisation, but also for prevention of disease onset and efficient delivery of care.",

Scope 3 emissions are measured in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), except for Business travel.  2. For more information, please refer to section 6 and to note 7.4 on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\ncollaboration with SkyNRG, for example, will enable us to cut CO 2 emissions from airfreight by around 19,000 tonnes every year (equal to 1% of our emissions in 2022), starting in 2027.\n\nAt the same time, as part of our target to reach zero emissions from our operations and transportation by 2030, we plan to shift our production sites towards biogas, derived from organic waste. We also aim to transition to 100% electric company cars by 2030. In both cases there are supply challenges. Biogas production is still in a growth phase, although major expansion is expected in the coming years, while the availability of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure remains limited in many countries.\n\n## Stepping up to the plastic challenge\n\nAnother priority in creating a business with zero environmental impact is minimising the use of plastic derived from fossil fuels. We produced more than 750 million prefilled plastic pen devices in 2022, equal to approximately 13,000 tonnes of plastic, a figure that is set to grow as demand for our medicines increases. We are tackling the challenge through a series of parallel programmes, including efforts to reduce the amount of plastic we use by gradually shifting towards durable rather than pre-filled devices. We are also working to shift to non-fossil fuel plastics, for example by harnessing waste carbon and hydrogen from energy supply processes, including the use of carbon capture.\n\nAdditionally, we have ramped up initiatives to stop our pen devices, classified as medical waste, from going into landfills. A take-back initiative in Denmark that reuses the plastic in these devices has now been expanded to a full-scale national solution, while new recycling pilots have been launched in the UK, France and Brazil.",

As such, we are committed to playing an active role in alleviating barriers to access, wherever they occur. Our ambition is to provide access to affordable care to vulnerable patients in every country. Through a combination of strategic initiatives and partnerships, we aim to help people access the care they need, no matter where they live.\n\n## Improving access to life-changing care in low and middle-income countries\n\nThe number of people with diabetes treated with our products now stands at 36.3 million, an increase of more than 1.7 million from 2021, and close to 5.5 million of these were reached via our access and affordability initiatives. We remain dedicated to our Access to Insulin Commitment, which sets a ceiling price of USD 3 per human insulin vial to governments in 76 countries, as part of our supply prioritisation. An estimated 1.8 million patients accessed care under this commitment in 2022. Please refer to note 8.1 on Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products.\n\nIn 2022, we also continued our efforts to identify vulnerable patients and provide them with access to healthcare and affordable insulin in countries where we operate. We have completed various vulnerability assessments, resulting in 25 plans being implemented across the Asia-Pacific (APAC), Southern and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(SEEMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) regions to benefit vulnerable groups.\n\nWorking together with local health authorities, partners and civil society is a cornerstone of our approach to access, as exemplified by the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children partnership. This programme has now reached 41,033 children with type 1 diabetes in low-resource countries, an increase of almost 29% compared to last year, putting it on track to reach its goal of 100,000 children by 2030.\n\nWe challenge ourselves to pioneer innovative approaches and processes, such as exploring the thermostability platform as\n\nan opportunity to support access for vulnerable people living with diabetes. In April 2022, we obtained a positive European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific opinion supporting the storage of our human insulins, Actrapid \u00ae and Insulatard \u00ae , outside refrigeration for up to four weeks, if kept below 30\u00b0C. The products have additionally received the WHO prequalification, which enables simpler order purchases by United Nations (UN) procurement agencies and other international organisations. Our two products are the first human insulin products to ever obtain this prequalification. The challenge of providing access to affordable insulin is vast and rising to it requires long-term, multi-sector collaboration. We will continue to collaborate with partners to address",

Some patients in the US also struggle to pay for treatments, including insulin, and we have a range of initiatives to help them. By limiting list price increases, securing broad formulary coverage and supporting affordability programs for patients, we aspire to make our medicines more accessible and affordable, especially for those that are un-insured or under-insured.\n\nIn 2022, we provided DKK 261 billion in discounts and rebates, amounting to 75% of US gross sales (in line with 2021), to secure formulary coverage for insured patients. Investing in formulary coverage leads to reasonable copays for many patients. But for some, the benefits fall short and for those that are un-insured or under-insured we continue to provide a broad suite of affordability offerings, having helped more than one million patients afford their medications in 2022.\n\nAs each patient's affordability needs are different, we have invested in enhancements to Novocare.com making it a comprehensive and easy to use resource for patient access and affordability support.

We have donated diabetes and haemophilia medications to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, and together with humanitarian organisations, we continue to monitor the situation to be able to provide further support.\n\nAs part of our humanitarian programme, we have also continued to supply insulins and glucagon kits to humanitarian organisations in other parts of the world, reaching more than 210,000 people. Our partnership with the Red Cross, Partnering for Change, has reached its implementation phase in Lebanon, where our partners are integrating models for chronic care into their local activities. In addition, we established the Senselet partnership in Ethiopia, facilitating healthcare supply chain management.\n\n## Strengthening our prevention efforts\n\nA further crucial pillar in our strategy to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases is prevention, which is urgently needed given the growing burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes across all continents. Our long-standing Cities Changing Diabetes programme continues to work with local partners in 45 cities across the globe on ways to prevent and control diabetes and obesity. But we are also casting the net wider with new initiatives, such as an ambitious global partnership with UNICEF to prevent childhood overweight and obesity.\n\nIn OECD countries, less than 3% of healthcare budgets is dedicated to disease prevention. This provides evidence that\n\nnew funding for disease prevention must be identified. Over the past two years, the Cities Changing Diabetes partnership has supported efforts to develop investment cases for prevention of disease. As an example, a third-party investor could dispose an upfront payment for the expansion of services, and if the agreed targets will be met, the city will save future costs, of which the investor would receive a share.\n\nThe first social impact bond in health in Denmark was issued by the city of Aarhus, with the aim of delivering an intensive prevention programme to 450 citizens living with type 2 diabetes and at high risk of developing severe complications. This solution is anchored in a partnership between Novo Nordisk, local general practitioners, the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and the relevant city administration departments. The initiative is based on implementing a mix of individual, family and community modules over 12 months, with two years of follow-up. The reduction of blood sugar (HbA1c) will be used as an indicator for the three-year payment and the first measurements will be available later in 2023.\n\n## A diverse and inclusive workplace\n\nBeing a sustainable employer offering an inclusive and diverse working environment is an integrated part of being a sustainable business. In 2022, we were recognised as the best place to work at globally by \"Best Places to Work\".\n\nWe fundamentally believe that diversity of people and inclusive leadership drive value for Novo Nordisk by increasing innovation, enabling a diverse line of thought and providing all employees with equitable opportunities to realise their potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cities Changing Diabetes and C40 Cities collaborate on urban development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2015, we have been partnering with the climate organisation C40 Cities, with the purpose of testing and advocating for how cities can achieve increased climate and health benefits through urban investments. In 2019, this research-based partnership applied its learnings to the development of a walking and cycling benefits Excel-based tool that enables users to estimate the health, climate and economic benefits of urban investments aimed at shifting people's mode of transport from inactive to active. Since then, more than 20 cities have used it.\n\nBuilding on this initiative, we are expanding the tool to improve its usability across new cityplanning methods. These include the 15-minute city interventions, a recent concept that cities are applying to increase proximity and thus decrease emissions through less transport. We continue to facilitate the integration of health in cities' climate work through our Cities Changing Diabetes network and drive change for a healthier and more sustainable society.",

At the end of 2022, 49% of all new leaders were women, and 45% of all new senior leaders were women, compared to 48% and 50%, respectively, at the end of 2021. In addition, we are ensuring a strong pipeline of diverse talent and inclusive leaders via succession management and talent programs.\n\nTo mitigate bias in pay processes and decisions, we conduct yearly equal pay reviews and take actions in case of any identified pay gaps. Out of the more than 43,000 positions 3 covered in the pay review in 2022, we identified 0.6% with an equal pay gap 4 and we are taking corrective action.\n\nWe are continuously challenging the customary ways of working and in early 2022, we launched a new global parental leave policy offering a minimum of eight weeks paid leave within the first year of becoming a parent to all non-birthing parents globally, regardless of gender. Our ambition is that recognition of the non-birthing parents' right to leave will result in greater inclusion and equality for parents - both at work and at home.\n\n## Our leaders are held accountable\n\nWe expect all our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders by being committed to building diverse teams of complementary strengths, valuing diverse skills, experiences and perspectives and creating a psychologically safe space in which all employees feel free to speak up.\n\nTo measure the state of inclusion at Novo Nordisk, we have introduced our global 'Inclusion Index' as part of our annual employee engagement survey. Of the more than 39,000 employees who completed the survey in 2022, 82% rated the inclusion statements favourable, compared to 78% in 2021.\n\n3.

As diversity remains important for the Board, it has maintained a voluntary 2024 target of having at least three shareholder-elected Board members who are men and three who are women.\n\nWe have adopted a diversity and inclusion policy to increase the share of the underrepresented gender in upper management. The policy's most significant activities aimed at reaching the gender target are described on page 18. In 2022, the share of women in upper management at Novo Nordisk A/S was 38%, so we have not yet achieved the target level of 45% women in upper management. The target is ambitious, however progress has been made in 2022 compared to 2021 and we still believe the target will be reached by 2025.\n\n## Sustainable tax approach\n\nOur overall guiding principle within taxation is to have a sustainable tax approach, emphasising our business-anchored approach to managing the impact of taxes while remaining true to the Novo Nordisk values of operating our business in a responsible and transparent manner. Our legal structures are based on business-anchored considerations and substance.\n\nConsequently, we pay tax where value is generated and always respect international and domestic tax rules.

The general meeting inter alia adopts the company's Articles of Association, approves the Annual Report and elects the Board of Directors.\n\nAny shareholder has the right to raise questions at general meetings. Resolutions can generally be passed by a simple majority. However, resolutions to amend the Articles of Association require two-thirds of the votes cast and capital represented, unless other adoption requirements are imposed by the Danish Companies Act.\n\nNovo Nordisk has a two-tier management structure consisting of the Board of Directors and Executive Management. The governance structure and rules of Novo Nordisk are further described in our Articles of Association and our Corporate Governance Report, both of which are available at novonordisk.com.\n\n## Foundation ownership\n\nNovo Holdings A/S, a Danish company wholly owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, holds the majority of votes at general meetings.\n\nThe combination of foundation ownership and stock listing enables Novo Nordisk to embark on long-term sustainable strategies while maintaining short-term transparency on performance. Our foundation ownership supports the overarching imperative to be both commercially successful and responsive to the wider needs of society.\n\nThe objective of the Novo Nordisk Foundation is to provide a stable basis for the commercial and research activities of Novo Nordisk, Novozymes and other companies, as well as to support scientific, humanitarian and social purposes. Please refer to the illustration on this page, focused on how we create value for society in conjunction with the Novo Nordisk Foundation. For more information about the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, see page 41.\n\n## Corporate Governance reporting\n\nNovo Nordisk reports in accordance with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen as well as the Corporate Governance Standards of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to foreign private issuers. In 2022, Novo Nordisk complied with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations as we either complied with or explained our approach to the recommendations. You can find further information about our corporate governance practices in our 2022 Corporate Governance Report, in accordance with section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act, available at: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html\n\nNovo Nordisk has prepared a separate Remuneration Report describing the remuneration awarded or due during 2022 to the Board of Directors and Executives registered with the Danish Business Authority.

In most cases the root causes related to leadership competencies, style and behaviours not living up to the Novo Nordisk Way.

Business ethics covers anti-fraud, anti-bribery, anti off-label promotion, transparency in dealing with healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations, the protection of personal data, as well as respect for human rights with the aim of minimising any potential risks to our patients, business, people and stakeholders.\n\nAnnual training in business ethics is mandatory for all employees, including all new hires. In 2022, 99% of employees completed and documented their training, with the remaining 1% missing mainly due to employees being on leave. In 2022, 35 business ethics reviews were completed with 98 findings, compared to 37 reviews with 129 findings in 2021. Consolidated findings are reported to Executive Management and the Audit Committee.\n\nGroup Internal Audit assesses that the level of business ethics compliance is sound. Management action plans and closure of findings progressed as planned and there were no overdue management actions or findings at the end of 2022.\n\nWe have implemented a set of data and artificial intelligence ethics principles in our Global Ethics and Compliance Framework. These principles define Novo Nordisk's ethical data management across the Group and aim to promote a sound and ethical data culture within Novo Nordisk and in all business partner relationships. Ethical data management includes transparency and accountability for decisions and processes involving the use of data.\n\n## Product quality and supplier audits\n\nAt the end of 2021, the contract manufacturer filling syringes for Wegovy \u00ae failed an FDA inspection causing disruption in the supply of Wegovy \u00ae in 2022.\n\nAfter implementing initiatives to improve the compliance level at the contract manufacturer site, the production of Wegovy \u00ae was resumed. In 2022, 150 inspections were conducted, compared to 97 in 2021. At year-end, 113 inspections were passed and 37 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received or the final authority's acceptance was pending. Follow-up on unresolved inspections will continue in 2023. Please see note 9.4 on Failed inspections for further information.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 294 supplier audits were conducted to assess compliance levels with our supplier standards.\n\nIn 2022, we had 3 product recalls from the market. Please see note 9.3 on Product recalls for further information.\n\n## Financial and ESG assurance\n\nWe are committed to ensuring the accuracy of our financial and ESG reporting. Our financial reporting and the internal controls of financial reporting processes are audited according to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by an independent audit firm elected at the Annual General Meeting. As part of our ESG responsibility, we voluntarily include an Assurance Report from an independent external auditor for ESG reporting in the Annual Report. The assurance provider reviews whether the consolidated ESG statement is accurately presented.\n\nOur internal audit function provides independent and objective assurance, primarily within internal control of financial processes, IT security and business ethics. As of 2022, our internal audit function also provides assurance within internal control of ESG reporting. As part of our ESG responsibility, the Audit Committee also oversees our ESG reporting. We thereby ensure that our ESG reporting is\n\nsubject to the same robust governance that applies to our financial reporting. To ensure that the internal audit function operates independently of Executive Management, its charter, audit plan and budget are approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee must approve the appointment, remuneration and dismissal of the head of the internal audit function.\n\n## Integrated reporting approach\n\n## Sustainability frameworks and performance\n\nWe report on our ESG performance in accordance with relevant disclosure frameworks, including those of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF) / Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation. This year, we augmented our disclosures regarding the average list and net price of our US product portfolio and US insulin portfolio by incorporating them into our ESG statement (please refer to note 8.6 on US pricing).\n\nWe continue working on implementing recommendations from the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), taking a stepwise approach to incorporating material climate-related risk-assessments into our governance, strategy and execution on climate and environmentally related initiatives. As recommended, we work to identify, assess and mitigate short-, medium- and long-term climaterelated risks within our operations and supply chain, such as flooding, storm surges, earthquakes, tornadoes and wildfires that could disrupt production. Annually, we map risk levels from lowest to highest risk. Based on the assigned risk level, mitigation plans are implemented at production site level.",

It enables corporates to communicate to investors which of their business activities have the potential to be considered sustainable (i.e., are 'Taxonomy-eligible') or can in fact be considered sustainable (i.e., are 'Taxonomyaligned'). For each relevant business activity, the corporate has to disclose how much of its Turnover, Operating Expenditures (OpEx) and Capital Expenditures (CapEx) can be considered eligible and aligned, respectively.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy's currently published environmental objectives on climate change mitigation and climate change adaption do not directly apply to the pharmaceutical sector. However, we reviewed the relevant activities and assessed their applicability to our core business. Because of the nature of our business activities, we do not have any Taxonomy-eligible Turnover. Regarding OpEx, we apply the exemption and report this at zero. However, we can report\n\n## EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment\n\n| Economic   activity                              | Total   (DKK million)   | Eligible  (DKK million)   | Eligible   (%)   |   Aligned  (DKK million) |   Aligned  (%) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| Turnover                                         | 176,954                 | 0                         | 0                |                        0 |              0 |\n| OpEx                                             | 23,348                  | 0                         | 0                |                        0 |              0 |\n| CapEx                                            | 23,961                  | 3,173                     | 13%              |                        0 |              0 |\n| Hereof  7.1  Construction of  new buildings      |                         | 1,166                     | 5%               |                        0 |              0 |\n| Hereof  7.2  Renovation   of existing  buildings |                         | 2,007                     | 8%               |                        0 |              0 |\n\n13% Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for two economic activities. Given the ambiguity around evidencing Taxonomy alignment and lack of required information to confirm adherence with technical screening criteria, we do not have any Taxonomy alignment to disclose this year.\n\n## Eligibility and alignment\n\nWe followed a two-step process to arrive at our present Taxonomy disclosures. Firstly, we screened the Taxonomy rules to create a list of economic activities that could potentially be eligible. The description of each economic activity was assessed against how we perform the economic activity. Then, after applying materiality considerations, we decided to report Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for economic activities 7.1 and 7.2, i.e., regarding the construction of new buildings and the renovation of existing buildings, respectively. Secondly, we evaluated whether we could classify any of our Taxonomyeligible CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## CapEx:\n\nTotal CapEx consists of additions to fixed assets (including Financial lease) and intangible assets. Additions resulting from business combinations are also included. Goodwill is not included in CapEx because it is not defined as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38. The CapEx KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible CapEx (numerator) divided by total CapEx (denominator).\n\n## OpEx:\n\nOpEx consists of direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation, shortterm lease, maintenance and repair and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of property,\n\nplant and equipment assets. The OpEx KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible OpEx (numerator) divided by total OpEx (denominator).\n\n## Double counting:\n\nNone of our activities contribute to multiple objectives. For the CapEx and OpEx allocations, we have identified the relevant purchases and measures as well as the primary related economic activity in the Climate Delegated Act. Thereby, we ensure that no CapEx or OpEx is double-counted. We are adjusting the R&D cost for amortisations in order not to double count these costs, as the amortisation would also have been part of CapEx in prior years.\n\n## Disaggregation of KPIs:\n\nOur identified economic activities do not require disaggregation of KPIs.\n\n## Contextual information about the CapEx KPI:\n\nOur Taxonomy-eligible CapEx pertaining to the construction of new buildings and the renovation of existing buildings mainly relates to the expansion of production capacity by either building new facilities or improving existing facilities to expand yield.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe will keep focusing on the requirements of the evolving EU Taxonomy as we expect future rules to also apply to our sector directly.",

Our increasingly diverse pipeline is expanding with the number of early-stage drug candidates almost doubling over the past three years. In late-stage development, we are focused on expanding indications within our existing portfolio and continue to test the boundaries of what our molecules are capable of in different dose strengths. The continuous optimisation of our drug development process also means that we expect to be able to progress our pipeline and projects much faster in the future without compromising safety or quality.\n\nBuilding on our core capabilities in protein and peptide engineering by investing in digitalisation and next-generation technology platforms - such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference, cell therapy and gene editing - will be pivotal to these endeavours. By focusing on new opportunities to leverage disease and patient data, we are working towards offering patient-oriented solutions that fully integrate drug, device, digital, diagnostics and data. We believe that applying this \"5D\" approach across our early- and late-stage projects will deliver more convenient and better products and devices, benefiting both patients and wider society.\n\n## Further raise the innovation bar for diabetes treatment\n\nA century on from first commercialising the production of insulin, we are continually raising the innovation bar for diabetes treatment to help more of the growing number of people around the world living with the condition.

This includes the aforementioned combination therapy CagriSema, which has now also commenced large-scale phase 3 trials in obesity. Cagrilintide works by reducing appetite by targeting specific parts of the brain, thereby providing an additive effect to semaglutide.\n\nIn addition, we are continuing a phase 3 study of 50 mg once-daily oral semaglutide as a potential additional treatment option in obesity.\n\n## Strengthen and progress the Rare Disease pipeline\n\nWe are expanding into new areas and advancing the development of key products within our Rare Disease unit - comprising treatments for rare blood, rare renal and endocrine disorders - in a strategy to grow existing operations and expand the core business.\n\nThis includes the initiation of phase 3 development of Mim8, a next-generation subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for haemophilia A, as well as the submission of nedosiran, an advanced RNA interference (RNAi) drug candidate developed for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH), a rare inherited condition affecting the kidneys and the liver.\n\nWe have also strengthened our presence in haemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, with the acquisition of Forma Therapeutics.

Our commercial teams have shown agility and ingenuity in delivering our medicines to more patients than ever before. As a result, we have grown market share and launched key products, allowing us to make significant progress across our strategic aspirations for commercial execution.\n\nHowever, it has not been easy. COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine have adversely impacted global supply chains, while higher than expected demand, including for our GLP-1 products and temporary capacity limitations at some of our manufacturing sites have led to periodic supply constraints for some of our products - including our flagship GLP-1 therapies Ozempic \u00ae and Wegovy \u00ae - which we expect to continue into 2023.\n\nWe have responded by ramping up production, with our global manufacturing facilities now operating 24 hours a",

As a result, all dose strengths of Wegovy \u00ae are now available in the US and we have also made the product available in the first markets within International Operations.\n\nIn Russia, we have suspended marketing investments and changed our focus from launching new medications and clinical investment, to securing supply of insulin to ensure our patients have access to these essential medicines. Our factory in Russia supplies insulin to patients in Russia only.\n\nDespite these unprecedented challenges, we have seen overall sales growth of 16%, at CER, across our global operations - among the highest in the pharmaceutical\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commercial execution\n\n- Strengthen Diabetes leadership aim at global value market share of more than 1/3 1\n- More than DKK 25 billion in Obesity sales by 2025 2\n- Secure a sustained growth outlook for Rare Disease 3\n\nindustry - driven by our strong product line-up. To further accelerate this growth, we have created a new global Commercial Strategy organisation based around three therapy areas - diabetes, obesity and other serious chronic diseases - that will drive greater focus across our broadening portfolio. Crucially, each unit will have full functional responsibility, including therapy area strategy and ambition, early planning, access, commercial strategies, launch preparations and digital solutions.\n\nThese endeavours mean that we are progressing towards our aspirations of achieving a global diabetes value market share of more than one-third and recording obesity sales of over DKK 25 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, our Rare Disease business continues to make progress towards our aspiration for sustained growth, driven by a strong pipeline and an exciting line-up of new products.\n\n## Strengthen diabetes leadership - aim at global value market share of more than 1/3\n\nIn the diabetes space, we increased our value market share by 1.8 percentage points to 31.9%, driven by strong growth for our GLP-1 products across both North America and International Operations. We continue to benefit from the growing switch to greater use of GLP-1s around the world, although rates of uptake vary widely between regions. In the US, where GLP-1 use is the highest, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in diabetes treatment following the launch of Ozempic \u00ae and our once-weekly injectable is now the country's best-selling diabetes product.\n\nDespite the arrival of more competition, we remain the global market leader in the GLP-1 segment with our type 2 diabetes products Rybelsus \u00ae , Ozempic \u00ae and Victoza \u00ae . Ozempic \u00ae has now been launched in 75 countries and Rybelsus \u00ae , our oral\n\nGLP-1 medicine, is available in 43 markets. The strong growth of these newer products has more than offset a fall in sales of Victoza \u00ae and our GLP-1 value market share has risen by 2.2% from a year ago to 54.9%.\n\nThe picture is different for insulin, where sales are in decline in both operating units. Yet, Novo Nordisk's insulin value market share has increased from 43.8% to 44.6% in the last 12 months. North America insulin sales were hit by lower realised prices in the US, due to intensified biosimilar competition and higher demanded rebates coupled with channel and payer mix, as well as flat to declining class volume growth. Within International Operations, where we provide significantly more people with insulin than any other class of product, insulin sales are growing in emerging markets. However, sales have declined in China due to the implementation of Volume Based Procurement and sales in EMEA were also lower.\n\n## Diabetes value market share (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|       | 52.7%   | 54.9%   |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| 50.5% | 50.5%   | 50.5%   |\n| 44.3% | 43.8%   | 44.6%   |\n| 29.3% | 30.1%   | 31.9%   |\n| 2020  | 2021    | 2022    |\n\nSource: IQVIA MAT, Nov 2022.",

It is becoming clear that the efficacy of Wegovy \u00ae has changed perceptions around obesity treatment, both among clinicians and patients - a fact reflected in the higher than expected demand for the product in the US. Encouragingly, the availability of anti-obesity medication is improving around the world, with around 80% of commercial formularies in the US now providing access and around 15 other countries offering varying levels of reimbursement.\n\nWithin this accelerating global obesity market, we are capturing the vast majority of growth and we expect to build on this significantly in 2023 as we resolve Wegovy \u00ae supply constraints. The volume growth of the global branded obesity market was 63%. Outside the US market, our first-generation GLP-1 obesity drug Saxenda \u00ae has seen continued robust uptake and we hope to build on this in 2023 with the launch of Wegovy \u00ae in more countries across International Operations.\n\nThe global obesity epidemic is now estimated to affect more than 750 million people. Importantly, our pipeline contains\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nnew products that may offer even greater weight loss efficacy.\n\n## Secure a sustained growth outlook for Rare Disease\n\nRare Disease growth has been driven by our treatments for rare blood disorders, fueled by demand for NovoSeven \u00ae and the newly launched products Esperoct \u00ae and Refixia \u00ae . Sales of haemophilia A and haemophilia B products increased by 6% and 16%, respectively. Sales of rare endocrine disorder products were broadly flat, with revenues held back by lower realised prices in the US. However, we remain the leading company in the global human growth disorder market with a value share of 35.2%, which is comparable to last year.\n\nWe are excited by the imminent arrival of new products in the Rare Disease portfolio. These include our once-weekly Sogroya \u00ae injection for children living with growth hormone deficiency, which is expected to launch in 2023 following regulatory approvals, and our next-generation rare blood disorder therapies concizumab and Mim8.\n\n## Focusing on other serious chronic diseases\n\nBeyond the main pillars of our established business, we are expanding our work into other serious chronic diseases, many of which are associated with diabetes and obesity. In the short term, this involves leveraging potential broader indications for semaglutide and building up our primary care footprint for entry of stand-alone cardiovascular products.\n\nExpanding into new treatments for diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Alzheimer's disease is a growing focus for our teams and forms a central plank of our commercial strategy as we look to maintain momentum in the second half of the decade and beyond.",

The increase in costs is driven by both International Operations and North America Operations. In International Operations, promotional spend is related to promotional activities for Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae , as well as Obesity care market development activities. In North America Operations, the cost increase is driven by promotional activities for Ozempic \u00ae and market development activities for Obesity care. The increase is also reflecting higher distribution costs.\n\nResearch and development costs increased by 35% measured in Danish kroner and by 29% at CER to DKK 24,047 million reflecting increased late-stage clinical trial activity compared to 2022. Increased activities within Other serious chronic diseases and GLP-1 are driving the cost increase as well as the operating costs and amortisations related to Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc. which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. The cost increase also reflects inflationary impacts on the cost base.\n\nAdministration costs increased by 10% measured in Danish kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 4,467 million.\n\nOther operating income and expenses (net) was DKK 1,034 million compared with DKK 332 million in 2021, driven by income from partnerships related to Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nOperating profit increased by 28% measured in Danish kroner and by 15% at CER to DKK 74,809 million.

The foreign exchange result was a net loss of DKK 4,651 million compared with a net gain of DKK 344 million in 2021. This primarily reflects losses on hedged currencies, primarily the US dollar.\n\nAs per the end of December 2022, a positive market value of financial contracts of approximately DKK 1.0 billion has been deferred for recognition in 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 19.6% in 2022 compared with an effective tax rate of 19.2% in 2021, mainly reflecting non-recurring impacts from acquisitions.\n\nNet profit increased by 16% to DKK 55,525 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 18% to DKK 24.44.\n\n## Cash flow and capital allocation\n\nFree cash flow was DKK 57.4 billion compared with DKK 29.3 billion in 2021 supporting the strategic aspiration to deliver attractive capital allocation to shareholders. The cash conversion in 2022 is positively impacted by timing of payment of rebates in the US, including provisions related to the revised 340B distribution policy in the US.

Expectations for 2023.\n\nCapital expenditure for property, plant and equipment was DKK 12.1 billion compared with DKK 6.3 billion in 2021.\n\n## 2023 outlook\n\nSales growth is expected to be 13% to 19% at CER. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, sales growth reported in DKK is expected to be around 4 percentage points lower than at CER.\n\nThe guidance reflects expectations for sales growth in both North America Operations and International Operations, mainly driven by volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments for Diabetes and Obesity care, partially countered by declining sales in Rare Disease due to supply constraints. Intensifying competition and continued pricing pressure within Diabetes care are included in the guidance.\n\nThe guidance ranges reflect the level of volume growth of GLP-1-based diabetes treatments and the inherent uncertainty of the pace of Obesity care market expansion following the relaunch of Wegovy \u00ae in the US and an expected gradual roll-out in International Operations.\n\nFollowing higher than expected volume growth in recent years, including GLP-1-based products such as Ozempic \u00ae , combined with the expectation of continued volume growth and capacity limitations at some manufacturing sites, the outlook also reflects expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications across a number of products and geographies. The supply capacity is gradually being expanded.\n\nOperating profit growth is expected to be 13% to 19% at CER. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now expected to be around 5 percentage points lower than at CER. The expectation for operating profit growth primarily reflects the sales growth outlook and continued investments in future and current growth drivers within Research, Development and Commercial. Within R&D, investments are related to the continued expansion of the pipeline. Commercial investments are mainly related to the relaunch of Wegovy \u00ae in the US, Obesity care market development activities in International\n\nOperations as well as promotional activities for Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae . Finally, the guidance also reflects inflationary impacts on the cost base.\n\nNovo Nordisk expects financial items (net) to amount to a gain of around DKK 2.4 billion, mainly reflecting gains associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 19-21%.\n\nCapital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 25 billion in 2023, reflecting the innovation based growth strategy pursued by Novo Nordisk. The CapEx increase is primarily relating to investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production and fill-finish capacity for both current and future injectable and oral products. In the coming years, the capital expenditure to sales ratio is expected to be low double digit.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses are expected to be around DKK 8 billion.\n\nThe free cash flow is expected to be DKK 60-68 billion, reflecting the sales growth and the investments in capital expenditure as well as a favourable impact from rebates in the US.\n\nAll of the above expectations are based on assumptions that the global or regional macroeconomic and political environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2023, including energy and supply chain disruptions, the potential implications from major healthcare reforms and legislative changes as well as outcome of legal cases including litigations related",

The company expects to distribute an interim dividend in August 2023. Further information regarding this interim dividend will be announced in connection with the financial report for the first six months of 2023. Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Novo Nordisk does not pay a dividend on its holding of treasury shares.\n\n## Share repurchase programme for 2022/2023\n\nDuring the twelve-month period beginning 2 February 2022, Novo Nordisk repurchased shares worth DKK 24 billion. The share repurchase programme has primarily been conducted in accordance with the safe harbour rules in the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR). 6\n\nFor the next 12 months, Novo Nordisk has decided to implement a new share repurchase programme. The expected total repurchase value of B shares amounts to a cash value of up to DKK 28 billion. The total programme may be reduced in size if significant business development opportunities arise during 2023. Novo Nordisk expects to conduct the majority of the new share repurchase programme according to the safe harbour rules in MAR. At the Annual General Meeting in March 2023, the Board of Directors will propose a further reduction in the company's B share capital, corresponding to approximately 1.1% of the total share capital, by cancelling 25 million treasury shares.\n\n## Share price development\n\nFrom end of December 2021 until 30 December 2022, Novo Nordisk's share price increased from DKK 735 to DKK 938, an increase of 27.6%. The total market value of Novo Nordisk's B shares, excluding treasury shares and Novo Holdings A/S shares, was DKK 1,510,514,045,250, as of 30 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nTo be a sustainable business, we must anticipate and adapt to our environment to create new strategic opportunities. Managing risks rigorously and systematically is key in order for us to create and protect value.\n\nWe apply a dual lensed approach to risk management. This means we identify and mitigate both operational risks that pose a threat to our short to medium-term plans, as well as strategic risks that could reduce our ability to realise our corporate strategy over the long-term.\n\n## Addressing risks in our strategic planning\n\nScenario and risk-thinking exercises are part of our strategic planning. They include analyses of market dynamics, climate change, as well as socioeconomic and political developments that present risks or opportunities for our business. Annually, Executive Management and the Board of Directors review a strategic risk profile.\n\n## The main strategic risks are:\n\n## Access and affordability\n\nAccess to affordable care is a global issue as healthcare systems struggle to provide quality care at a sustainable cost, while the burden of chronic diseases keeps rising. Ensuring access and affordability is a risk and responsibility Novo Nordisk shares with all actors involved in healthcare. We recognise that we cannot defeat serious chronic diseases alone but to mitigate the risk, we can accelerate our actions to find solutions in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Innovation and competition\n\nWe are a science-based company whose future depends on raising the innovation bar. To remain competitive in the future and thereby mitigate innovation risk, we invest significantly in internal and external pipeline opportunities to ensure patients receive improved treatments.\n\n## Digital disruption\n\nNew digital technologies could bring new competitors into the pharmaceutical industry. They also provide an opportunity for us to deliver more value to our stakeholders and help patients live a life free from the limitations of their disease. Digital health solutions bring new risks particularly regarding data regulation and privacy, as well as potential quality risks. We strive to monitor and mitigate these risks in close collaboration with relevant partners.\n\n## Production capacity and supply chain risks\n\nDemand fluctuations, resource shortages, geopolitical instability, trade disputes, quality assurance and local manufacturing requirements are all factors that can pressure global supply chains. Furthermore, expanding production\n\ncapacity is complex and associated with a long lead time. Therefore, planning and management of our supply chain and production is key to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Operational risk management process\n\nIn the short- to medium-term, we are exposed to risks throughout our value chain. Some risks are inherent in the pharmaceutical industry, such as delays or failures of potential late-stage medicines in the R&D pipeline. Other risks, such as geopolitical instability, supply disruptions and competitive threats, are well-known to any manufacturing company with global production. We will never compromise on product quality, patient safety or business ethics: these are front and centre of our enterprise-wide risk management set-up. We assess risks to potential financial loss and reputational damage.\n\nExecutive Management, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee review a \"risk grid\" of our biggest operational risks every six months. This grid is based on insights from management teams across the organisation and includes risks that could cause significant disruptions to the business over a three-year horizon. The overview on the next page provides more details of our key risks.\n\n## Key operational risks\n\nAn aggregated illustration of our key operational risks, with associated descriptions, is outlined on the next page.\n\n## For more information\n\nSee our Corporate Governance Report available at www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html",

        "page_content": "## Section 1 Basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1 Principal accounting policies and key accounting estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments, marketable securities and trade receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for all the years presented. The general accounting policies are described in note 5.6.\n\n## Principal accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk's accounting policies are described in each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting policies listed below are regarded as the principal accounting policies applied by Management:\n\n- -  Net sales and rebates (Note 2.1)\n- -  Research and development costs (Note 2.3)\n- -  Income taxes and deferred income taxes (Note 2.6)\n- -  Intangible assets (Note 3.1)\n- -  Provisions and contingent liabilities (Note 3.5)\n- -  Derivative financial instruments (Note 4.4)\n- -  Acquisition of businesses (Note 5.3)\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Given the uncertainties inherent in Novo Nordisk's business activities, Management must make certain estimates regarding valuation and make judgements on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, expenses and related disclosures.\n\nThe key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the measurement of assets and liabilities in the following reporting period. An example being the estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates.\n\nWhen determining estimates and assumptions, Management has assessed the qualitative and quantitative impact of climate related risks. It is Management's assessment that the effect of climate related risks do not significantly impact estimates and assumptions.\n\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. If necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Management considers the key accounting estimates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. The actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes available. In addition, Management makes judgements in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies, for example the classification of a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination.\n\n## Applying materiality\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large numbers of transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes according to their nature or function. The transactions are presented in classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial statements or in the notes.\n\nManagement provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is not applicable or is considered immaterial to the decisionmaking of the primary users of these financial statements.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nManagement has assessed the impact of new or amended accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB and IFRSs endorsed by the European Union effective on or after 1 January 2022. Management assessed that application of these has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2022.\n\nFurthermore, Management has assessed the impact of new or amended accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB that has not yet become effective. Management does not anticipate any significant impact on future periods from the adoption of these amendments.\n\nManagement regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Please refer to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as assumptions applied.\n\n| Key accounting estimates and judgements                                                                       | Risk   | Note(s)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Estimate of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates                                              | High   | 2.1, 3.5  |\n| Estimate in determining the fair value of intangible assets and assessment of impairment of intangible assets | Medium | 3.1, 5.3  |\n| Estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provision for uncertain tax positions                       | Medium | 2.6       |\n| Estimate of ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations                                             | Medium | 3.5       |\n| Judgement of whether a transaction is an asset acquisition or a business combination                          | Low    | 5.3       |",

As such, rebates amount to 75% of gross sales in the US (75% in 2021 and 74% in 2020). Provisions for sales rebates include US Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid, 340B drug pricing program and other US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of European countries and Canada.\n\n## Pricing mechanisms in the US market\n\nIn the US, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans. Key customers in the US include private payers, PBMs and government payers. PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').\n\n## US Managed Care and Medicare\n\nFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of PBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to formulary status or pre-established market share thresholds. Rebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market share information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.\n\n## US wholesaler charge-backs\n\nWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. Chargebacks are estimated using a combination of factors such as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim.\n\nIn January 2021, Novo Nordisk has changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk has recognised revenue related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program to the extent that it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. Please refer to note 3.5 Provisions and contingent liabilities for a more elaborate description of the ongoing litigation related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\n## US Medicaid rebates\n\nMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes in interpretative guidance from government authorities.\n\nNovo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.\n\n## Other US and non-US discounts and sales returns\n\nOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash discounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales returns relate to damaged or expired products.\n\n## Other net sales disclosures\n\nIn 2022, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in the US, representing 19%, 14% and 13% respectively of global net sales (18%, 13% and 13% in 2021 and 19%, 13% and 12% in 2020). Sales to these three wholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease.\n\nNet sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater than 12 months, are expected to be DKK 1,835 million within 12 months (DKK 1,012 million in 2021) and DKK 798 million thereafter (DKK 962 million in 2021).\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note 4.3 for development in key exchange rates.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that Novo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a single point in time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based on the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its goods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for a variety of sales deductions; including product returns as well as rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.\n\nIn some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of future returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in sales. Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis,",

If similar market characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nUnsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain (note 3.5).\n\nWhere absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs that are absolute are netted against trade receivable balances.\n\nThe impact of foreign currency hedging is recognised in the income statement in financial items. Please refer to notes 4.3, 4.4 and 4.10 for more details on hedging.\n\n## Key accounting estimates of sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates\n\nSales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related sales are recorded. These estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and product return obligations require use of significant judgement, as not all conditions are known at the time of sale, for example total sales volume to a given customer. The estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and historical experience. Provisions are calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales for each product as defined by the contracts with the various customer groups. Provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, discounts and returns are processed.\n\nRevenue related to 340B drug pricing program can only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the recognised revenue will not occur. Determining the amount of revenue to recognise requires significant estimation. Management has considered interpretations of applicable laws, whether the consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside Novo Nordisk's influence, as well as the historical claims experience. Please refer to note 3.5 Provisions and contingent liabilities for information on the ongoing litigation related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\nNovo Nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. However, the actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts estimated by Management as more detailed information becomes available.\n\n## 2.2 Segment information\n\n## Business segments - Key figures\n\n|                                                            | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Rare disease   | Rare disease   | Rare disease   | Total    | Total    | Total    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| DKK million                                                | 2022                        | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2022           | 2021           | 2020           | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n| Total net sales                                            | 156,412                     | 121,597                     | 108,020                     | 20,542         | 19,203         | 18,926         | 176,954  | 140,800  | 126,946  |\n| Cost of goods sold                                         | (23,405)                    | (19,363)                    | (17,715)                    | (5,043)        | (4,295)        | (3,217)        | (28,448) | (23,658) | (20,932) |\n| Sales and distribution costs                               | (42,392)                    | (33,791)                    | (29,903)                    | (3,825)        | (3,217)        | (3,025)        | (46,217) | (37,008) | (32,928) |\n| Research and development costs                             | (20,157)                    | (15,600)                    | (13,535)                    | (3,890)        | (2,172)        | (1,927)        | (24,047) | (17,772) | (15,462) |\n| Administrative costs                                       | (3,955)                     | (3,504)                     | (3,387)                     | (512)          | (546)          | (571)          | (4,467)  | (4,050)  | (3,958)  |\n| Other operating income and expenses                        | 892                         | 199                         | 264                         | 142            | 133            | 196            | 1,034    | 332      | 460      |\n| Segment operating profit                                   | 67,395                      | 49,538                      | 43,744                      | 7,414          | 9,106          | 10,382         | 74,809   | 58,644   | 54,126   |\n| Operating margin                                           | 43.1%                       | 40.7%                       | 40.5%                       | 36.1%          | 47.4%          | 54.9%          | 42.3%    | 41.7%    | 42.6%    |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment losses expensed | (5,701)                     | (4,895)                     | (4,624)                     | (1,661)        | (1,130)        | (1,129)        | (7,362)  | (6,025)  | (5,753)  |\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in two business segments based on therapies: Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease (formerly known as Biopharm), representing the entirety of the Group's operations. The activities of the segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing of products within the following areas:\n\n- -   Diabetes and Obesity care: diabetes, obesity and other serious chronic diseases\n- -   Rare disease: rare blood disorders, rare endocrine disorders and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nSegment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit, consistent with the consolidated financial statements. Financial income and expenses and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments. There are no sales or other transactions between the business segments. Costs have generally been split between business segments according to a specific allocation. Certain corporate overhead costs are allocated between segments based on overall allocation keys. Other operating income and expenses have been allocated to the two segments based on the same principle.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Executive Management and the Board of Directors. We consider Executive Management to be the operating decision-making body.\n\n## Geographical areas\n\nIn 2022, Novo Nordisk operated in two main commercial units:\n\n- - International Operations\n- - EMEA: Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n- - China: Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n- - Rest of World: All other countries except for North America.\n- - North America Operations (the US and Canada).\n\nIn 2022, the US contributed with 10% or more of total net sales. In 2021 and 2020 Mainland China also contributed with 10% or more of total net sales. The country of domicile is Denmark, which is part of EMEA. Denmark is immaterial to Novo Nordisk's activities in terms of sales as 99.8% of total sales are realised outside Denmark. Sales are attributed to geographical areas according to the location of the customer.\n\nOut of total property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of DKK 118,087 million (DKK 98,533 million in 2021), DKK 54,492 million is located in Denmark (DKK 46,705 million in 2021) and DKK 44,744 million is located in the US (DKK 41,035 million in 2021) where the majority of production facilities and intangible assets are located.

These methods have played a key role in the development of the production technology used to manufacture insulin, GLP-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human growth hormone. Research activities further utilise new technology platforms including stem cells, gene therapy and RNAi therapies.\n\nResearch and development activities are carried out by Novo Nordisk's research and development centres, mainly in Denmark, the US, the UK and China. Clinical trials are carried out all over the world. Novo Nordisk also enters into partnerships and licence agreements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk expenses all research costs. In line with industry practice, internal and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as they are incurred, due to significant regulatory uncertainties and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products. This means that they do not qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets until marketing approval by a regulatory authority is obtained or considered highly probable. Costs for postapproval activities that are required by authorities as a condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as research and development costs.\n\nResearch and development costs primarily comprise employee costs as well as internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs and facility costs of the research centres. The costs also comprise amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related to intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment used in the research and development activities. Amortisations of intellectual property rights related to marketed products are recognised in cost of goods sold.\n\nThe largest individual type of cost included in Other research and development costs are clinical trial cost.\n\nCertain research and development activities are recognised outside research and development costs:\n\n- - Royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are expensed as cost of goods sold\n- - Royalty income received from partners is recognised as part of other operating income and expenses\n- - Contractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future are disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.\n\n## 2.4 Employee costs\n\n| DKK million                                                                        | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Wages and salaries                                                                 | 34,575  | 28,939  | 26,778  |\n| Share-based payment costs (note 5.1)                                               | 1,539   | 1,040   | 823     |\n| Pensions - defined contribution plans                                              | 2,472   | 2,022   | 1,961   |\n| Pensions - defined benefit plans                                                   | 185     | 139     | 138     |\n| Other social security contributions                                                | 2,713   | 2,203   | 1,862   |\n| Other employee costs                                                               | 3,105   | 2,189   | 2,044   |\n| Total employee costs for the year                                                  | 44,589  | 36,532  | 33,606  |\n| Employee costs capitalised as intangible  assets and property, plant and equipment | (1,451) | (1,240) | (1,279) |\n| Change in employee costs capitalised   as inventories                              | (70)    | (56)    | (60)    |\n| Total employee costs  in the income statement                                      | 43,068  | 35,236  | 32,267  |\n| Included in the income statement:                                                  |         |         |         |\n| Cost of goods sold                                                                 | 11,766  | 9,611   | 8,896   |\n| Sales and distribution costs                                                       | 17,700  | 15,003  | 14,146  |\n| Research and development costs                                                     | 9,952   | 7,328   | 6,269   |\n| Administrative costs                                                               | 3,517   | 3,098   | 2,848   |\n| Other operating income and expenses                                                | 133     | 196     | 108     |\n| Total employee costs in the  income statement                                      | 43,068  | 35,236  | 32,267  |\n\n| Number of employees                    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average number of full-time employees  | 51,046 | 46,171 | 43,759 |\n| Year-end number of full-time employees | 54,393 | 47,792 | 44,723 |\n| Year-end employees (total)             | 55,185 | 48,478 | 45,323 |",

In 2022, paid taxes related to prior years are impacted by a refund of overpaid tax from 2021.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. It also includes adjustments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain tax positions. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income. Provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax receivables and tax payables.\n\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the accounting and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and from realisable tax loss carry-forwards. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in deferred tax assets to the extent that these are expected to be utilised in future taxable income. The deferred income taxes are measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised.\n\nIn general, the Danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. In some countries withholding tax will be applied to dividends paid to Denmark. A provision for withholding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends is planned. The unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to DKK 567 million (DKK 444 million in 2021).\n\nThe value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is recognised as a deferred tax asset until the shares are paid out to the employees. Any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is charged to equity.",

        "page_content": "## Key accounting estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions\n\nManagement has considered future taxable income and has estimated the amount of deferred income tax assets that should be recognised. The estimate is based on an assessment of whether sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. The total tax value of unrecognised tax loss carry-forwards amounts to DKK 456 million in 2022 (DKK 166 million in 2021).\n\nIn the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur. Management has estimated the expected outcome of the disputes by using the 'most probable outcome'-method to determine the provisions for uncertain tax positions. Management considers the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\n## Development in deferred income tax assets and liabilities\n\n| DKK million                                       | Property,  plant and  equipment   | Intangible  assets   | Inventories   | Liabilities   | Other   | Offset  within  countries   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|---------|\n| 2022                                              |                                   |                      |               |               |         |                             |         |\n| Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 1 January   | (1,980)                           | (7,375)              | 3,195         | 6,932         | 2,629   | -

        "page_content": "## 2021 additions\n\nAdditions from acquisition of businesses relates to Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which primarily includes the RNAi research technology platform and pipeline assets, which are recognised within intellectual property rights and goodwill; please refer to note 5.3.\n\nIn 2021, Novo Nordisk acquired Prothena's wholly-owned subsidiary Neotope Neuroscience Ltd. and thereby gained full worldwide rights to the intellectual property rights of Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis business and pipeline cover. The acquisition included the clinical stage antibody PRX004. PRX004 is an antibody that uses a depleter mechanism that has the potential to improve heart failure symptoms and reverse the disease progression within the ATTR-CM diseases. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition recognised in intellectual property rights, all related to PRX004.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\n\nIn 2022, an impairment loss of DKK 760 million (DKK 573 million in 2021) was recognised, all related to intellectual property rights. DKK 250 million (DKK 436 million in 2021) of the impairment was related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment and DKK 510 million (DKK 137 million in 2021) was related to Rare disease. The entire impairment loss in 2022 was recognised in research and development costs (DKK 573 million in research and development costs in 2021). The impairment was a result of Management's review of expectations related to intellectual property rights not yet in use.\n\nNo impairment related to marketable products was identified in 2022 or in 2021.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, goodwill is allocated to the segments Diabetes and Obesity care (DKK 4,154 million) and Rare diseases (DKK 938 million). At 31 December 2021, goodwill from the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc was unallocated as the purchase price allocation for the acquisition was provisional. As of 31 December 2022, goodwill from the acquisition of Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. is allocated to Rare disease based on a provisional purchase price allocation. No impairment of goodwill was recognised in 2022 or 2021 as the annual impairment test showed that the estimated recoverable amount in the forecast period exceeded the carrying amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill was allocated.\n\nGoodwill is monitored for impairment at the operating segment level, which is the lowest level CGU to which consolidated goodwill is allocated and monitored by Management. CGUs are therefore defined as Novo Nordisk's business segments, Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease. Fair value less costs of disposal is estimated using an income-approach and is based\n\non discounted cash flow projections. The applied post-tax discount rates for Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare diseases are 7.0% (Pre-tax discount rate of 8.3%). Cash flow projections are based on budgets approved by management. The forecast period for Diabetes and Obesity care, and Rare diseases is 9 years. The discounted cash flows from the forecast period significantly exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\nThe key assumptions and sensitivities are Novo Nordisk's volume market share, growth rates, pricing, development of new markets and the success rate for introducing new products and treatments. Sensitivities are affected by external factors such as market- and generic competition, and price regulation.\n\nThe value assigned to key assumptions reflects past experience adjusted for market specific risks or expected changes. Fair value is determined using largely unobservable inputs.\n\n## Other intangible assets disclosures\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use amount to DKK 28,013 million (DKK 22,690 million in 2021), primarily intellectual property rights and goodwill.\n\nIntellectual property rights include DKK 5,546 million provisionally allocated to Etavopivat (please refer to note 5.3), DKK 4,648 million related to Ziltivekimab (DKK 4,612 million in 2021) and DKK 3,704 million related to Nedosiran (DKK 3,854 million in 2021), all of which are intangible assets under development.\n\nIn addition, intellectual property rights contain DKK 6,584 million related to Rybelsus (DKK 7,150 million in 2021), which has a remaining useful life of 12 years (13 years in 2021); and DKK 10,251 million (DKK 10,135 million in 2021) related to the RNAi technology platform, with a remaining useful life of 22 years (23 years in 2021).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Research and development projects\n\nInternal and subcontracted research costs are fully charged to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Consistent with industry practice, development costs are also expensed until regulatory approval is obtained or is probable; please refer to note 2.3. Payments to third parties under collaboration and licence agreements are assessed for the substance of their nature. Payments which represent subcontracted research and development work are expensed as the services are received. Payments which represent rights to the transfer of intellectual property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.\n\nFor acquired research and development projects, and intellectual property rights, the likelihood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the asset, and thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to be satisfied. As the cost of acquired research and development projects can often be measured reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as intangible assets on acquisition. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 trials) are accrued and capitalised into the cost of the intangible asset when the achievement of the event is probable. Development costs incurred subsequent to acquisition are treated consistently with internal project development costs.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost, and are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Impairment tests are based on Management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products. Goodwill is allocated to operating segments based on expected future cash flow from products utilizing the synergies and knowhow acquired.\n\nFor intellectual property rights acquired for research and development projects, upfront fees and acquisition costs are capitalised as the historical cost. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event will be capitalised when the contingent event is probable of being achieved. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.\n\nAmortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. This corresponds to the legal duration or the economic useful life depending on which is shorter, and not exceeding 25 years in either case. The amortisation of intellectual property rights commences after regulatory approval has been obtained or when assets are put in use.\n\nAmortisation of software is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 3-15 years. The amortisation commences when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.",

They are tested annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Impairment tests are based on Management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products.\n\nAssets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include the following:\n\n- - Development of a competing drug\n- - Realised sales trending below predicted sales\n- - Changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement policies\n- - Inconsistent or unfavourable clinical readouts\n- - Changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences\n- - Advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments\n- - Adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names\n- - Changes in the economic lives of similar assets\n- - Relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment.\n\nIf the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of an impairment, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments on intangible assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements on intangible assets\n\nImpairment tests are based on management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products.\n\nWhen collaboration agreements contain elements of acquisition of intangible assets and research and development activities to be performed by the counterpart, management estimates the allocation of payments that should be deferred to the acquisition of intangible assets and prepaid research and development activities respectively.\n\n## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment\n\n| DKK million                                                              | Land and  buildings   | Plant and  machinery   | Other  equipment   | Assets   under   construction   | Property,  plant and  equipment   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2022                                                                     |                       |                        |                    |                                 |                                   |\n| Cost at the beginning of the year                                        | 41,076                | 35,944                 | 7,776              | 11,091                          | 95,887                            |\n| Additions from acquisition of businesses (note 5.3)                      | 297                   | 2                      | 14                 | -

The investments will establish additional capacity across the entire global value chain from manufacturing of API to assembly and packaging, with the vast majority being invested in API capacity. These expansions will provide capacity for the production of Novo Nordisk's current and future oral and injectable products.\n\n## Leased property, plant and equipment\n\n| DKK million        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Land and buildings | 3,544  | 3,340  |\n| Other equipment    | 587    | 499    |\n| Total              | 4,131  | 3,839  |\n\nNovo Nordisk mainly leases office buildings, warehouses, laboratories and vehicles. The right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment and the lease liability in borrowings. In 2022, the total amount recognised in the income statement related to leases was DKK 1,491 million (DKK 1,303 million in 2021). The total cash outflow for leases amounted to DKK 1,438 million (DKK 1,275 million in 2021). As of 31 December 2022, the lease liability excludes potential lease payments of DKK 3,723 million (undiscounted) related to optional lease term extension rights on properties that were not considered reasonably certain to be exercised (DKK 2,209 million in 2021). Please refer to note 4.5 for a maturity analysis of lease payments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciations and any impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes costs directly attributable to the construction of the assets. Any subsequent cost is included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Novo Nordisk, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years and other equipment: 3-10 years. Land is not depreciated).\n\nThe depreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. If an asset's carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are expensed. However, plant and equipment with an alternative use or used for general research and development purposes are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life as research and development costs.\n\nFor contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses.\n\nThe lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain to be exercised. For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen leases), the Group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination period if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period. If the lease liability is remeasured due to a change in future lease payments a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been fully depreciated. For a description of accounting policies for lease liabilities, please refer to note 4.9.\n\n## 3.3 Inventories\n\n| DKK million                                                                 | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Raw materials                                                               | 6,392   | 4,310   |\n| Work in progress                                                            | 13,673  | 12,285  |\n| Finished goods                                                              | 6,038   | 5,282   |\n| Total inventories (gross)                                                   | 26,103  | 21,877  |\n| Write-downs at year-end                                                     | (1,715) | (2,256) |\n| Total inventories (net)                                                     | 24,388  | 19,621  |\n| Indirect production costs included in work in   progress and finished goods | 10,640  | 8,929   |\n| Share of total inventories (net)                                            | 44%     | 46%     |\n| Movements in inventory write-downs:                                         |         |         |\n| Write-downs at the beginning of the year                                    | 2,256   | 2,153   |\n| Write-downs during the year                                                 | 1,110   | 883     |\n| Utilisation of write-downs                                                  | (1,482) | (661)   |\n| Reversal of write-downs                                                     | (169)   | (119)   |\n| Write-downs at the end of the year                                          | 1,715   | 2,256   |\n\nAll write-downs in both 2022 and 2021 relate to fully impaired inventory.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost comprises direct production costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour. Production costs for work in progress and finished goods include indirect production costs such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance, etc. If the expected sales price less completion costs to execute sales (net realisable value) is lower than the carrying amount, a write-down is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its net realisable value.\n\nInventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capitalised but immediately written down, until there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. The cost is recognised in the income statement as research and development costs. Once there is a high probability of regulatory approval being obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.",

These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. The country risk ratings in 2022 have overall remained unchanged from 2021.\n\nNo loss allowance has been recognised on trade receivables in factoring portfolios in 2022 and 2021. Please refer to note 4.3 for more info on the trade receivable programmes.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The split of trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the location of the customer.\n\nBefore being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement under sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.\n\nManagement makes allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of goods. Loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical risk and specific customer knowledge. The allowance is based on a provision matrix on days past due and a forward looking element relating mainly to incorporation of Dun & Bradstreet country risk ratings and an individual assessment. Please refer to note 4.3 for a general description of credit risk.",

For non-current liabilities, provisions for sales rebates are expected to be settled after one year, provisions for product returns will be utilised in 2023 and 2024. In the case of provisions for legal disputes, the timing of settlement cannot be determined.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently involved in pending litigations, claims and investigations arising out of the normal conduct of its business. While provisions that Management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been made for probable losses, there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates.\n\n## Pending litigation against Novo Nordisk\n\nIn January 2021, Novo Nordisk made changes to its policy in the US related to facilitating delivery of its discounted medicines to commercial pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk is currently engaged in litigation against the government seeking a declaration that its 340B policy is consistent with relevant US laws. On 30 January 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling holding that Novo Nordisk's drug distribution policy meets the requirements of the 340B statute. This ruling, as well as other expected rulings in related matters pending before the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and DC Circuits, may be subject to further discretionary appellate review before the US Supreme Court. Depending on the outcome of any subsequent appeals in this and related matters, there may be a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, net sales and cash flow.\n\nMosaic Health Inc. and Central Virginia Health Services, Inc. (both 340B covered entities) filed a putative class action lawsuit in NY Federal Court against Novo Nordisk US, Eli Lilly, Sanofi and AstraZeneca alleging a conspiracy among the manufacturers to artificially fix prices of diabetes medications through changes to their policies relating to the distribution of 340B drugs through contract pharmacy arrangements. The lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the Court on 2 September 2022, and the plaintiffs have sought leave to file an amended complaint. Novo Nordisk does not expect this matter to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently defending fourteen lawsuits, including three putative class actions, relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines. Four of these cases are pending in New Jersey federal court; four are pending in federal courts in Mississippi, Arkansas, Montana and New York and the remaining six are pending in state courts in Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, California, Missouri and Puerto Rico. All pending matters also name as defendants Eli Lilly and Company and Sanofi, while certain matters also name Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and related entities. Plaintiffs generally allege that the manufacturers and PBMs colluded to artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes products, while offering reduced prices to PBMs through rebates used to secure formulary access. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nIn 2016, Novo Nordisk US received a Civil Investigative Demand from the US Department of Justice ('DOJ CID') relating to potential off-label marketing of NovoSeven \u00ae (including high dose and for prophylactic use) and interactions with physicians and patients. The DOJ investigation was likely prompted by a lawsuit filed in 2015 by a former Novo Nordisk US employee (the 'Relator') in the Western District of Oklahoma. Relator alleges Novo Nordisk US caused the submission of false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and private insurers in California as a result of the same conduct that was the subject of the DOJ CID. In 2019, the DOJ and 28 state AGs declined to intervene in the Relator's lawsuit. The State of Washington chose to intervene, and a consolidated complaint was filed and unsealed by the court on 28 May 2020. Novo Nordisk moved to dismiss the complaint, which resulted in certain claims being dismissed and certain claims remaining at this stage of the case. This matter is in the early stages of discovery and Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nPending claims against Novo Nordisk and Investigations involving Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk US has received Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or subpoenas from several US authorities including Attorneys General from the states of Washington, New Mexico, New York, Colorado, Vermont, Illinois, Texas, Ohio and the US Federal Trade Commission that call for the production of documents and information relating to, among other things, the company's trade practices relating to its insulin and GLP-1 products. Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the relevant government authorities in each of these investigative matters and does not expect these matters to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nIn December 2021, Novo Nordisk US received a CID from the United States Department of Justice relating to the company's financial relationships with healthcare professional and prescriptions for Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae during the period of 1 January 2016 to present. Novo Nordisk is cooperating with Department of Justice in this investigation and does not expect this matter to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nNovo Nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received requests for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products from several committees of the Unites States House of Representatives and/or United States Senate. Novo Nordisk has responded to the various committees in response to their requests. Novo Nordisk does not expect the inquiries to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.",

In the opinion of Management, neither settlement nor continuation of such proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to have a material effect on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. Provisions are calculated based on Management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Please refer to note 2.1 for further information on sales rebates and provisions.\n\nProvisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, Novo Nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated expenditure for settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision for interest is recognised as a financial expense.\n\nNovo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is recorded. The provision is measured at gross sales value.\n\n## Key accounting estimates regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations\n\nProvisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provisions linked to ongoing legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and potential future litigation outcomes. These are by nature dependent on inherently uncertain future events. When determining likely outcomes of litigation, etc., Management considers the input of external counsel on each case, as well as known outcomes in case law. Although Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material.",

Treasury shares are primarily acquired to reduce the company's share capital. In addition, a limited part is used to finance Novo Nordisk's long-term share-based incentive programme and restricted stock units to employees. Treasury shares are deducted from the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of DKK 0.2 per share. Differences between this amount and the amount paid to acquire or received for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in retained earnings.\n\nThe purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining part of the 2021 share repurchase programme, totalling DKK 1.6 billion and the DKK 24 billion Novo Nordisk B share repurchase programme for 2022, of which DKK 1.5 billion was outstanding at year-end. The programme ended on 30 January 2023.\n\n## Specification of Other reserves\n\n| DKK million                           | Exchange  rate ad-  justments   | Cash flow  hedges   | Tax and  other  items   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| 2020                                  |                                 |                     |                         |         |\n| Reserve at the  beginning of the year | (839)                           | (329)               | 474                     | (694)   |\n| Other comprehensive  income, net      | (1,689)                         | 1,713               | (567)                   | (543)   |\n| Transferred to  intangible assets     | -                               | 418                 | (92)                    | 326     |\n| Reserve at the end   of the year      | (2,528)                         | 1,802               | (185)                   | (911)   |\n| 2021                                  |                                 |                     |                         |         |\n| Other comprehensive  income, net      | 1,624                           | (3,557)             | 1,117                   | (816)   |\n| Transferred to  intangible assets     | -                               | 15                  | (2)                     | 13      |\n| Reserve at the end   of the year      | (904)                           | (1,740)             | 930                     | (1,714) |\n| 2022                                  |                                 |                     |                         |         |\n| Other comprehensive  income, net      | 2,289                           | 2,766               | (892)                   | 4,163   |\n| Reserve at the end   of the year      | 1,385                           | 1,026               | 38                      | 2,449   |\n\nAccording to Danish corporate law, reserves available for distribution as dividends are based on the financial statements of the parent company, Novo Nordisk A/S.

        "page_content": "## 4.3 Financial risks\n\nManagement has assessed the following key financial risks:\n\n| Type                  | Financial risk   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Foreign exchange risk | High             |\n| Credit risk           | Low              |\n| Interest rate risk    | Low              |\n| Liquidity risk        | Low              |\n\nNovo Nordisk has a centralised management of the Group's financial risks. The overall objectives and policies for the company's financial risk management are outlined in the internal Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Treasury Policy consists of the Foreign Exchange Policy, the Investment Policy, the Financing Policy and the Policy regarding Credit Risk on Financial Counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial instruments and risk limits.\n\nNovo Nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Novo Nordisk uses a fully integrated treasury management system to manage all financial positions, and all positions are marked-to-market.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The majority of Novo Nordisk's sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY and CAD, while the EUR exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy towards EUR.\n\nThe overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results. Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. The currency hedging strategy balances risk reduction and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options matching the due dates of the hedged items. Expected cash flows are continually assessed using historical inflows, budgets and monthly sales forecasts.\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items.\n\n## Key currencies\n\n|                                              | USD                                          | CNY                                          | JPY                                          | CAD                                          | GBP                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  |\n| 2022                                         | 708                                          | 105                                          | 5.40                                         | 543                                          | 873                                          |\n| 2021                                         | 629                                          | 97                                           | 5.73                                         | 502                                          | 865                                          |\n| 2020                                         | 654                                          | 95                                           | 6.13                                         | 488                                          | 839                                          |\n| Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) |\n| 2022                                         | 697                                          | 101                                          | 5.29                                         | 515                                          | 838                                          |\n| 2021                                         | 657                                          | 103                                          | 5.70                                         | 517                                          | 885                                          |\n| 2020                                         | 606                                          | 93                                           | 5.88                                         | 474                                          | 824                                          |\n\nForeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis\n\nAt year-end, an immediate 5% decrease in the disclosed currencies versus DKK and EUR is estimated by Management to have the following impact on Novo Nordisk's operating profit for the next 12 months.\n\n## Sensitivity on operating profit of an immediate 5% decrease in key currencies 1\n\n|   DKK million | USD     | CNY   | JPY   | CAD   | GBP   |\n|---------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|          2023 | (3,180) | (500) | (240) | (320) | (160) |\n|          2022 | (2,350) | (360) | (230) | (200) | (120) |\n\n- 1.

In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 52,714 million (DKK 43,425 million in 2021). Please refer to note 4.9 for details of the Group's total financial assets.\n\nTo manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating\n\nfrom at least two out of the three selected rating agencies: Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk. The credit risk on marketable securities is low, as investments are made in highly liquid bonds with predominantly AAA credit ratings.\n\n## Credit risk exposure to non-financial counterparties\n\nOutside the US, Novo Nordisk has no significant concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables or other receivables and prepayments, as the exposure in general is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. In the US, the three major wholesalers account for a large proportion of total net sales, see note 2.1. However, US wholesaler credit ratings are monitored, and part of the trade receivables are sold on full nonrecourse terms; see below for details.\n\nNovo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate. These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. The country risk ratings in 2022 have overall remained unchanged from 2021 to 2022.\n\n## Trade receivable programmes\n\nAt year-end, the Group had derecognised receivables without recourse having due dates after 31 December 2022 amounting to:\n\n| DKK million   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| US            | 1,394  | 1,313  | 1,817  |\n| Japan         | 2,273  | 2,453  | 2,351  |\n\nNovo Nordisk's subsidiaries in the US and Japan employ trade receivable programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms to optimise working capital.\n\nPlease refer to note 3.4 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by geographical segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNovo Nordisk's exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be low due to the capital structure. Non-current debt consists of fixed rate instruments. Interest rate risk on marketable securities of DKK 10,921 million is considered low due to a low portfolio duration.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe liquidity risk is considered to be low. Novo Nordisk ensures the availability of the required liquidity through a combination of cash management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both uncommitted and committed credit facilities. Novo Nordisk uses cash pools for optimisation and centralisation of cash management.\n\nFinancial reserves comprise the sum of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year, marketable securities with original term to maturity exceeding three months and undrawn committed credit and loan facilities, with a maturity of more than 12 months, less loans and bank overdrafts classified as liabilities arising from financing activities contractually obliged for repayment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Financial reserves\n\n| DKK million                           | 2022   | 2021     | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents  (note 4.6) | 12,653 | 10,719   | 12,226 |\n| Marketable securities                 | 10,921 | 6,765    | -      |\n| Undrawn committed credit facility 4   | 11,527 | 11,526   | 11,531 |\n| Undrawn bridge facility 5             | -      | -        | 5,577  |\n| Borrowings (Note 4.5)                 | (480)  | (12,861) | (576)  |\n| Financial reserves                    | 34,621 | 16,149   | 28,758 |\n\n- 4.  The undrawn committed credit facility comprises a EUR 1,550 million facility (EUR 1,550 million in 2021 and EUR 1,550 million in 2020) committed by a portfolio of international banks. The facility matures in 2025.\n- 5.  For 2020, the undrawn bridge facility comprises the EUR 750 million (DKK 5,577 million) undrawn portion of EUR 1,500 million bridge facility.",

Average hedge rate for USD cash flow hedges is 696 at the end of 2022 (628 at the end of 2021) and average hedge rate for USD fair value hedges is 714 at the end of 2022 (628 at the end of 2021).\n\nThe fair value of cash flow hedges at year-end 2022, a gain of DKK 1,026 million, has been recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses. There is no expected ineffectiveness at 31 December 2022, primarily because hedging instruments match currencies of hedged cash flows.\n\n## Use of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to foreign exchange risk. None of the derivatives are held for trading. Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities.\n\nNet investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOn initiation of the contract, Novo Nordisk designates each derivative financial contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:\n\n- - hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)\n- -  hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).\n\nAll contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nValue adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nValue adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative value adjustment of these contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable nonfinancial asset purchases, the cumulative value adjustments are transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the asset when recognised.\n\n## Discontinuance of cash flow hedging\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement under financial income or financial expenses.\n\nFor additional disclosures on accounting policies for financial instruments please refer to note 4.9.",

Includes additions from acquisitions of businesses.\n\n## Eurobonds\n\nIn 2022, three tranches with aggregate principal amount of EUR 1.5 billion corresponding to DKK 11.1 billion were launched under the programme. Net proceeds of the issuances have been used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of the bridge loan facility established in connection with Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2021. In 2021, two tranches with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1.3 billion corresponding to DKK 9.7 billion were launched. Net proceeds of the issuances have been used by Novo Nordisk for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of the bridge loan facility established in connection with Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Emisphere Technologies Inc. in 2020. Issued Eurobonds are listed on Euronext Dublin. The total fair value of issued Eurobonds amounts to DKK 18.7 billion (DKK 9.6 billion in 2021).\n\n## Sale and repurchase agreement\n\nIn 2021, as part of bridge funding the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk entered into a sale and repurchase agreement of marketable securities (REPO). On 31 December 2021, the carrying amount of the assets transferred was DKK 5,937 million, and the associated liabilities amounted to DKK 5,937 million. The repurchase was fixed, and Novo Nordisk therefore retained full exposure from fair value changes of the marketable securities. Therefore, the transaction was treated as a collateralised lending arrangement. The marketable securities were repurchased in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nThe lease liabilities are related to IFRS 16 leases, primarily for premises and company cars and include the present value of future lease payments during the lease term. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured to reflect changes in future lease payments, e.g. changes in lease terms. Issued bonds, loans and bank overdrafts are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds received less transaction costs. In subsequent periods these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds received and the nominal value is recognised in financial income or financial expenses over the term of the loan. Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained in financial assets that have been transferred, the assets are not derecognised and the proceeds obtained are recognised as a financial liability. For fair value determination please refer to note 4.9.\n\n## 4.6 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## 4.7 Other non-cash items\n\n| DKK million               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at bank (note 4.3)   | 12,653 | 10,720 | 12,757 |\n| Borrowings 1  (note 4.5)  | -      | (1)    | (531)  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 12,653 | 10,719 | 12,226 |\n\n- 1.

The restricted cash balance relates to subsidiaries in which availability of currency for remittance of funds is temporarily scarce.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nCash and cash equivalents consists of cash offset by short-term bank overdrafts. Where short-term bank overdrafts are consistently overdrawn, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.

Other financial assets at amortised cost include DKK 433 million which are due in more than five years (DKK 335 million in 2021). Other financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement are minor shareholdings.\n\n## Fair value measurement hierarchy\n\n| DKK million                                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Active market data                            | 11,288 | 7,169  |\n| Directly or indirectly observable market data | 2,727  | 1,690  |\n| Not based on observable market data           | 34,159 | 25,756 |\n| Total financial assets at fair value          | 48,174 | 34,615 |\n| Active market data                            | -      | -      |\n| Directly or indirectly observable market data | 2,903  | 2,184  |\n| Not based on observable market data           | -      | -      |\n| Total financial liabilities at fair value     | 2,903  | 2,184  |\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be categorised using the fair value measurement hierarchy above. There were no transfers between the 'Active market data' and 'Directly or indirectly observable market data' categories during 2022 or 2021. Disclosed fair value of issued Eurobonds are based on 'Active market data'. There are no significant intangible assets or items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value. For a description of the credit quality of financial assets such as trade receivables, cash at bank, current debt and derivative financial instruments, please refer to notes 4.3 and 4.4.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDepending on purpose, Novo Nordisk classifies financial instruments into the following categories:\n\n- - Financial assets at fair value through the income statement\n- - Financial assets used as hedging instruments\n- - Financial assets at amortised cost\n- - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n- - Financial liabilities used as hedging instruments\n- - Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\nManagement determines the classification of its financial instruments on initial recognition and re-evaluates this at the end of every reporting period to the extent that such a classification is permitted or required.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement consist of equity investments and marketable securities. These financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Equity investments are included in other financial assets. Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of equity instruments and marketable securities are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. For a description of accounting policies on derivative financial instruments designated to hedge accounting, please refer to note 4.4.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade receivables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative financial assets solely with payments of principal and interest. Novo Nordisk normally 'holds-to-collect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash flows. If collection is expected within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. These are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs, except for trade receivables that are initially measured at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. For a description of accounting policies on trade receivables, please refer to note 3.4.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date. Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and Novo Nordisk has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through the income statement consist of financial derivative instruments.\n\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost consist of borrowings (loans, issued Eurobonds, bank overdrafts and lease liabilities), trade payables and other liabilities (primarily employee cost payables, payables related to non-current assets, sales rebates as well as deferred revenue). Other liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables related to non-current assets, sales rebates as well as deferred revenue. These are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds received less transaction costs. The difference between the proceeds received and the nominal value is recognised in financial expenses over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. For initial recognition of lease liabilities refer to note 4.5.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is repaid, cancelled or expires.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value measurement\n\nIf an active market exists, the fair value of a financial instrument is based on the most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period. If a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, Novo Nordisk bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. Adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for instance by including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed to be motivated by normal business considerations. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nFinancial assets for which no active market exists are carried at fair value based on a valuation methodology. The fair value of such financial instruments are determined on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. The fair value of standard and simple financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to generally accepted valuation techniques. Market-based input are used to measure the fair value.\n\nThe fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring entity. The factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. Inputs into the estimate of US wholesaler charge-backs are described in note 2.1.\n\n## 4.10 Financial income and expenses\n\n## Financial income\n\n| DKK million                                  | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Financial income                             |        |        |        |\n| Interest income 1                            | 239    | 231    | 337    |\n| Foreign exchange gain (net)                  | -      | -      | 1,142  |\n| Financial gain from forward  contracts (net) | -      | 2,316  | -      |\n| Capital gain on investments, etc.            | -      | 340    | -      |\n| Result of associated companies               | -      | -      | 149    |\n| Total financial income                       | 239    | 2,887  | 1,628  |\n| Financial expenses                           |        |        |        |\n| Interest expenses 1                          | 378    | 289    | 390    |\n| Foreign exchange loss (net)                  | 2,885  | 1,972  | -      |\n| Financial loss from forward  contracts (net) | 1,766  | -      | 1,889  |\n| Capital loss on investments, etc.            | 124    | -      | 195    |\n| Capital loss on marketable  securities       | 463    | 44     | -      |\n| Result of associated companies               | 189    | 24     | -      |\n| Other financial expenses                     | 181    | 122    | 150    |\n| Total financial expenses                     | 5,986  | 2,451  | 2,624  |\n\n- 1.

In 2021, Novo Nordisk introduced a new share-based compensation programme with terms, which amortises the grant date valuation over three years (2019 and 2020 programmes  were amortised over four years). The 2022 expense includes amortisation of the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 programmes.\n\n## Restricted stock units to employees\n\nIn appreciation of the efforts of employees during recent years, as of 1 August 2019, all employees in the company were offered 75 restricted stock units. A restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one Novo Nordisk B share free of charge in February 2023, subject to continued employment. The cost of the DKK 660 million programme is amortised over the vesting period.\n\n## Long-term share-based incentive programme\n\nManagement Board\n\nOn 31 January 2023, the Board of Directors approved an interim allocation of 0.4 million Novo Nordisk B shares to the members of the Management Board for the 2022 financial year. The number of shares is periodically estimated based on long-term incentive performance. The final number of shares allocated for the 2022 programme is to be decided at the end of the performance period in 2024. The value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) was DKK 234 million.\n\nThe cost of the 2022 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2022-2024 at an annual amount of DKK 78 million.

The number of shares for Management Board and management group below Management Board has been adjusted as the targets set by the Board are expected to be exceeded for the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 programmes.\n\nThe grant date of the programme was February 2022, and the share price used for the determining the grant date fair value of the award was the average share price for Novo Nordisk B shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the period 2-16 February 2022, adjusted for the expected dividend (DKK 639). Based on the split of participants when the share allocation was decided, 47% of the allocated shares will be allocated to members of Executive Management and 53% to other members of the Management Board.\n\nThe shares allocated for 2019 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2022 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2022 full-year financial results on 1 February 2023. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 152 million, expensed over the vesting period of 20192022. The number of shares to be transferred (0.6 million shares) is higher than the original number of shares allocated, as the average sales growth in the three-year vesting period was above the maximum performance target set by the Board and consequently, the number of shares increased by 30%.\n\nAll restricted stock units and shares allocated to Management are settled by treasury shares at the time of vesting.",

For 2022, a total of 1.7 million shares have currently been allocated to this group, corresponding to a value at launch of the programme adjusted for expected dividends of DKK 1,062 million. The number of shares is periodically estimated based on long-term incentive performance. The final number of shares allocated for the 2022 programme is decided at the end of the performance period in 2024. The cost of the 2022 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2022-2024 at an annual amount of DKK 354 million. Financial targets are set by the Board for a three-year period, while every year the Board sets the non-financial targets.\n\nThe shares allocated for 2019 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2022 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2022 full-year financial results on 1 February 2023. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 387 million amortised over the period 2019-2022. The number of shares to be transferred (1.5 million shares) is higher than the original number of shares allocated, as the average sales growth in the threeyear vesting period was above the maximum performance target set by the Board and consequently the number of shares increased by 30%.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nShare-based compensation\n\nNovo Nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.\n\nThe total amount to be expensed over the performance and vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is fixed at the grant date, and adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, Novo Nordisk revises its estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. Novo Nordisk recognises the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the income statement and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in proceeds) over the remaining vesting period. Adjustments relating to prior years are included in the income statement in the year of adjustment.\n\n## 5.2 Commitments\n\n## Contractual obligations not recognised in the balance sheet\n\n| DKK million (Undiscounted)                                                       | Current   | Non- current   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| 2022                                                                             |           |                |         |\n| Leases 1                                                                         | 205       | 1,641          | 1,846   |\n| Research and development obligations                                             | 5,988     | 7,582          | 13,570  |\n| Research and development -   potential milestone payments 2                      | 376       | 5,011          | 5,387   |\n| Commercial product launch -   potential milestone payments 2                     | -         | 7,598          | 7,598   |\n| Purchase obligations relating to  investments in property, plant   and equipment | 1,696     | 1,427          | 3,123   |\n| Other purchase obligations                                                       | 18,762    | 14,366         | 33,128  |\n| Total obligations not recognised   in the balance sheet                          | 27,027    | 37,625         | 64,652  |\n| 2021                                                                             |           |                |         |\n| Leases 1                                                                         | 145       | 636            | 781     |\n| Research and development obligations                                             | 4,196     | 6,357          | 10,553  |\n| Research and development -   potential milestone payments 2                      | 771       | 4,220          | 4,991   |\n| Commercial product launch -   potential milestone payments 2                     | -         | 5,966          | 5,966   |\n| Purchase obligations relating to  investments in property, plant   and equipment | 545       | -              | 545     |\n| Other purchase obligations                                                       | 13,407    | 5,998          | 19,405  |\n| Total obligations not recognised   in the balance sheet                          | 19,064    | 23,177         | 42,241  |",

        "page_content": "## Contractual obligations\n\nResearch and development obligations include contingent payments related to achieving development milestones. Such amounts entail uncertainties in relation to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of the obligations are dependent on milestone achievements. Exercise fees and subsequent milestone payments under in-licensing option agreements are excluded, as Novo Nordisk is not contractually obligated to make such payments. Commercial product launch milestones include contingent payments solely related to achievement of a commercial product launch following regulatory approval.\n\nCommercial milestones, royalties and other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual commitments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future sales.\n\nThe purchase obligations related to investments in property, plant and equipment primarily relates to production capacity expansion projects. Novo Nordisk expects to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.\n\nThe contractual obligations not recognised in the balance sheet represent contractual payments and are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted.\n\n## Other guarantees\n\nOther guarantees amount to DKK 1,222 million (DKK 1,251 million in 2021). Other guarantees primarily relate to performance guarantees issued by Novo Nordisk.\n\n## 5.3 Acquisition of businesses\n\n## Fair value recognised at date of acquisition\n\n| DKK million                             | 2022 Forma  Thera-  peutics   | 2021 Dicerna  Pharma- ceuticals   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Intellectual property rights            | 5,766                         | 18,687                            |\n| Other intangible assets                 | 492                           | 24                                |\n| Financial assets                        | 77                            | 31                                |\n| Marketable securities                   | 1,470                         | 861                               |\n| Cash                                    | 1,027                         | 3,033                             |\n| Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net  | (1,233)                       | (3,480)                           |\n| Other net assets                        | (21)                          | (1,468)                           |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired        | 7,578                         | 17,688                            |\n| Goodwill                                | 524                           | 4,346                             |\n| Purchase price                          | 8,102                         | 22,034                            |\n| Settlement of pre-existing relationship | -                             | (145)                             |\n| Fair value of existing shareholdings    | -                             | (573)                             |\n| Consideration transferred               | 8,102                         | 21,316                            |\n| Cash acquired                           | (1,027)                       | (3,033)                           |\n| Cash used for acquisition of businesses | 7,075                         | 18,283                            |\n\n## Business combinations in 2022\n\nOn 14 October 2022, Novo Nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of the publicly held US company Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. at a price of 20 USD per share via a cash tender offer, equal to a total purchase price of DKK 8,102 million. Novo Nordisk had no pre-acquisition ownership stake in, or pre-existing collaboration with Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\n\n## About Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\n\nForma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., including its two fully owned subsidiaries Forma Therapeutics, Inc. and Forma Securities Corp, (Collectively Forma Therapeutics) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to transform the lives of patients with rare haematological diseases.\n\n## Strategic rationale\n\nThe acquisition of Forma Therapeutics, including its lead development candidate, etavopivat, is aligned with Novo Nordisk's strategy to complement and accelerate its scientific presence and pipeline in haemoglobinopathies, a group of disorders in which there is abnormal production or structure of the haemoglobin protein in the red blood cells. Etavopivat, an investigational oral, once-daily, selective pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) activator, is being developed to improve anaemia and red blood cell health in people with sickle cell disease (SCD), a seriously debilitating, life-threatening and life shortening disease.\n\n## Details of the acquisition\n\nThe purchase price allocated to goodwill, intellectual property rights, other intangible assets, and deferred tax assets and liabilities, is considered provisional due to uncertainty on key assumptions which require detailed analysis which has not been possible to conclude as of 31 December 2022. Adjustments may be applied to the purchase price allocation for a period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the highly-skilled workforce in place at Forma Therapeutics. The goodwill is fully allocated to the rare disease business segment and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nTransaction costs of DKK 51 million are included in other operating income and expenses in the income statement for 2022.",

Before the acquisition, Novo Nordisk held 2.9% of the shares in Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at a fair value of DKK 573 million.\n\nThe total purchase price amounts to DKK 22,034 million, which has been settled by the fair value of existing shareholdings of DKK 573 million, settlement of a pre-existing relationship of DKK 145 million and a cash consideration of DKK 21,316 million.\n\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the highly-skilled workforce and expected synergies generated from Novo Nordisk's know-how and commercialisation abilities within protein and peptide based medicines and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s know-how within RNAi technology. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nTransaction costs of DKK 124 million are included in other operating income and expenses in the income statement for 2021.\n\nAt end of 2021, the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was provisional. The allocation was finalised in 2022 without any adjustments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations.\n\nThe purchase price for a business comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred to the former owners including warrant holders of the acquired business and the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any amount of the purchase price which effectively comprises a settlement of a pre-existing relationship is not part of the exchange for the acquiree and is therefore not included in the consideration for the purpose of applying the acquisition method. Settlements of pre-existing relationships are accounted for as separate transactions in accordance with the relevant IFRS standards.\n\nIdentifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition by applying relevant valuation methods. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is recognised at the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n## Key accounting estimate in determining the fair value of intangible assets and judgement of whether a transaction is an asset acquisition or a business combination\n\nManagement makes judgements related to intangible assets when assessing whether a transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition. The assessment of whether a transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition involves the optional concentration test, which is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If met the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not met, an assessment is made if the acquired company comprise of a business, and should be accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method involves the use of significant estimates as the identifiable net assets of the acquiree are recognised at their fair value for which observable market prices are typically not available. This is particularly relevant for intangible assets which require use of valuation techniques typically based on estimates of present value of future uncertain cash flows.\n\nFor the 2022 acquisition of Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. valuations of intellectual property rights were based on estimated and risk adjusted net present value of future cash flows. For the 2021 acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. valuation of intellectual property rights is mainly based on Relief From Royalty models, where Management has estimated the net present value of royalties and milestone payments, if the existing research collaboration and license agreement had been extended in time and scope to cover all of the proprietary RNAi technology. Further, pipeline assets and research collaboration and license agreements with other parties than Novo Nordisk are valued based on estimated and risk adjusted net present value of future cash flows.\n\n## 5.4 Related party transactions\n\n## Material transactions with related parties\n\n| DKK million                             | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Novo Holdings A/S                       |        |        |        |\n| Purchase of Novo Nordisk B shares       | 6,984  | 6,695  | 5,963  |\n| Dividend payment to   Novo Holdings A/S | 7,207  | 6,144  | 5,767  |\n| NNIT Group                              |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by NNIT               | 660    | 593    | 775    |\n| Dividend payment from NNIT              | -      | (4)    | (18)   |\n| Novozymes Group                         |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by Novo Nordisk       | (78)   | (116)  | (113)  |\n| Services provided by Novozymes          | 92     | 78     | 72     |\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S is controlled by Novo Holdings A/S (incorporated in Denmark), which owns 28.1% of the share capital in Novo Nordisk A/S, representing 76.9% of the total number of votes.

These non-IFRS financial measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner, and may therefore not be comparable.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented in the Annual Report are:\n\n- - sales and operating profit in constant exchange rates (CER)\n- - return on invested capital (ROIC)\n- - free cash flow\n- - cash to earnings\n\nIFRS refers to an IFRS financial measure.\n\n## Sales and operating profit growth in constant exchange rates\n\n'Growth in constant exchange rates' means that the effect of changes in exchange rates is excluded. It is defined as sales/operating profit for the period measured at the average exchange rates for the same period of the prior year, compared with net sales/operating profit for the same period of the prior year. Price adjustments within hyperinflation countries as defined in IAS 29 'Financial reporting in hyperinflation economies' are excluded from the calculation to avoid growth in constant exchange rates being artificially inflated. Growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information for investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales and operating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.\n\n## Sales in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                       | 2022     | 2021    | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Net sales  IFRS                                   | 176,954  | 140,800 | 126,946 |\n| Effect of exchange rate                           | (13,024) | 3,643   | 3,254   |\n| Sales in constant exchange rates                  | 163,930  | 144,443 | 130,200 |\n| Net sales previous year                           | 140,800  | 126,946 | 122,021 |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported  currencies     | 25.7%    | 10.9%   | 4.0%    |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant  exchange rates | 16.4%    | 13.8%   | 6.7%    |\n\n## Operating profit in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                       | 2022    | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS                            | 74,809  | 58,644 | 54,126 |\n| Effect of exchange rate                           | (7,578) | 2,332  | 1,930  |\n| Operating profit in constant  exchange rates      | 67,231  | 60,976 | 56,056 |\n| Operating profit previous year                    | 58,644  | 54,126 | 52,483 |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported  currencies     | 27.6%   | 8.3%   | 3.1%   |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant  exchange rates | 14.6%   | 12.7%  | 6.8%   |\n\n## Return on invested capital (ROIC)\n\n'ROIC' is defined as 'operating profit after tax' (using the effective tax rate) as a percentage of average inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax assets, less non-interestbearing liabilities including provisions and deferred tax liabilities (where the average is the sum of the above assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year and at year-end divided by two).\n\nManagement believes ROIC is a useful measure in providing investors and Management with information regarding the Group's performance. The calculation of this financial target is a widely accepted measure of earnings efficiency in relation to total capital employed.\n\nThe following tables show the reconciliation of ROIC with operating profit/ equity in %, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure:\n\n## Operating profit/equity in %\n\n| DKK million                  | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS       | 74,809 | 58,644 | 54,126 |\n| / Equity  IFRS               | 83,486 | 70,746 | 63,325 |\n| Operating profit/equity in % | 89.6%  | 82.9%  | 85.5%  |\n\n## ROIC\n\n| DKK million                    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating profit after tax     | 60,146 | 47,384 | 42,922 |\n| / Average net operating assets | 81,744 | 68,634 | 51,824 |\n| ROIC in %                      | 73.6%  | 69.0%  | 82.8%  |\n\n## ROIC numerator\n\nReconciliation of operating profit to operating profit after tax:\n\n| DKK million                                         | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS                              | 74,809   | 58,644   | 54,126   |\n| Tax on operating profit (using  effective tax rate) | (14,663) | (11,260) | (11,204) |\n| Operating profit after tax                          | 60,146   | 47,384   | 42,922   |",

In 2020, the ceiling price was lowered from USD 4 to USD 3, which affects the comparability of 2021 and prior years.\n- 3. In 2021, the engagement survey was entirely redesigned to support Novo Nordisk's strategic goals. As a result, a comparison to previous surveys is not appropriate.\n- 4. In 2021, Company reputation replaced Company trust in order to capture more dimensions of how Novo Nordisk is perceived by external stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated ESG statement\n\n## Section 6 Basis of preparation\n\n## General reporting standards and principles\n\nNovo Nordisk's annual reporting complies with the Danish Financial Statements Act. Sections 99a, 99b, 99d and 107d specify the requirements to report on the management of risks related to the environment, climate, human rights, labour and social conditions, anti-corruption, gender distribution and data ethics. These requirements are addressed in the Management review.\n\nAs recommended by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Novo Nordisk is working to integrate two climate change scenarios into the risk management process to identify short-, medium- and long-term risks within the production and supply chain:\n\n- - Limiting temperature increase to well below 2\u00baC scenario, preferably 1.5\u00baC,\n- compared to pre-industrial times in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n- - 4\u00baC scenario as an alternative high-emission scenario.\n\nNovo Nordisk discloses in accordance with the recommendations put forward by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). For a full breakdown of climate and water impacts, please refer to the publicly available report on Novo Nordisk's CDP disclosures at cdp.net.\n\n## Inclusivity\n\nAs a pharmaceutical business with global reach, Novo Nordisk is committed to being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the organisation. From the perspective of social responsibility, the key stakeholder groups are patients who rely on Novo Nordisk's products, employees at Novo Nordisk and throughout the Group's value chain, business partners and local communities. Novo Nordisk maps its stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion of stakeholder concerns and expectations.\n\n## Materiality\n\nWhen assessing whether a disclosure is material to include in the consolidated ESG statement, Management considers whether the matter is of such\n\nrelevance and importance that it could substantively influence the assessment by providers of financial capital of Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short-, medium- and long-term. This assessment builds on ongoing stakeholder engagement and trend-spotting supplemented by data-driven analysis. The identified key issues are addressed by programmes or action plans with clear and measurable targets. The issues presented in the Annual Report are thus deemed to have a significant impact on the Group's Environmental, Social and Governance performance and thereby the future business performance and may support stakeholders in their decision-making.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe Annual Report reflects how the company is managing operations in ways that consider and respond to stakeholder concerns and interests. The report reaches out to a wide range of stakeholders but is primarily prepared with investors in mind. To all Novo Nordisk stakeholders, the Annual Report is just one element of interaction and communication with the company.\n\n## Impact\n\nUnderstanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative impacts on society and the planet of Novo Nordisk's activities is important and remains a priority for Novo Nordisk.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe disclosures of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions cover production sites, laboratories and offices. The disclosures of water consumption, environmental breaches and waste cover production sites.\n\nThe social and governance-related disclosures cover the Novo Nordisk Group, comprising Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S. Novo Nordisk Engineering A/S is not in the scope of reporting for Sustainable Employer Score, failed inspections, facilitations of Novo Nordisk Way, employees trained in business ethics and gender in management and senior management. Novo Nordisk Pharmatech A/S is not in scope for facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way and employees trained in business ethics.\n\n## Accounting policies and changes hereto\n\nThe accounting policies set out in the notes have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated ESG statement for all the years presented unless stated otherwise below.\n\nDisclosure on emissions has been expanded to include the full range of Scope 3 emissions. Nine categories of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol\n\nhave been found relevant to Novo Nordisk: primarily Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 and 2, waste from operations, business travel, employee commuting, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution and end-of-life treatment of sold products.\n\nAdditionally, while they were disclosed in the Management review in the Annual Report 2021, the percentage changes in average list price and net price across the US product portfolio and insulin portfolio have now been included in the ESG statement with new accounting policies. Novo Nordisk's US product portfolio is inclusive of Diabetes, Obesity and Rare Disease products. Percentage change represents a sales weighted average list and net price for the respective calendar year compared to the sales weighted average list and net price for the prior year and is not reflective of the magnitude of individual list price actions.\n\n## Section 7 Environmental performance\n\n## 7.1 Energy consumption for operations and share of renewable power\n\n## Energy consumption for operations\n\n| 1,000 GJ                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production                        | 3,091  | 2,859  | 2,718  |\n| Office buildings and laboratories | 586    | 528    | 473    |\n| Total energy consumption          | 3,677  | 3,387  | 3,191  |\n\nEnergy consumption for production increased by 8% primarily due to increased production volumes and ramp-up activities within production sites.

        "page_content": "in annual savings of 63 thousand GJ. Energy consumption in office buildings and laboratories increased by 11%, as facilities were utilised more through the year compared to 2021.\n\nIn 2022, 100% of power sourced for production sites was from renewable sources. Since 2020, we have transitioned to sourcing 100% renewable power through a mix of solutions, primarily Renewable Electricity Certificates (REC), Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) as well as on-site renewable solutions.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEnergy consumption for operations is measured as consumption of power, steam, heat and fuel. The fuel is mainly from natural gas, wood, diesel oil, gas oil and light fuel oil. Energy consumption is based on meter readings and invoices. Energy consumption in office buildings outside of Denmark is limited to the consumption of power.\n\nThe share of renewable power used at production sites is reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Scope 2 Guideline. It is calculated as the sum of power in each country that comes from 100% renewable sources, either sourced or self-produced. Renewable solutions include both bundled (PPA) and unbundled solutions (REC) from sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and biomass.\n\n## 7.2 Water consumption for production sites\n\nIn 2022, production sites consumed 3,918 thousand cubic metres of water, an increase of 12% compared to 2021 due to higher production volumes and ramp-up activities within production sites.\n\nProduction sites in France, Brazil, China, Iran and Algeria are located in areas subject to water stress or high seasonal variations (please refer to the CDP Water Security 2022 Reporting Guidance). They consume 13% of the total water for global production. Overall, water consumption at these facilities increased by 7% compared to 2021 due to an increase in production volumes. Implementation of water conservation projects in water-stressed areas led to savings of 6 thousand cubic meters of water.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWater consumption is measured based on meter readings and invoices. It includes drinking water, industrial water and steam water used at production sites.\n\n## 7.3 Breaches of environmental regulatory limit values\n\nIn 2022, there were 75 breaches, an increase from 12 breaches in 2021. The increase is mainly related to wastewater and approximately 90% of the breaches were related to a single site. For all breaches, mitigation mechanisms are now in place and they were reported to the authorities.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBreaches of regulatory limit values cover all breaches reported to the environmental authorities.\n\n## 7.4 Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\nIn 2022, Scope 1 emissions decreased by 1% compared to 2021 due to an increase in usage of renewable energy sources as a result of two production facilities, in the US and France, having converted to using biogas. Scope 2 emissions were in line with 2021. In 2022, we have expanded our Scope 3 reporting to include all categories of emissions from the GHG protocol relevant to Novo Nordisk. The highest portion of Scope 3 emissions was in purchased goods and services and capital goods. These two categories together make up to 85% of the overall Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## CO 2 emissions by Scope 1, 2 and 3\n\n| 1,000 tonnes                                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1                                        | 76     | 77     | 75     |\n| - Production                                   | 25     | 29     | 28     |\n| - Office buildings and laboratories            | 3      | 2      | 2      |\n| - Company cars                                 | 48     | 46     | 45     |\n| Scope 2                                        | 16     | 16     | 15     |\n| - Production                                   | 11     | 10     | 9      |\n| - Office buildings and laboratories            | 5      | 6      | 6      |\n| Scope 3 1                                      | 2,041  | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Purchased goods and services 2               | 1,251  | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Capital goods 2                              | 477    | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Fuel and energy related activities 2         | 55     | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Upstream transportation and distribution 2   | 123    | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Waste generated in operations 2              | 5      | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Business travel                              | 55     | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Employee commuting 2                         | 35     | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - Downstream transportation and distribution 2 | 37     | N/A    | N/A    |\n| - End-of-life treatment of sold  products 2    | 3      | N/A    | N/A    |\n| Total CO 2  emissions                          | 2,133  | N/A    | N/A    |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## CO 2 emissions from company cars\n\nCO 2 emissions from company cars cover cars leased or owned by Novo Nordisk. Emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factors by the volumes of diesel and petrol used.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions comprise direct CO 2 emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nScope 2 emissions comprise CO 2 emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, heat and steam.\n\nFor a full overview of location-based emissions, please visit cdp.net.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nNovo Nordisk has identified nine relevant categories, out of the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions as defined by the GHG protocol.\n\n## Purchased goods and services\n\nPurchased goods and services includes emissions related to all spend from external suppliers except for investment spend and travel categories. Purchased goods and services contribute to the greatest share of Scope 3 emissions and mainly comprise of raw materials for products, marketing, packaging materials as well as consumables for laboratory and IT office equipment.\n\nDirect spend is converted using the average data method into CO 2 e emissions. Material weights are matched with CO 2 e factors depending on data availability. A spend-based factor is applied for direct spend data where no weight can be obtained. Indirect spend is converted into CO 2 e using a spend-based method.\n\n## Capital goods\n\nCapital goods includes emissions related to all indirect investment spend from external suppliers, specifically production utilities and equipment. Indirect spend is converted via the average spend-based method into CO 2 e emissions using emission factors.\n\n## Fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 and 2\n\nFuel and energy related activities includes all upstream CO 2 e emissions of purchased fuels and energy (beyond Scope 1 and 2 emissions). Energy consumption is converted from GJ to kWh and multiplied by DEFRA's countryspecific emissions' factors to assess CO 2 e tonnes. The category comprises upstream emissions from electricity, steam and heat, upstream emissions from transportation and distribution of electricity, steam and heat and emissions from upstream fuel.\n\n## Upstream transportation and distribution\n\nUpstream transportation and distribution includes CO 2 e emissions from product distribution and transportation from tier 1 suppliers to Novo Nordisk facilities.\n\nCO 2 e emissions from product distribution are calculated by an external supplier managing the transportation and distribution processes on behalf of Novo Nordisk and using the industry standard EcoTransit solution. CO 2 e emissions are calculated based on the worldwide distribution of semifinished and finished products, raw materials and components by air, sea and road between production sites and from production sites to subsidiaries, direct customers and importing distributors. CO 2 e emissions from product distribution from subsidiaries to pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers are not included. Due to the lack of reliable emissions data from specific freight forwarders, an estimated 3% of trucking emissions are not included in the Scope.\n\nCO 2 e emissions from tier 1 suppliers to Novo Nordisk facilities are calculated based on the assumption that all purchased direct materials are transported 1,000 km by a diesel truck.\n\n## Waste generated in operations\n\nWaste generated in own operations includes CO 2 e emissions associated with third-party disposal and treatment of waste generated from production sites, offices and labs. Currently, waste data is available for production sites and offices as well as labs within Denmark. Waste data is not available for offices and labs outside of Denmark, for which CO 2 e emissions are therefore extrapolated using waste-type-specific method.\n\n## Business travel\n\nBusiness travel includes CO 2 emissions from business flights and other travel, such as hotel stays and taxis.\n\nCO 2 emissions from business flights are estimated based on mileage and passenger class details obtained from travel agencies. These are multiplied by emission factors for short-, medium- and long-haul flights. EPA emission factors are used to perform the calculations. Currently, 90% of emissions from flights are calculated based on data provided by travel agencies and the remaining 10% are extrapolated based on the average CO 2 emissions per employee. CO 2 emissions from other travel-related activities are calculated using a spend-based approach.\n\n## Employee commuting\n\nEmployee commuting includes CO 2 e emissions associated with commuting by all employees except those with company cars, since these emissions\n\nare reported as Scope 1 emissions. CO 2 e emissions are estimated using the average data method and based on assumptions for the top six countries (Denmark, USA, India, China, France and Brazil) in terms of number of employees, which account for 85% of the employee base. Average distance and mode of transportation are used to calculate the CO 2 e emissions for the remaining 15% of employees.\n\n## Downstream transportation and distribution\n\nDownstream transportation and distribution includes CO 2 e emissions that occur from transportation and distribution of sold products in vehicles and facilities not owned or controlled by Novo Nordisk. Only transportation emissions are included in the calculations, specifically from the first receiving warehouse to pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers. A simulation-based approach is applied to calculate downstream emissions, using a distancebased method by simulating route networks for four countries (Denmark, UK, Switzerland and Brazil). Transportation work (tonne-km) and CO 2 e emissions are estimated by calculating the distance travelled for the weight of distributed products and cool boxes. Moreover, the modelled route networks provide the basis for simulating US and China transportation and distribution. Transportation work per net kg product from the six reference countries (Denmark, UK, Switzerland, Brazil, China and US) is extrapolated to the remaining countries. Emissions per country are calculated based on i) the weight of sold products, ii) reference country transportation work and iii) the emission factor for the region and mode of transportation.\n\n## End-of-life treatment of sold products\n\nEnd-of-life treatment of sold products includes CO 2 e from end-of-life treatment of all products sold to the market, including packaging. The amount of sold products is calculated from the realised sales data for specific devices and markets. It is assumed that devices are discarded in the markets where they are sold and that the end-of-life treatment follows the general treatment of the household waste for each market. Scenarios have been developed for end-of-life treatment for various Novo Nordisk products (FlexPen \u00ae , FlexTouch \u00ae , NovoFine \u00ae needle etc.). The scenarios cover the US, EU and Japan. The remaining CO 2 e emissions from other products are extrapolated by unit sales based on average end-of-life emissions from the products.",

Less than 1% of total waste was sent to landfill. In 2022, 16% of the waste was categorised as hazardous waste.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWaste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed of at production sites based on weight receipts. Organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, where the energy is\n\nrecovered in biogas plants and the digested slurry is used on local farmland as fertiliser. Ethanol is recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used. Energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant. Waste with no energy recovery covers water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as hazardous waste for incineration and various other types of waste.\n\n## Section 8 Social performance\n\n## 8.1 Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products\n\nThe estimated number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products increased from 34.6 million in 2021 to 36.3 million in 2022. The 5% increase was primarily driven by growth in the GLP-1 franchise, which increased by 2.4 million patients, followed by the new-generation insulin franchise, which grew by 0.8 million patients.\n\nIn 2022, the estimated number of patients with diabetes reached with Novo Nordisk's human insulin vials through the Access to Insulin Commitment was 1.8 million, compared to 1.7 million in 2021. Novo Nordisk also sold human insulin vials below the ceiling price of USD 3 in countries outside the commitment, reaching an estimated additional 2.5 million patients in 2022. This represents a total of 4.3 million patients with diabetes reached with human insulin in vials below USD 3 per vial globally. In addition to offering insulin at a low price, supply chain improvements and capacity building are also important levers in ensuring access to affordable care for vulnerable patients.\n\nThrough the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme, 41,033 vulnerable children were reached by the end of 2022, compared to 31,846 in 2021. More than half of the 9,187 newly enrolled children were reached through expansion of the programme in Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products, excluding devices, is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient for each product class as defined by the WHO.\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products (human insulin in vials) via the Access to Insulin Commitment is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient reached via the Access to Insulin Commitment as defined by the WHO.\n\nThe WHO-defined daily dosage for these products may not accurately reflect the recommended or prescribed daily dose. Actual doses are based on individual characteristics (e.g., age and weight) and pharmacokinetic considerations. Despite this uncertainty, Novo Nordisk assesses this to be the most consistent way of reporting.\n\nThe number of children reached with diabetes care treatment through the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme is measured as the total accumulated number of children enrolled since the initiation of the partnership in 2009.\n\n## 8.2 Employees\n\n## Employees\n\n| Year-end number                             | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| North America Operations                    | 7,250  | 6,106  | 6,213  |\n| International Operations                    | 47,935 | 42,372 | 39,110 |\n| - EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) | 30,870 | 26,680 | 24,600 |\n| - of which in Denmark                       | 22,916 | 19,150 | 17,538 |\n| - China (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan) | 6,148  | 5,833  | 5,548  |\n| - Rest of World (all other countries)       | 10,917 | 9,859  | 8,962  |\n| Total employees                             | 55,185 | 48,478 | 45,323 |\n| Full-time employees                         | 54,393 | 47,792 | 44,723 |\n\nThe number of employees increased in most areas with the highest growth in EMEA, notably in Product Supply, Quality & IT, and North America Operations. The employee turnover rate decreased from 11.0% in 2021 to 8.2% in 2022. The highest decline in turnover incurred in China and the US.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of employees is recorded as all employees except externals, employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees and substitutes at year-end.",

Employees in corporate functions are included in EMEA and employees in Global Business Services in Bangalore, India, are included in Rest of World.\n\nThe rate of turnover is measured as the number of employees, excluding temporary employees, who left the Group during the financial year divided by the average number of employees, excluding temporary employees. Employees working for Group companies that have been disposed off are not counted as having left the Group.\n\n## 8.3 Sustainable employer score\n\nA global employee survey called \"Evolve\" supports Novo Nordisk's ambition to be a sustainable employer, underpinning the broader sustainable business agenda. The Evolve survey was repeated in 2022 with an additional question, meant to measure follow-throughs of the previous year's survey results and an open text question on how to improve the equality of opportunity for a successful career at Novo Nordisk.\n\nThis year's Evolve revealed an increase in the already high overall engagement, bringing it to 85% favourable compared to 84% favourable in 2021. Novo Nordisk continues to score in the top decile against external organisations when it comes to providing a purpose-driven workplace. Improvements were seen on most questions, with a large improvement of 9 percentage points favourable on 'Equal opportunities for a successful career'. Nevertheless, opportunities for improvement remain on equality of career opportunities, clearer performance evaluations and, in particular, improving follow-throughs of survey results.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Sustainable employer score measures the average percentage of favourable answers to the 18 engagement items in the survey. Favourable answers are defined as \"Agree\" and \"Strongly agree\" to positively framed questions. The survey is administered by an external vendor.\n\n## 8.4 Frequency of occupational accidents\n\nIn 2022, Novo Nordisk had 128 accidents with absence (99 in 2021). This increase was partly due to an increase in the number of employees. The average lost time injury frequency rate was 1.5 in 2022 (1.3 in 2021).\n\nSadly, Novo Nordisk had two work-related fatalities compared to zero in 2021. Two employees of Novo Nordisk on a business trip, travelling with a driver, had a car accident resulting in all three passengers being killed immediately. Novo Nordisk will continue to train and motivate employees and contractors on good road safety behaviour to reduce the risk of recurrences.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently implementing a new global incident reporting system to ensure standardised reporting, and will continue ongoing preventive health and safety activities, such as focusing on high-risk incidents and ergonomic programmes.\n\nFor a full overview of Novo Nordisk's Health and Safety framework, please refer to Novo Nordisk's ESG Portal at novonordisk.com.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe frequency of occupational accidents is measured as the internally reported number of accidents with absence per million nominal working hours, or Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF). Contractors, visitors, employees on unpaid leave, interns, and bachelor and master thesis students are not included. An occupational accident with absence is any work-related accident causing at least one day of absence in addition to the day of the accident.\n\n## 8.5 Gender diversity\n\n## Gender in leadership positions\n\n| Ratio men:women                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CEO, EVP, SVP                            | 71:29  | 72:28  | 76:24  |\n| CVP, VP                                  | 60:40  | 63:37  | 64:36  |\n| Director, Manager, Team Leader           | 55:45  | 57:43  | 58:42  |\n| Gender in leadership positions (overall) | 56:44  | 57:43  | 59:41  |\n| Gender in senior leadership positions    | 61:39  | 64:36  | 65:35  |\n| Gender in the Board of Directors         | 54:46  | 67:33  | 62:38  |\n\nThe gender diversity in leadership positions overall at Novo Nordisk meets the Danish gender diversity requirements. Gender diversity in leadership positions increased from 43% in 2021 to 44% in 2022. Within senior leadership positions, there was an increase from 36% in 2021 to 39% in 2022. Among employees as a whole, the gender split was 49% women and 51% men in 2022.\n\nAll management teams, from entry level upwards, are encouraged to focus on enhanced diversity, with the aim of ensuring a robust pipeline of talent for leadership positions. In 2021, Novo Nordisk introduced a global aspirational target of achieving a balanced gender representation across all managerial levels with a minimum of 45% for both women and men in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, three shareholder-elected Board members were women and six were men. The 2024 target of having at least three shareholder-elected Board members of each gender was thus met; however, the Board considers that diversity in the broadest sense of the word remains a focus area, including in Board member searches. Further information about the Board members is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDiversity at Novo Nordisk is reported as the percentage split by gender in leadership positions. Senior leadership positions are defined as employees in the global job levels Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Executive Vice President (EVP), Senior Vice President (SVP), Corporate Vice President (CVP) and Vice President (VP). Overall leadership positions are defined as Directors, Managers, Team Leaders and senior leadership positions.\n\nDiversity on the Board of Directors is reported as the percentage split by gender among all members, including employee-elected members.",

In 2022, the average net price of both the US product portfolio and the US insulin portfolio decreased by 10.5% and 19.5%, respectively, compared to 12.3% and 10.9% in 2021, as a result of enhancements to secure formulary access for insured patients as well as the evolution of channel and payer mix. Novo Nordisk has provided sales discounts and rebates amounting to 75% of US gross sales in 2022, which is in line with 2021. This resulted in the average annual list price across the US product portfolio increasing by 2.4% compared to 1.6% in 2021. The average list price across the US insulin portfolio remained consistent with 2021.\n\n|                                                     | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| US product portfolio % change   vs prior year       |         |         |         |\n| List price change - Avg.                            | 2.4%    | 1.6%    | 2.3%    |\n| Net price change - Avg.                             | (10.5%) | (12.3%) | (16.9%) |\n| Total US insulin portfolio % change   vs prior year |         |         |         |\n| List price change - Avg.                            | 0%      | 0%      | 0.5%    |\n| Net price change - Avg.                             | (19.5%) | (10.9%) | (26.9%) |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe US product portfolio is inclusive of Diabetes, Obesity and Rare Disease products. Percentage change represents a sales weighted average list and net price for the respective calendar year compared to the sales weighted average list and net price for the prior year and is not reflective of the magnitude of individual list price actions. The net price represents the average list price minus rebates, discounts and returns for the specific product for the year in which it is being calculated.\n\n## 8.7 Total tax contribution\n\n## Total tax contribution\n\n| DKK million                  | Taxes  borne   | Taxes  collected   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate income  taxes paid | 14,515         | 4,582              | 19,097 | 18,390 | 13,577 |\n| Employment taxes             | 2,279          | 10,727             | 13,006 | 10,840 | 9,588  |\n| Indirect taxes               | 2,273          | 754                | 3,027  | 2,612  | 2,497  |\n| Other taxes                  | 873            | -                  | 873    | 751    | 714    |\n| Total                        | 19,940         | 16,063             | 36,003 | 32,593 | 26,376 |\n\nThe total tax contribution in 2022 amounted to DKK 36,003 million split across 55% of taxes borne and 45% of taxes collected. In 2021, the split was 57% of taxes borne and 43% of taxes collected.\n\nIn 2021, corporate income tax was unusually high as additional corporate income tax had been paid in Denmark relating to both the prior year and the prepayment for 2021. The prepayment exceeded the actual payable tax and was partially refunded in 2022. Furthermore, profit before tax has increased for 2022, resulting in an overall increase in corporate income taxes paid.\n\nThe overall increase in total tax contribution from 2021 to 2022 is primarily related to an increase in employment taxes primarily due to the hiring of new employees globally, as production and sales have been increasing.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk's total tax contribution is measured as the taxes borne or collected by Novo Nordisk, which have been paid in the respective year. Taxes borne are defined as taxes where Novo Nordisk carries the cost. Taxes collected are defined as taxes collected by Novo Nordisk on behalf of others, e.g., employee income taxes deducted from employee salaries and paid to the government.\n\n## Corporate income taxes paid\n\nCorporate income taxes paid primarily consist of corporate income taxes and withholding taxes on company dividends paid during the year.\n\n## Employment taxes\n\nEmployment taxes primarily consist of taxes collected from employees on behalf of the government and social security costs (part of payroll taxes in some countries).\n\n## Indirect taxes\n\nIndirect taxes consist of non-refundable VAT, net VAT collections, customs duties, environmental taxes and property taxes.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nOther taxes consist of country-specific taxes not linked to one of the categories above, e.g., the US branded prescription drug fee.\n\n## 8.8 Donations and other contributions\n\n## Donations and other contributions\n\n| DKK million                              | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| World Diabetes Foundation (WDF)          | 93     | 92     | 138    |\n| Novo Nordisk Haemophilia                 |        |        |        |\n| Foundation (NNHF)                        | 33     | -      | 20     |\n| Total donations and other  contributions | 126    | 92     | 158    |\n\nThe WDF, an independent trust, supports sustainable partnerships and acts as a catalyst to help others do more.

In 2022, 99% of employees completed and documented their training compared to 98% in 2021. The increase represents the emphasis of Novo Nordisk in diligently following up on employees to ensure completion of the annual training. The remaining 1% missing is mainly due to employees being on leave.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of business ethics reviews is recorded as the number of business ethics reviews performed by Group Internal Audit in subsidiaries, production sites, vendors and headquarter areas.\n\nThe mandatory business ethics training is based on the Business Ethics Code of Conduct in the form of globally applicable e-learning and related tests. The percentage of employees completing the training is calculated as the percentage of completion of the Code of Conduct test.\n\n## 9.2 Supplier audits\n\n## Supplier audits\n\n| Number                      |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Responsible sourcing audits |     14 |     16 |      7 |\n| Quality audits              |    280 |    237 |    170 |\n| Total supplier audits       |    294 |    253 |    177 |\n\nThe number of audits concluded in 2022 increased by 16% compared to 2021. The increase in the number of supplier audits represents the general activity level at Novo Nordisk. The travel restrictions related to COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on the ability to conduct audits during 2022, though local restrictions were in effect during the year. In 2022, two critical findings were issued. The first critical finding regarding control of labels was issued during a routine audit. For this, a follow-up audit was conducted, which found that the issue had been closed satisfactorily. The second critical finding regarding environmental monitoring was issued during a qualification audit. The work related to the remediation of this finding is still ongoing.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of supplier audits concluded by Novo Nordisk's Corporate Quality function consists of the number of responsible sourcing audits and quality audits conducted at suppliers. We conduct our audits internally and do not participate in third party audit programs.\n\n## 9.3 Product recalls\n\nIn 2022, Novo Nordisk had 3 product recalls. In Belgium, the recall was due to distribution without approved commercialisation. In Finland and Sweden, the recall was due to temporary communication timeouts during dose log transfers. In Algeria, the recall was due to a mix-up of information on the vignette for one of Novo Nordisk's products. None of the recalls were Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) class I.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of product recalls is recorded as the number of times Novo Nordisk has instituted a recall and includes recalls in connection with clinical trials. A recall can affect various countries.\n\n## 9.4 Failed inspections\n\nIn 2022, Novo Nordisk had not failed any inspections among those that were resolved at year-end. During 2022, 150 inspections of Novo Nordisk were conducted. The number of inspections is close to the level it was at before COVID-19. At year-end, 113 inspections were passed and 37 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received or the final authority's acceptance was pending, which is normal. Follow-up on unresolved inspections will continue in 2023.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn 2022, we expanded the scope of reporting on failed inspections to include all inspections, as opposed to 2021, when only inspections from specific health authorities were reported. The change of methodology did not result in a restatement of the comparative periods.\n\nFailed inspections are defined as inspections where Warning Letters or EMA non-compliance letters related to GMP inspections are received, GMP/ISO certificates for strategic sites are lost, pre-approval inspections result in a Complete Response Letter, study conclusions are changed due to GCP/GLP inspection issues, or marketing or import authorisations are withdrawn due to inspection issues. Strategic sites are defined as the manufacturing sites in Brazil, China, Denmark, France and the US.\n\n## 9.5 Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way\n\nIn 2022, a total of 36 units were facilitated and more than 1,700 employees were individually interviewed. In addition, feedback on those units was collected from approximately 400 stakeholders. Overall, the 2022 process continues to show a good level of adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way. Five units were found to be in breach of one or more of the Novo Nordisk Essentials.\n\nMany positive observations were made in facilitations regarding elements of the Novo Nordisk Way. Facilitations found that patient-centricity (Essential 1We create value by having a patient-centred business approach) was both a strong motivator for staff engagement and a critical contributor to business success, especially in managing periodic supply constraints across the globe. A high standard of Business Ethics (Essential 10 - We never compromise on quality and business ethics) was reported in most units. Leaders and staff remained committed to the company's sustainability focus and looked",

It is an internal process for assessing adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way. The assessments are based on a review of documentation and feedback from stakeholders followed by an on-site visit during which randomly selected employees and management are interviewed. Identified gaps and improvement opportunities related to the Novo Nordisk Way are presented to and discussed with Management. The facilitators and Management agree on an action plan to address those gaps and improvement opportunities.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and the parent financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2022, and of the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January 2022 - 31 December 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements under the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nFurther, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the Parent's financial position at 31 December 2022, and of the results of its operations for the financial year 1 January 2022 - 31 December 2022 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our Long-form Auditor's report issued to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements section of this auditor's report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\nWe were appointed auditors of Novo Nordisk A/S for the first time on 25 March 2021, for the financial year 2021.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements for the financial year 1 January 2022 - 31 December 2022.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nUS sales rebates\n\nRefer to notes 2.1 and 3.5 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the United States (US), sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, namely Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and managed healthcare plans. In January 2021, the Group changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk has only recognised revenue related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program to the extent that it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records provisions for the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration) at the time the related sales are recorded.\n\nThe provision for sales rebates and discounts amounted to DKK 69,499 million as of 31 December 2022, a significant portion of which related to the US business.\n\nThe US sales rebates, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, involved significant measurement uncertainty as the provisions are based on legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical claims experience, payer channel mix, current contract prices, unbilled claims, claims submission time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Consequently, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used to develop sales rebates provisions, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, by involving audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience to assist us in performing our auditing procedures.\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to sales rebates, including controls over the assumptions and data used to estimate these rebates.\n\nWe tested rebate claims processed, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the conditions and terms of rebate arrangements.\n\nWe tested the overall reasonableness of the accruals recorded at period end by developing an expectation for comparison to actual recorded balances.\n\nWe evaluated Management's ability to estimate sales rebates accurately by considering the historical accuracy of the estimates in prior year.",

We did not identify any material misstatement of the management review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and these parent financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent's internal control.\n- -   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- -   Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- -   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and, where applicable, safeguards put in place and measures taken to eliminate threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements of Novo Nordisk A/S, we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 with the file name NOVO-2022-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation), which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements including notes.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- -   The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- -   The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- -   Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human readable format; and\n- -   For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- -   Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- -   Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- -   Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements including notes;\n- -   Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- -   Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- -   Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 with the file name NOVO-2022-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nCopenhagen, 1 February 2023\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State-Authorised Public Accountant Mne25299",

Furthermore, Management is responsible for establishing objective accounting policies for the preparation of ESG data, for the overall content of the ESG statement, and for measuring and reporting ESG data in accordance with the Basis of preparation and the ESG accounting policies.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our engagement with Management and in accordance with the agreed scope of work. We have conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation, to obtain limited assurance about our conclusion. Greenhouse Gas emissions quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emission factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\n## We are responsible for:\n\n- -  planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the ESG statement is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies;\n- -  forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained; and\n- -  reporting our conclusion to the Management and broader stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nDeloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 (ISQM 1), which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the requirements for independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement in the ESG statement. To do so, we have:\n\n- -  conducted interviews with data owners and internal stakeholders to understand the key processes and control activities for measuring, recording and reporting the ESG data;\n- -  performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis to check that data has been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;\n- -  performed analysis of data, selected based on risk and materiality;\n- -  made inquiries regarding significant developments in the reported data;\n- -  considered the presentation and disclosure of the ESG statement;\n- -  assessed that the process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions data follows the principles of relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy outlined in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard Revised edition (2015) and The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011); and\n- -  evaluated the evidence obtained.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the ESG data on pages 89 to 97 in the statement of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance for the period 1 January - 31 December 2022, have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Basis of preparation and the ESG accounting policies.\n\nCopenhagen, 1 February 2023\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State-Authorised Public Accountant Mne25299\n\nHelena Barton Lead Reviewer",

Supplementary reports can be downloaded from novonordisk.com/annualreport, while additional information can be found at novonordisk.com\n\n## Materiality\n\nNovo Nordisk relies on the International Integrated Reporting Council's definition of materiality. Information deemed material for providers of financial capital in their decision-making is included in the Annual Report, i.e., it being of such relevance and importance that it could substantively influence their assessments of Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short, medium and long term. See how Novo Nordisk determines materiality and material issues at novonordisk.com\n\n## Annual Report\n\nThis Annual Report is Novo Nordisk's full statutory Annual Report pursuant to Section 149(1) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nThe statutory Annual Report will be presented and adopted at the Annual General Meeting on 23 March 2023 and will subsequently be submitted to and be available at the Danish Business Authority.\n\nThe Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and the Danish Financial Statements Act. Moreover, it meets the requirements of an integrated report, as per the International Integrated Reporting Framework.\n\nNovo Nordisk meets the requirements for Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact, a voluntary reporting on performance towards its ten principles on human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption and additional progress reporting on corporate sustainability leadership and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Novo Nordisk also adheres to the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework on respect of human rights. For our commitment, please refer to the Novo Nordisk Human Rights Report on our ESG Portal at novonordisk.com.\n\n## Form 20 F\n\nThe Form 20-F is filed using a standardised reporting form so that investors can evaluate the company alongside US domestic equities. It is an annual reporting requirement by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for foreign private issuers with equity shares listed on exchanges in the United States.\n\n## Remuneration Report\n\nThe Remuneration Report describes in accordance with section 139b of the Danish Companies Act the remuneration awarded or due during 2022 to members of the Board and Executive Management registered with the Danish Business Authority. The Remuneration Report is submitted to the Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote.\n\n## Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report discloses Novo Nordisk's compliance with corporate governance to meet the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n## References\n\nThroughout the Management review section in this report, links are provided to online sources for additional information.

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## 1 Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (Class D) and other accounting regulations for companies listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen.\n\nThe accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company are unchanged from the previous financial year except for implementation of accounting policy related to goodwill. The accounting policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. For a description of the accounting policies of the Group, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent company; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group.\n\n## Supplementary accounting policies for the parent company\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nGoodwill recognised in subsidiaries is amortised over 10 to 23 years, which reflects the useful life of the underlying assets and activities generating the goodwill.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nIn the financial statements of the parent company, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity method, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries and associated companies. The equity method is used as a measurement basis rather than a consolidation method.\n\nThe net profit of subsidiaries and associated companies less unrealised intra-group profits and amortisation of goodwill is recorded in the income statement of the parent company. To the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such companies, the net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according to the equity method. Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are disclosed as profit after tax.\n\nAmounts owed by affiliates, where settlement is neither planned nor likely within the foreseeable future, are treated as part of net-investments in subsidiaries, with exchange rate adjustments recognised directly in equity through reserve for cash flow hedges and exchange rate adjustments.\n\n## Tax\n\nFor Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a Danish on-account tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax. All current taxes under the scheme are recorded in the individual companies. Novo Nordisk A/S and its jointly taxed subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation of the parent company, Novo Holdings A/S.\n\n## 2 Sales\n\n| DKK million                   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Sales by business segment     |         |         |\n| Diabetes and Obesity care     | 142,413 | 112,347 |\n| Rare disease                  | 243     | 206     |\n| Total sales                   | 142,656 | 112,553 |\n| Sales by geographical segment |         |         |\n| North America Operations      | 79,953  | 57,654  |\n| International Operations:     |         |         |\n| EMEA                          | 32,789  | 27,124  |\n| China                         | 14,412  | 15,608  |\n| Rest of World                 | 15,502  | 12,167  |\n| Total sales                   | 142,656 | 112,553 |\n\nSales are attributed to a geographical segment based on location of the customer.
