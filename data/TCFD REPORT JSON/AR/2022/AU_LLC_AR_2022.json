        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nThis year we moved into the Create phase of the Group's /five-year Reset, Create, Thrive strategic roadmap, and I am pleased to report strong progress in our turnaround, which saw Lendlease continue its transition from a Development-led to an Investmentsled organisation.\n\nHowever, a combination of the di/fficult market environment, provisions relating to activities from prior periods, and the industry-wide retrospective action taken by the UK Government to extend the warranty period for completed residential buildings to 30 years, resulted in a substantial Statutory loss and a modest core operating pro/fit.\n\nA stable full year distribution and dividend payment of 16 cents per security re/flects a payout ratio of 43 per cent on core operating earnings.\n\n## Strategic direction\n\nThe Board is con/fident Lendlease now has the right strategy in place to drive future value for our securityholders, via the delivery of sustainable, recurring earnings. This will be achieved through growth in funds management income, leveraging both our development pipeline and our capital transaction capabilities to grow funds under management.\n\nGrowing the Investments platform; accelerating the realisation of our development pipeline in a pro/fitable, more capital-e/fficient manner; and a continued focus on operational e/fficiency, are key elements of the strategic road map.\n\nThough markets remain challenging given geopolitical events and changed monetary policy settings, much has been achieved, including deployment of funds into new products, continuing to scale our development pipeline with our capital partners through project acquisition, maintaining discipline and execution excellence in our Construction business in the face of in/flationary and global supply chain pressures, and continued progress across important sustainability targets.\n\nUnder Tony's leadership, the senior executive team has been renewed, and the organisation focused on executing our strategy and business simpli/fication. This includes continuing to pursue capital recycling initiatives to support business growth and maintain prudent gearing. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nWhile market conditions continue to provide headwinds, the Board remains focused on positioning the business to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve.\n\nThis includes investing in the right capability to drive outcomes in the Investments business; investigating pathways to accelerate the realisation of value and capital in the Development business; and improving risk reward outcomes in the Construction business.\n\nFollowing material cost reductions delivered in FY22, additional cost initiatives were announced post balance date to further improve e/fficiency and securityholder returns. The full bene/fit of these cost savings is expected to be realised in future years and importantly, these cost savings do not impact our ability to deliver the FY26 roadmap, including execution of the development pipeline and growth in Investments.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of our people, our subcontractors and those who interact with the places we create and manage is our highest priority, with the welfare of our people being one of the founding principles of Lendlease.\n\nAcross all our operations where Lendlease was responsible for the operational control of health and safety outcomes, there were no fatalities recorded in FY23. For projects where work was not under our operational control, there was a fatality of a subcontract worker on the 1 Java Street project in New York. We extend our sincerest condolences to the family and colleagues of the man who lost his life.\n\nIncidents such as this are a sombre reminder of the emphasis we must place on safety, as well as the ongoing support we must o/ffer to our supply chain partners to improve safety performance.\n\nOur overall safety performance demonstrated continued improvement across a number of key safety metrics.\n\nOur health and safety focus has also been expanded to incorporate Physical, Product, and Psychological safety at all stages of the property lifecycle, from investment decisions to operations and maintenance.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nWe continued to renew the Board with the appointment of Margaret Lui as a Non Executive Director in 2022. Margaret is based in Singapore and brings extensive international investment management experience to the Board, which aligns with the Group's Investmentsled strategy.\n\nMargaret will stand for election at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, along with Phil Co/ffey, Elizabeth Proust and Robert Welanetz, who will each be standing for re-election.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>10%\n\nCompound annual FUM growth since FY21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n~$23b\n\nWork in Progress, accelerating delivery",

As we work towards fossil fuel-free construction, we are increasing our use of electric construction equipment and using renewable diesel as a transition fuel where available. Funding support was secured from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for the geothermal heat exchange system at 1 Java Street, an all-electric building and the largest geothermal residential system in New York State.\n\nSince launching our $250m social value target in 2020, we have created more than $180m of social value through the work of our shared value partnerships.

        "page_content": "## Global Chief Executive Officer's Report\n\nWhen I took the role as Lendlease CEO two years ago, I accepted the challenge of transforming our company into one that not only delivered outstanding environmental and social outcomes, but sustainable /financial returns as well.\n\nDespite a cascade of market challenges, including the recent instability from in/flationary and interest rate pressures and the residual impacts of the pandemic on our industry, we have taken steps in the past 12 months to set the company up to deliver more sustainable returns to securityholders.\n\nWe made signi/ficant strides in delivering against our /five-year turnaround plan Reset, Create, Thrive . We continued to grow our funds under management (FUM) to generate more reliable and recurring income. We sharpened our focus on development projects in our pipeline that support our FUM growth. And we rightsized our construction workbook around projects that carry less risk and generate more predictable returns.\n\nIn parallel, we continued to re/fine the way we work in order to be more productive as a business and e/fficient in the way we operate. This 'always on' program is helping us progressively lower our cost base while redirecting our global workforce to those activities that deliver the highest value for securityholders.\n\nHowever, our /financial results for the year were negatively impacted by provisions against prior projects and receivables primarily in our international operations, and this is extremely disappointing. The actions we are taking to transform Lendlease aim to reduce these impacts and instead create earnings certainty for our securityholders.\n\n## Accelerating funds growth\n\nWe successfully grew FUM by nine per cent during the period to $48.3b despite challenging market conditions. Our investment partners remained engaged across our portfolio of opportunities including build-to-rent (BTR) and sustainable o/ffice. In addition, we made good progress in building our Investments platform through new hires.\n\nWe began to acquire new opportunities in the marketplace including 21 Moor/fields in London, and acquired assets for our\n\nrecently created value-add Real Estate Partners 4 fund.\n\nOur global BTR funds under management grew to more than $3b. We also launched our /first BTR projects in Australia. Given our strong international capability in this asset class, which is set to experience sustained growth given housing shortages in many of the cities in which we operate, we're ideally positioned to maximise the value of the $28b of BTR product in our global development pipeline.\n\n## Scaling development\n\nOur development pipeline is $124b. Translating this pipeline into active projects provides earnings visibility into future years. This drives our strategic focus to only commence projects with an appropriate risk pro/file./uni00A0\n\nWe commenced $7.7b of projects alongside our investment partners, including large superannuation funds. These commencements take our work in progress to $22.9b at year end and provide the ideal platform as markets recover.\n\nDuring the year we completed $3.6b of projects, including Salesforce Tower at Circular Quay, and Blue and William at North Sydney, to meet continued demand for well appointed, sustainable o/ffices - a key asset class where customers demand best in class.\n\nSigni/ficant work was done to replenish our development pipeline in Australia where we won the privilege to create the iconic $3.1b Sydney Harbour project, One Circular Quay. We were also announced as preferred developer for the historic and much-loved Queen Victoria Market precinct on behalf of the City of Melbourne.\n\n## Executing with excellence\n\nIn FY22 we simpli/fied our operating model and management structure, removing more than $170m in operating expense in the Reset phase of our turnaround plan. This disciplined cost reduction approach was sustained through FY23. We are undertaking additional operational changes to further focus resources behind activities which generate the highest sustainable returns. We expect our current actions will generate cost savings pre tax of more\n\nthan $150m per annum, with c.$60m expected to be realised in FY24.\n\nA disciplined approach to cost management is especially important in the Construction segment where a recent spate of insolvencies demonstrates the risk inherent in this traditionally low margin segment. To improve pro/fitability and reduce future risk, we've made the decision to no longer undertake certain types of work, for example residential build to sell, and remain selective in our customer portfolio./uni00A0\n\nOur Construction business has a productfocused backlog of c.$8.7b and is well positioned for FY24 with a renewed focus on risk adjusted returns. The business remains a key component and di/fferentiator of our integrated model, contributing to the origination and delivery of our urban projects.\n\n## Investing in our people\n\nWe commenced a reduction of our global workforce to better re/flect the resources required for the work we do. But we haven't reduced our focus on developing our people, signi/ficantly investing in their career development and learning, and backing our leaders to be more impactful and inclusive. Pleasingly, our employee engagement increased versus a declining global average. In more than half of our operating locations, our teams recorded engagement levels above external country benchmarks.\n\nDriving further engagement is a key operating principle across my leadership team. While we still have more to do, I'm con/fident the engagement of our people will continue to build during the Create phase of our turnaround and as we move towards Thrive .\n\n## Progressing our Sustainability targets\n\nOperating sustainably forms a core part of our DNA. It's also fundamental to how we do business - whether investing, developing or building. Further, our global sustainability leadership helps us attract investment partners and tenants, contributes to our investment performance, provides a competitive advantage, and helps us attract and retain talent.",

To that end, we are /firmly on track to achieve our Net Zero carbon by 2025 target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nAnd we have increased our engagement with industry associations and our supply chain, advocating for rapid decarbonisation, as we know industry collaboration will be crucial if we're to achieve our absolute zero carbon by 2040 target for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\n## Financial and operating performance\n\nDisappointingly, Lendlease reported a Statutory Loss after Tax of $232m, driven by non-cash losses in relation to industrywide retrospective UK Government action on UK residential buildings and lower property valuations in the Investments segment.\n\nCore operating pro/fit of $257m was down from $276m in the prior year with improved Development earnings more than o/ffset by lower contributions from Investments and Construction.\n\nConsistent with our ongoing focus to maintain balance sheet /flexibility, we completed several transactions including further monetising our US Military\n\nHousing Asset Management income stream, completing $0.6b in PLLACes transactions on residential towers at Barangaroo, conducting a partial bond buyback and introducing a majority capital partner for the One Circular Quay development.\n\nIn addition, a number of capital recycling initiatives are currently being explored, including the potential introduction of a capital partner for our Australian Communities and China senior living businesses, as well as the divestment of our remaining 25.1 per cent interest in the Australian retirement living business.\n\n## Outlook\n\nI /firmly believe we have the right strategy in place to deliver on our purpose and provide a sustainable improvement in returns to securityholders.\n\nI'm con/fident we are on track to achieve our core FY24 target of an 8-10 per cent Return on Equity, albeit at the low end of the range. We're also committed to targeting annual completions of $8b and growing FUM to $70b by FY26, providing it remains prudent to do so.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our securityholders for their insight, feedback and understanding throughout the year as we executed our plan to transform\n\nI firmly believe we have the right strategy in place to deliver on our purpose and provide a sustainable improvement in returns to securityholders.\n\nLendlease. I extend my sincere thanks to our investment and project partners for choosing to invest and work alongside Lendlease. I also recognise the critical role our supply chain partners have played, and continue to play, in the cost e/fficient delivery of our projects.\n\nWe are a business that is absolutely responding; in our transformation to be a sustainable and high-performing company for our securityholders, to the opportunities presented in the real estate sector for our partners and customers, and to the state of our planet and climate change.\n\nThis is only possible because we have an enthusiastic global team of people who are highly knowledgeable and rising to the challenges we are facing, and have consistently strived during the past 12 months to create an improved Lendlease.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Lombardo Global Chief Executive O/fficer",

We have decades of experience managing real estate assets, with our expertise spanning multiple asset classes and geographies.\n\nWe have a target of growing FUM to more than $70b by FY26, and in doing so, moving towards a higher proportion of recurring and annuity earnings.\n\nOur $124b development pipeline will continue to deliver seed assets to grow the Investments business, supplemented by expansion into new products, such as value-add strategies.\n\nOur direct Investments portfolio is currently valued at $3.9b and includes co-investment positions in our managed funds and equity interests in our Retirement Living and Military Housing businesses. The portfolio is diversi/fied across the workplace, residential, retail, retirement and industrial sectors.\n\nWe have invested meaningfully in our Investments team and platform and are in the process of scaling up the business in o/ffshore jurisdictions, particularly in the UK and the Americas./uni00A0\n\nWe remain focused on driving best-inclass performance for our investment partners globally. This includes accessing compelling investment opportunities, producing leading ESG performance and optimising investment returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asset creation opportunities\n\nOur develop to core products, derived from our development pipeline, are expected to be a key source of FUM growth. More than 50 per cent of the development pipeline comprises investment yielding assets, including build-to-rent (residential) and A-grade workplaces, which we anticipate will be key future growth sectors.\n\n## Workplace (including Life Sciences and Innovation Districts)\n\nOur global workplace portfolio is our largest contributor to FUM, comprising approximately $27b in largely established assets that are 94 per cent leased.\n\nWe believe there is opportunity for FUM growth in this sector across our target gateway cities. The workplace is essential for businesses to continue to build and create culture and identity and remains fundamental to collaboration and business success. The past year has seen an increase in employees returning to workplaces and we expect this trend to continue given the bene/fits of working in amenity rich environments which drive productivity, collaboration and innovation.\n\nOur $124b development pipeline includes approximately $28b in workplace assets, with more than $4b of future secured workplace FUM currently in delivery.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Melbourne Quarter Tower\n- \u00b7 Victoria Cross Over Station development, North Sydney\n- \u00b7 60 Guest Street, Boston\n\nDuring the year, two workplace developments were completed and are now contributing to FUM, and will continue to mature as they become established assets.\n\n- \u00b7 Salesforce Tower, Sydney Place\n- \u00b7 Blue and William, North Sydney",

        "page_content": "## Build-to-rent (residential)\n\nThe build-to-rent residential asset class has strong growth potential. Institutional capital has signi/ficant interest in this product, driven by housing a/ffordability constraints, an undersupply of a/ffordable housing, strong migration tailwinds and supportive government initiatives.\n\nWe completed our /first build-to-rent development in 2019 and now have more than $3b in FUM across the Americas and the UK. Our development pipeline includes a further c.23,000 apartments for rent, from $28b of potential institutional product.\n\nWe are now applying our strong integrated o/ffshore capabilities to Australia, this year launching two projects in Brisbane and Melbourne.\n\nIn Brisbane we partnered with QuadReal to deliver 443 apartments at the Brisbane Showgrounds precinct, while in Melbourne we partnered with Daiwa House to develop 797 apartments at our Melbourne Quarter precinct. Both projects are set to provide residents with a high-quality, long-term alternative to the traditional apartment rental market and will include premium amenities and communal spaces.\n\n## Retail\n\nRetail is presently our second largest asset class representing approximately 25 per cent of FUM, with an established capability of developing and managing retail assets. Our current portfolio is geographically skewed to the Asia Paci/fic region, with growth in recent years across Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nGoing forward, retail is expected to represent a smaller proportion of our portfolio given the growth we are targeting in other asset classes.\n\n## Data Centres and Industrial\n\nWe see data centres as a key growth area, particularly across Asia, which is well supported by institutional capital partners. Phase One of our data centre in Tokyo, which is 100 per cent pre-leased, with an end value of $0.4b, is due to complete in FY24.\n\n## Social Infrastructure and Other\n\nWe have a strong track record in Social Infrastructure development through our integrated business model and strong /financing capability, leveraged through our established public private partnership (PPP) business, Capella. Through this and other channels, we expect to source further opportunities in this sector./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $48.3b\n\nFunds under management up 9%\n\n## On-market opportunities\n\nAgainst a challenging market and macro environment, progress was made in growing FUM via external opportunities through the launch of new partnerships and the acquisition of new products.\n\n## 21 Moor/fields\n\nWith the support of two investment partners, including NSW TCorp and a key Asian institutional investor, we acquired 21 Moor/fields in London. The A-grade workplace development, located above Moorgate Station, is 100 per cent leased on a 25-year term to Deutsche Bank. It is now contributing $1.4b in FUM and assets under management (AUM), which will become fully established and yielding in FY24.\n\n## Real Estate Partners 4\n\nOur value-add Real Estate Partners 4 fund, which was launched in FY22, acquired four commercial assets in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, with Lendlease co-investing. Utilising our deep o/ffice sector expertise, this fund aims to reposition older assets for future tenant demand. This includes refurbishment to increase sustainability performance and rating and improving the tenant mix.\n\n## Appetite for global real estate\n\nThe top 100 global real estate investors control approximately $1.7t in real estate assets. 1 We have relationships with a large number of them and continue to build out access to European, North American and Asian capital pools which have historically been underrepresented on our Investments platform. While capital partners remain cautious with respect to new investments and markets, given the uncertain market backdrop for rates and global growth, capital remains active in certain sectors, such as build-to-rent and life sciences, where global appetite is driven by strong underlying fundamentals.\n\nLendlease's integrated capability, track record and extensive development pipeline in these areas should support growth in capital partnering.\n\nOur focus on safety and creating innovative and sustainable product, whilst driving investment returns, is also a key di/fferentiator.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nOur asset management business has more than $32b under management across the key asset classes of retail ($11.7b), residential ($15.9b) and workplace ($5.2b). This business is complementary to FUM earnings, also deriving an annuity-style income stream from the management of real assets for our capital partners.\n\nDuring FY23, we took steps to rebalance the residential portfolio, with further sales of 34 per cent of the Military Housing asset management income stream to an existing /financial partner. The sales realised proceeds of $0.2b and allow for the redeployment of capital into higher growth opportunities, with Lendlease retaining 38 per cent ownership of the income stream and 100 per cent ownership of development and construction management rights.\n\n## Leading sustainability targets and credentials\n\nSustainable real estate attracts capital partners and quality tenants, as well as contributing to investment performance and our competitive edge.\n\nOur industry-leading Mission Zero targets aim to lead the transformation of the real estate industry, focusing on the elimination of carbon emissions, not just reduction or o/ffsetting.\n\nWe maintain a leading position across ESG assessments and benchmarks, including GRESB 2 and WELL 3 certi/fications.

This is expected to contribute to more consistent development fee earnings, improved return on invested capital (ROIC) and accelerated FUM growth for our Investments business.\n\n## In Conversion\n\nClose to half of the urban development pipeline, or $50b, is In Conversion, with limited capital investment of $0.3b.\n\nOnce master planning approval is received for a development, it progresses to the Master planned phase where /final building approvals and co-investment are sought before progressing to WIP.\n\nThe timeframe to achieve master planning is typically up to three years from the date a project is secured. On smaller projects, the conversion period may be shorter. /uni00A0\n\n## Master planned\n\nApproximately $51b of the pipeline has master plan approval, supported by total invested capital of $2.3b 1 .\n\nAchieving master planning provides Lendlease with an entitlement to develop, invest, sell down or proceed in phases, accelerate or pause development, or introduce co-investors/ partners depending on prevailing market conditions and commercial priorities.\n\nThe ability to control the development pipeline and recycle capital provides balance sheet /flexibility and optionality.\n\nExcluding the Australian Communities business, the focus for this phase is on obtaining individual building consents, launching products to market via presales or pre-leasing to de-risk execution, and working with our partners/investors to secure capital on speci/fic projects or stages.\n\n## Work in Progress (WIP)\n\nOnce a project begins construction, known as Commencement, it moves into active delivery, progressing to the WIP phase and through to completion. There is currently $23b of WIP with $3.5b of capital employed.\n\nThe Group is targeting through-thecycle completions of $8b annually and maintaining WIP at c.$20b.\n\nIn FY23, 75 per cent of completions represented investment yielding assets.\n\nOur development pipeline will continue to focus on delivery of investment yielding assets, supporting our FUM target of $70b by FY26.",

Invested capital of $6.1b is targeted to reduce by FY26 through capital recycling initiatives, however, Lendlease's capital will work harder, across more projects, by introducing early-stage capital partners to share equity and debt commitments. Over time, this is expected to smooth development fee earnings and ROIC, by increasing the number and frequency of project completions, with a greater proportion of our development capital in production.\n\nThis will include a greater emphasis on joint venture partnerships and the early introduction of co investors, targeting a Lendlease economic interest of less than 50 per cent per project and providing opportunities for origination, development, performance and long-term funds management fees.\n\nCommencements in FY23 alongside joint venture capital partners were:\n\n- \u00b7 One Circular Quay, Sydney: 33% Lendlease\n- \u00b7 Habitat, Los Angeles: 50% Lendlease\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Build-to-rent (BTR)\n\nBTR assets are a highly sought after, investment-grade, asset class, supported by industry fundamentals of housing shortages, government policy, demographic change, city migration trends and investor appetite.\n\nWe have a long history of constructing these assets for clients in the Americas and completed our /first BTR development in 2019. We now have more than $3b in FUM across the UK and the Americas in BTR.

Our experience in delivering large integrated global precincts such as Barangaroo South, Sydney, Elephant Park, London and Paya Lebar Quarter, Singapore, establishes Lendlease as a partner of choice.\n\nThis capability is also a key strategic advantage that is leveraged in origination, demonstrated by the Comcentre project win in Singapore, which was secured in FY22, and more recently the acquisition of 21 Moor/fields in London and One Circular Quay in Sydney.\n\n## Comcentre, Singapore\n\nResponding to a highly competitive tender process from Singtel to transform its Comcentre headquarters into a $3.3b sustainable workplace, Lendlease was the only non-Singaporean company in the process with four other parties.\n\nDrawing on our integrated construction capabilities, including expertise in digital and ESG, we put forward a compelling proposal which incorporated a 'faster and smarter' buildable scheme. Consequently, we were awarded the project which, on completion in FY28, is anticipated to be a world-class sustainable workplace.\n\n## 21 Moor/fields, London\n\nOur construction team was invaluable in supporting the recent acquisition of 21 Moor/fields, a c.52,000sqm commercial o/ffice building in London. The asset, which was only part built by a third-party, was acquired by our Investments team, in conjunction with two capital partners.\n\nThe Construction business provided its expert opinion and risk assessment on the quality of the build, the general contractor and the subcontractors, as well as its view on the potential of the asset performance when completed. Our ability to draw on this expertise was critical in helping us execute this signi/ficant transaction alongside our capital partners./uni00A0",

Leveraging our market knowledge acquired through customer, contract and sector diversity, forms part of this origination strategy.\n\nPrior to the commencement of construction, detailed project management plans are formed and a team with the optimal skill set for the project is chosen. Depending on the contract type, we then go into product design and cost planning.\n\nThe delivery phase comprises construction management, production and program controls, functional reviews and reporting. Post construction, a rigorous commissioning process is undertaken ahead of transitioning to the customer.\n\nThe approach for pricing and managing contract risk varies by jurisdiction. At face value, contracts are largely /fixed price with the risk pro/file dependant on the quality of design resolution and the level of market coverage on the cost. In Australia, our high design management capability, and deep supplier relationships and buying power across the supply chain, provide high con/fidence in the price-setting process. In the UK and the Americas, contracts are typically more than 80 per cent procured before pricing contracts, providing high visibility on costs, while in Asia, projects are generally set on a cost-plus basis, with negligible pricing risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fossil fuel-free construction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur construction capability plays a critical role in the delivery of our urban projects.\n\n## Partnership approach\n\nWorking collaboratively with our partners has been essential in mitigating supply chain risk and achieving our sustainability targets.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nThe continued disruption caused by geopolitical uncertainty highlights the importance of the supply chain in the successful delivery of our projects.\n\nCounteracting disruption by working directly with manufacturers and implementing agreements with strategic partners remains a key focus for the business.\n\nKey areas include:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining deep relationships with our suppliers to proactively manage risk\n- \u00b7 Establishing the right trading partnerships to introduce low embodied carbon materials\n- \u00b7 Building a more connected supply chain via the use of digital technologies\n\nIn 2022, in collaboration with the University of Queensland, we published research into how to decarbonise the construction industry. The industry accounts for 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with approximately 5.5 per cent directly caused by powering construction machinery, primarily through fossil fuels such as mineral diesel.\n\nThe research found that Australia must accelerate the electri/fication of construction machinery, as well as support the creation of a local renewable diesel market. Renewable diesel o/ffers a transition fuel to the industry while it works on converting to electri/fication of construction equipment./uni00A0\n\nIn collaboration with our partners, we've introduced the /first renewable diesel to Australia and onto our project sites, which includes the NSW Government's Powerhouse Parramatta project.\n\nAll three cranes at the site are among the /first in Australia to be powered by 100 per cent renewable diesel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the crane operations by up to 90 per cent, when compared with mineral diesel.\n\nOpposite: Kuala Lumpur: TRX Above: Renewable diesel cranes, Powerhouse Parramatta",

A premium o/ffering in a premium location./uni00A0\n\nWorking to minimise the impacts on the already approved planning application, our development and construction teams re/fined the project design to ensure the viability of the commerce. This included carrying out all necessary due diligence, re/fining the apartment layouts, revising the building engineering solutions and developing a new construction plan and schedule all within a six-week period of becoming exclusive with the vendor.\n\nCritical to securing the transaction was the ability to o/ffer a /firm price in a highly accelerated process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn combination, our three operating segments become powerful and, in our view, provide a sustainable competitive advantage\n\nWith excellent market knowledge, construction expertise and long-term supply chain relationships, our Construction business was capable of providing a detailed assessment of cost, within the desired design parameters, that gave con/fidence to the business to execute the transaction. The experience of the Construction team also allowed for risks to be properly assessed, including evaluating the quality of the commenced basement works.\n\n## Partnership funding\n\nIn line with our capital-e/fficient development strategy and acknowledging more than $800m of capital was needed to acquire the land for the $3.1b 1 project, we introduced one of our trusted partners, Mitsubishi Estate Asia (MEA), to the project.\n\nWith an already deep relationship stretching across several projects, including Salesforce Tower and One Sydney Harbour, MEA recognised One Circular Quay's unique potential and ultimately acquired a 67 per cent interest in the project, with Lendlease retaining 33 per cent.\n\nThe hotel component of the project was forward sold in early 2023 with the majority of the cash consideration paid upfront, de-risking the project. This provided further pricing certainty, as well as locking in development and construction management fees over the life of the development.\n\nTop and opposite: Sydney: Artist's impression of One Circular Quay.",

For example, on some projects we have begun trialling the use of technology applications such as CCTV with an overlay of AI or daily reviews to identify or alert teams to at-risk situations.\n\n## Safety performance\n\nOur approach to health and safety reporting is inclusive of our people, our subcontractors and those who interact with the places we create and manage. During the 93.1/uni00A0million hours worked across our operations in FY23, we continued to improve our performance against a number of key safety metrics. Our Critical Incident Frequency Rate (CIFR) and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) further improved on the high benchmark set in FY22./uni00A0\n\nIn instances of a fatal incident being reported, we defer to the /findings of an independent investigation to determine Lendlease's degree of operational control.\n\nAcross all our operations in FY23, for locations where Lendlease was responsible for the operational control of health and safety outcomes, there are no fatalities to report for FY23. For projects outside our operational control, we report the fatality of a subcontract worker on the 1 Java Street project in New York. Our thoughts continue to be with the family and colleagues of this worker and those impacted by this event.\n\nFor future periods, we are undertaking a review of our approach to safety reporting to ensure alignment with our Investments-led strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Excellence in innovation\n\nWithin the 17-acre Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) integrated development in Malaysia, the TRX Residences o/ffer premier urban homes in an experienceled lifestyle precinct.\n\nTwo towers, each more than /fifty storeys in height, are being built with 896 apartments, cantilevered sky decks, and an interconnecting bridge.\n\nThese impressive buildings require highly complex and challenging safety considerations that have required bold thinking, highly committed planning, and an exceptional commitment to execution.\n\nTo overcome the risks associated with the close proximity to other structures, the overall height of the buildings, and the duration of construction with a transient migrant workforce, the team has implemented several safety initiatives./uni00A0 These include:\n\n- \u00b7 An innovative jump form system (eliminating 300,000 hours of work at height)\n- \u00b7 Installation of the fa\u00e7ade behind perimeter screens (eliminating 300,000 hours of work at height)\n- \u00b7 Utilising stair form for the /fire stairs (allowing for in situ access to the /floors under construction)./uni00A0\n\nThis is the /first time these initiatives have been used in Malaysia, with the TRX Residences team receiving the Gold Award from the Malaysian Occupational Safety and Health Professional Association (MOSHPA) at the National Excellence Awards in 2022.\n\n## Percentage of operations without a critical incident 1\n\n/uni200B\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/uni200B\n\n- 1.

However, we recognise there are challenges ahead and that key to /finding solutions is sharing insights we have gained.\n\n## Limited availability of renewable diesel\n\nAs we work towards fossil fuel-free construction, renewable diesel is an important transition fuel for our sector, but its availability varies across our regions of operation. In Europe, where renewable fuels are more readily accessible, renewable fuels represent 96 per cent of fuel purchased.\n\nIn Australia, we have procured and imported renewable diesel as part of a cross-industry collaboration to demonstrate its viability as a low carbon solution for the construction industry. Trials have been successful however implementation at scale is challenging given limited existing supply.\n\nWe continue to advocate for the local manufacture of renewable diesel in Australia and we are exploring options to increase the supply of renewable diesel in all regions where we operate.\n\n## Eliminating Scope 3 emissions\n\nOur Absolute Zero by 2040 target includes eliminating Scope 3 emissions within the boundaries we have de/fined as being relevant to our value chain. As Scope 3 emissions are the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of third parties, they present a unique challenge because they are not within our direct control.\n\nEliminating Scope 3 emissions in the real estate sector will require collaboration along the building value chain to accelerate the decarbonisation of carbon intensive materials such as steel, cement, aluminium and glass. Detailed tracking of Scope 3 emissions via the digitisation, collection and reporting of Scope 3 emission data across our vast supply chains will also be required.\n\nDespite these challenges, we see opportunities for partnerships between like-minded organisations to spark the investment and innovation needed for industry transformation.

Our disclosure continues to evolve as we enhance our management of climaterelated risks and as advancements are made in the maturity of climate-related /financial disclosures.\n\n## Building strategic resilience\n\nLendlease has previously identi/fied 10 Climate-Related Impacts (CRIs) associated with our three potential climate scenarios: Polarisation (a 3 degree scenario), Paris Alignment (a 2-3 degree scenario) and Transformation (a well below 2 degree scenario). In FY23, Lendlease senior leaders met to review the CRIs for continued relevance. The CRIs were assessed for their ongoing likelihood over the next 10 years and updated accordingly - focusing on /five key CRIs under each scenario. The residual sensitivity under each CRI, by reference to potential impact to revenue, remains unchanged from prior periods including the assessed level of action required to achieve the residual sensitivity.\n\nInitial work was also undertaken on the identi/fication of /financial and non/financial metrics to measure and/or monitor the emergence of the updated CRIs. These metrics span both physical and transition risks and opportunities across all three scenarios.\n\nWith the refresh of the identi/fied CRIs now complete across the three scenarios, Lendlease will continue to monitor the identi/fied climate-related risks and opportunities for signs of the CRIs emerging. This includes expanding the scope of our data capture and analysis to assess the materiality of any potential future impacts to the business.\n\nWhile every e/ffort has been taken to engage in a robust scenario analysis process with input from experienced senior leaders in each business around the globe, scenario planning is, by its nature, subjective and may be subject to change as key considerations evolve. When reviewing the disclosures below, please consider the above factors.\n\n## Emerging Climate-Related Reporting Requirements\n\nIn June 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released its global sustainability\n\ndisclosure standards, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. IFRS S1 provides a set of disclosure requirements designed to enable companies to communicate to investors about the sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities they face over the short, medium and longterm. IFRS S2 sets out speci/fic climaterelated disclosures.\n\nThe Australian government has also con/firmed they intend to introduce standardised, climate-related reporting requirements for businesses, through proposed amendments to the Corporations Act 2001, aligned to the ISSB standards.\n\nThe new reporting requirements are expected to be aligned to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which Lendlease has been following. As a result, it is anticipated that Lendlease will be able to meet the new Australian standard requirements when they are introduced.\n\nTop Left: Manchester: Potato Wharf.\n\nTop Right: London : Elephant Park.",

This delay results in a world where physical climate changes are the greatest across our three scenarios, resulting in signi/ficant disruption.\n\n- \u00b7 Under the higher physical impacts of this scenario, Lendlease recognises a transformation of our strategy is needed in all businesses to manage global supply chains and labour sourcing risks. Even so this would still incur moderate negative sensitivities.\n- \u00b7 The integration of 'Leadership in Sustainability' as a strategic priority and our Net and Absolute Zero Carbon targets sees higher residual positive sensitivities without any further action taken beyond our current strategy.\n\n## Paris Alignment Scenario (2-3 o C)\n\nOur Paris Alignment Scenario sees a market led transition to a lower carbon future through global government commitments to the Paris Agreement, resulting in higher regulation to climate action and with lower physical impacts of climate change compared to our Polarisation scenario.\n\n- \u00b7 Our leadership in sustainability and Mission Zero targets creates positive sensitivities to an increased cost of both carbon and the cost to comply with sustainability / climate legislation and regulation.\n- \u00b7 While there are many 'di/fficult to decarbonise' products and materials in our supply chain, including cement, steel, and aluminium, achieving this goal would result in signi/ficant positive sensitivity to Lendlease.\n\n## Transformation Scenario (<2 o C)\n\nOur Transformation Scenario sees a rapid decarbonisation pathway, where global emissions are close to zero in 2040, driven by society.\n\n- \u00b7 The speed of change that is needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees is likely to create some negative sensitivities in our supply chain as preferences shift towards localisation and would require transformational and adaptive practices to mitigate the impact.\n- \u00b7 Our leadership in sustainability and Mission Zero targets create positive sensitivities to shifting 'social license to operate' expectations and would result in positive sensitivities to Lendlease if we adapt our strategy by accelerating our

This action has retrospective e/ffect by extending the period for defects liability from six years to 30 years and updating building safety regulations for completed UK residential buildings./uni00A0The liability primarily relates to buildings developed by Crosby entities, acquired by Lendlease in 2005. This estimate does not include anticipated recoveries from third parties, including insurances and supply chain. For further details refer to Note 23 in the /financial statements.\n\nThe Group's core Operating Pro/fit after Tax (OPAT) fell by 7 per cent to $257m. Core Operating Earnings per Security of 37.3 cents represents a Return on Equity of 3.8 per cent. Distributions per Security totalled 16.0 cents, unchanged from FY22. This represents a payout ratio of 43 per cent of OPAT.\n\nCore Segment EBITDA fell by 13 per cent to $705m. Improved Development earnings from Communities and increased completions were o/ffset by lower contributions from Investments and Construction. Lower earnings from the Investments segment were due to loss of earnings from current and prior year asset\n\nsales and higher platform costs, as the business continues the pivot to be Investments-led. Construction earnings were lower, with margin pressure amidst di/fficult industry conditions despite a robust performance in Australia.\n\nThe Group's performance was also impacted by provisioning in relation to a divestment and prior projects in the o/ffshore businesses. An additional $110m of post-tax provisions has been booked in relation to claim settlements, remediation obligations and impairment of receivables. This was partially o/ffset by a $50m post-tax gain on the partial repurchase of the Group's Sterling bonds which were trading at a discount to book value.\n\nCorporate costs decreased by 11 per cent to $161m, re/flective of the recent focus on a leaner head o/ffice function and lower bonuses.\n\nAdjusted for the gain on repurchase of the Sterling bonds, net /finance costs were 30 per cent higher, with higher average net debt during the year and an increase in the average cost of debt to 4.3 per cent, re/flecting base rate increases mitigated by a well-positioned hedging strategy.\n\nA Non core loss of $19m primarily re/flects overhead costs associated with the retained elements of the Engineering and Services businesses. We continue to maintain provisions we consider to be appropriate to complete our share of the retained Melbourne Metro project, and for potential warranties associated with the exited Engineering and Services businesses.\n\nThe Group has reached the mid-point of the two-year Create phase of the /five-year Reset, Create, Thrive strategic roadmap to deliver sustained, improved performance. The key elements of the Create phase involve continued growth in funds under management (FUM); achieving scale in development; and maintaining execution excellence in construction.\n\nProgress was made during the year to grow FUM by nine per cent to $48.3b. This included $5.3b of new additions, partially o/ffset by divestments and negative valuation movements. Key activities contributing to growth include the 21 Moor/fields acquisition in London, deployment of investment mandate capital, and investment into new products across build to rent, sustainable o/ffice, value add and life sciences assets.\n\nDevelopment progress was also evident with the acceleration of Work in Progress. There were $7.7b of commencements in the year, including One Circular Quay in Sydney, a $3.1b residential-led project in joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate (67 per cent), as well as Habitat (formerly La Cienega), a $1.1b mixed-use, build to rent/o/ffice project in Los Angeles, with joint venture partner Aware Super (50 per cent). Progress was made with the launch of build to rent projects in Australia, including Melbourne Quarter West and Brisbane Showgrounds, introducing the Group's international capabilities to the Australian market. Build to rent is a key growth product for both the Development and Investments segments.\n\nThe Construction segment continued to pursue execution excellence during the year, with an improved focus on transitioning its portfolio to better risk reward outcomes. The business will no longer bid for third-party residential build to sell projects and, separately, will only bid on external construction projects with a value of more than $150m. These changes should deliver an improved earnings pro/file for securityholders over time given increasing long tail risks across the residential building sector.\n\n/uni00A0",

Distribution payout ratio has been calculated on Core Operating Earnings.\n- 2. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated using the annualised Operating Pro/fit after Tax divided by the arithmetic average of beginning, half and year end invested capital.\n- 3. Through-cycle target based on rolling three to /five year timeline.\n\n## Portfolio Management Framework\n\nThe Portfolio Management Framework (PMF) sets out various /financial targets for our business and provides a framework to guide the decisions we make. It is designed to maximise long-term securityholder value via a diversi/fied risk adjusted portfolio, leveraging the integrated model and the Group's /financial strength. This includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating.\n\nIt provides the structure for both capital allocation and generating through-the-cycle returns across the three operating segments of Investments, Development and Construction.\n\nRe/flecting the evolution of the Group's strategy, evolving market conditions and a continued focus on securityholder returns, external market guidance will focus on Group Return on Equity from FY24, which continues to be the Group's key measure of return for securityholders. The structure of the PMF, and its through-the-cycle targets (not guidance), will continue to support internal capital, investment, and portfolio decisions.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Group remains focused on further executing its Investmentsled strategy, with the aim of delivering a higher proportion of stable and recurring earnings to the Group and its securityholders. Since FY21, more than 10 per cent compound growth per annum in FUM has been achieved, with further double-digit growth required to meet our goal.\n\nInvestments is targeting an increase in FUM growth from $48b in FY23 to $70b by FY26. In part, this will be achieved through the growth of our co-investments portfolio, alongside investment partners. This should see capital in Investments increase towards 60 per cent of total Investment and Development capital from 40 per cent today. To help fund this growth and re-weight our Development portfolio, Development capital is planned to be recycled from o/ffshore over time and redeployed into the Investments business, as well as replenishing the Australian Development pipeline.\n\nThe Development pipeline is pivotal to achieving our overall strategy, with currently more than $60b of investment yielding assets to be delivered across attractive asset classes, including build to rent and sustainable o/ffice. The Group's objective is to accelerate delivery of the pipeline in a capitale/fficient manner alongside investment partners, prioritising completion and delivery of investment products to the funds management platform.\n\nThe journey to become an Investments-led business has begun, with solid progress made against a challenging backdrop. The Group is con/fident it has the right strategy, capital resources and teams in place to deliver for securityholders.",

The Group's assessment of market value of ownership interests.\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Investments segment delivered EBITDA of $332m, down 33 per cent from $497m. The decline in earnings re/flects the reduction in investment portfolio earnings from last year's sale of 24.9 per cent of Keyton (formerly Retirement Living), reduced contributions from funds and asset management, and provisioning against a receivable from the disposal of the Americas Telecommunications business, partially o/ffset by a further 34 per cent selldown of the Military Housing Asset Management income stream.\n\nOPAT for Investments of $245m was down 32 per cent from $361m, representing a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 6.1 per cent. The impact to ROIC of the provision was 1.2 percentage points.\n\nManagement EBITDA, derived from funds management and asset management activities across the Group's Investments platform, was down 27 per cent to $104m.\n\nFunds management EBITDA was $82m, down from $94m, primarily due to higher costs from building out the o/ffshore investment management platforms. Revenue increased to $177m from $172m, supported by growth in funds under management, although the full year impact of FUM earnings growth has not been fully re/flected due to the timing of asset completions and FUM addition./uni00A0\n\nAsset management EBITDA reduced to $22m, down from $47m. The change re/flects the loss of income from the partial sale of Military Housing Asset Management income streams.\n\nInvestment portfolio EBITDA was $228m, down from $356m. Portfolio earnings were impacted by the Americas Telecommunications receivable provision and a reduction of portfolio assets from the 24.9 per cent disposal of Keyton in FY22, partially o/ffset by a gain on sale of Parkway Parade to Lendlease Global Commercial REIT (LREIT).\n\nInvestment distribution yield was lower against the prior year at 3.0 per cent, down from 4.7 per cent. FY23 yields were impacted by deployment of capital into new products that are yet to stabilise (e.g., Real Estate Partners (REP) 4, which targets capital gains in addition to income, and 21 Moor/fields, which is expected to begin generating a yield in 1Q24 following practical\n\ncompletion). Rising interest rates also impacted investment distributions and returns for the year.\n\nThe Group's investment portfolio is valued at $3.9b at FY23, up from $3.5b, an increase of 12.9 per cent. The increase was due to the co-investment in 21 Moor/fields, assets acquired through REP 4 and the transfer of assets from Development including build to rent products, Cascade and City Lights Point.\n\n## Operations\n\nFUM increased nine per cent to $48.3b. The movement was comprised of $5.3b of new FUM, o/ffset by $1.0b of divestments, valuation, and market-related impacts. New FUM contributions were from 21 Moor/fields, MSG North, REP 4 and deployment of investment mandates. In addition to current FUM, there is more than $6b of future secured FUM in delivery from development projects that is planned to move into funds or mandates.\n\nThe Group's develop to core products, derived from its urban development pipeline, are expected to be the primary source of growth for the Investments platform. More than 50 per cent of the urban development pipeline comprises investment yielding assets, derived mostly from build to rent and sustainable o/ffice assets.\n\nAssets under management increased nine per cent to $32.8b. The increase was driven by new AUM of $1.9b, from 21 Moor/fields and Cascade, as well as market-related gains, partially o/ffset by $0.8b of retail asset sales.\n\nThe Group's investment portfolio of $3.9b is well diversi/fied with $1.4b in residential, $1.2b in workplace; $0.9b in retail and the balance in data centres, industrial and other assets.",

Project end value on product completed during a /financial period (representing 100% of project value).\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Development segment delivered EBITDA of $283m, up 56 per cent from $181m. The result was driven by the Australian region, with Asia also contributing an improved result. Europe's performance was negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and a prior project provision, while the Americas also remains challenged due to market conditions. OPAT of $192m was up from $111m, or 73 per cent. The FY23 ROIC of 3.3 per cent was higher than the 2.2 per cent on the prior year.\n\nThe Australian Communities business underpinned the result, generating $142m of EBITDA, up from $16m, with FY22 impacted by planning and weather delays. There were 2,253 lot settlements, up from 1,478, and 1,765 lot sales, down from 3,114. Settlements were lower than anticipated due to delays in obtaining authority approvals for lot registrations, whilst the impact of continued upward pressure on interest rates tempered sales volumes, albeit with sentiment improving in the last few months of the year.\n\nThe Exchange TRX (Retail) in Kuala Lumpur, which is now 87 per cent leased, recorded a gain as it nears completion this year. A joint venture partnership with Daiwa House to develop build to rent apartments at Melbourne Quarter also contributed.\n\nThere were $3.6b of completions for the year, comprised of $2.8b urban projects and $0.8b of Communities development, noting the urban delivery pipeline is still working through pandemic-related delays to completions. Sydney Place, which was divested in FY22, was the key contributor to urban completions, followed by Blue & William, a 14,000sqm workplace project in North Sydney. City Lights Point, London, also delivered 118 build to rent units and 104 apartments for sale.\n\nThere were $7.7b of commencements during the year. One Circular Quay, a $3.1b project in joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate, commenced in Sydney. The project comprises 158 luxury apartments and a luxury hotel that was forward sold, de-risking the project at inception.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a $1.1b mixed-use, build to rent/o/ffice project, Habitat, commenced. The project is in partnership with Aware Super and will provide investment grade product to the funds management platform.\n\nIn Melbourne, a $0.6b build to rent joint venture project commenced alongside Daiwa House, leveraging the Group's existing o/ffshore build to rent capabilities.\n\nHayes Point, a $1.9b mixed-use project comprising apartments for sale, as well as boutique o/ffice space, commenced in San Francisco during 1H23. Following completion of key substructure works, the project was recently paused pending further de-risking through either tenancy pre-commitments or the introduction of a capital partner.\n\n## Operations\n\nThe Development pipeline rose from $117b to $124b, underpinned by the addition of One Circular Quay, Sydney. Excluding Communities, the urban development pipeline was $108b. The Group was announced as preferred developer of the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne. The project has an estimated end development value of $1.7b and, subject to approvals, will comprise a new landmark of sustainable workplace; build to rent apartments; student accommodation alongside student accommodation partner Scape; and a large public park.\n\nInvested capital rose from $5.4b to $6.1b during the year, which includes $1.0b of Australian Communities developments. Key urban projects utilising capital include: One Sydney Harbour; One Circular Quay; The Exchange TRX; Victoria Cross Over Station development; 60 Guest Street; Habitat and Hayes Point. Over time, invested capital in Development is expected to trend down towards 40 per cent of capital invested across Investments and Development.\n\nAs part of the Group's capital management approach, $0.6b was raised from the forward sale of apartment pre-sale contracts (PLLACes) on Residences Two (R2) and Waterman's Residence (R3) at One Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe pipeline in Conversion of $50b is controlled by $0.3b of invested capital with the more capital intense Master planned phase holding $1.4b of capital (ex Communities), with a $51b development pipeline. The Work in Progress (WIP) phase, with projects moving from commencement through to completion, employs $3.5b of capital.\n\nDevelopment WIP, the lead indicator for future completions, was $22.9b, up from $18.4b in the prior year. The business is seeking to maintain WIP above $20b with a focus on accelerating execution.",

Construction revenue earned in period (excludes internal projects).\n- 2. Construction revenue to be earned in future periods (excludes internal projects).\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Construction segment booked revenue of $7.2b for the year, up nine per cent, despite a decline in European activity.\n\nEBITDA of $90m was down 31 per cent, while OPAT of $32m was down 53 per cent, delivering a subdued outcome in the context of industry challenges, including high in/flationary pressures, ongoing supply chain challenges and sub-contractor collapses. EBITDA was also impacted by $53m from provisions relating to prior projects in the Americas and Europe. While in/flationary headwinds remain, they have shown signs of moderating.\n\nEBITDA margin for the segment was 1.2 per cent for the year, down from 2.0 per cent, impacted by provisions which reduced the EBITDA margin by 0.8 percentage points.\n\nThe Australian business remained the largest contributor to earnings, delivering $3.7b of revenue, $105m of EBITDA and $58m of OPAT. Margins at 2.8 per cent were down from 3.8 per cent in FY22 due to industry headwinds. A continued focus on defence and social infrastructure projects supported external revenues for the year.\n\nThe Americas business remains a large revenue contributor, delivering $2.5b, an increase of 10 per cent. However, earnings were negatively impacted by low margins and provisions, leading to a loss after tax of $25m.\n\nAcross other o/ffshore markets, activity slowed in Europe to deliver revenue of $0.7b, down 17 per cent, while Asian activity increased 13 per cent with a revenue contribution of $0.3b. Europe contributed modestly to EBITDA and core OPAT for the year.\n\nConstruction contributed 13 per cent to Group EBITDA, down from 16 per cent in FY22. The contribution to Group EBITDA will trend towards a target of 10 per cent as Investments and Development are expected to increase their proportionate contributions over time.\n\nNew work secured for the segment was $4.7b, down from $5.3b. Australia remained the largest contributor with $2.4b, while the Americas business saw the largest growth in new work to $2.1b. Social infrastructure projects remain the key sector for new work secured, with o/ffice and life science projects also contributing to growth.\n\n## Operations\n\nBacklog revenue remains solid at $8.7b, declining compared to last year due to the fall in new work secured relative to revenue. The workbook is diversi/fied by client and sector, although is concentrated within Australia and the Americas.\n\nThe Australian region has the largest backlog revenue, at $5.7b, with key projects including RAAF Tindal Stage 6 and USFPI Air/field Works, Frankston Hospital Redevelopment, Powerhouse Parramatta and Liverpool Health and Academic Precinct.\n\nThe Americas has backlog revenue of $2.5b across the key sectors of defence and sustainable o/ffice. Backlog revenue remains below historical levels, due to lower project activity post-pandemic and a more selective approach to origination of new work.\n\nThe Construction business is preferred for $9.9b in new projects, including $4.3b of social infrastructure and $3.7b of o/ffice, providing con/fidence that the backlog revenue can be increased to the target ~$10b.",

Movements during the year comprised Operating cash out/flows of $486m, Investing cash out/flows of $758m and\n\nFinancing cash in/flows of $723m. The Group closed the year with cash and cash equivalents of $900m.\n\nCore operating cash out/flows include production spend on majority controlled development projects including Waterman's Residence, being the third residential tower at One Sydney Harbour; Australian Communities; Hayes Point; and Lakeshore East. This was o/ffset by PLLACes proceeds on the second and third residential towers at One Sydney Harbour.\n\nInvesting cash out/flows during the year included the acquisition of 21 Moor/fields, asset acquisitions in REP 4 and APPF Industrial and production spend on jointly controlled development projects including the /first and second residential towers on One Sydney Harbour, The Exchange TRX, Victoria Cross Over Station Development, and the acquisition of One Circular Quay.\n\nThe PLLACes transactions were part of the Group's capital management program, bringing forward cash proceeds from future apartment settlements to fund ongoing project development. The PLLACes product is an established capital management tool that has been deployed across the Group's residential build to sell developments since 2014. There are now four outstanding instruments with a face value of approximately $1.7b, secured against One Sydney Harbour apartment settlements.\n\nThe Group remains in a strong /financial position with $2.6b of liquidity comprised of $0.9b of cash and cash equivalents and $1.7b in available undrawn debt. The debt hedging strategy remains well-positioned, with /fixed debt of 64 per cent and an average drawn debt maturity of 4.4 years, decreasing due to the further utilisation of /floating rate facilities in the year and the partial buy back of long-dated Sterling bonds.\n\nGearing of 14.8 per cent at year end is within the target range of 10-20 per cent.

These are scheduled in each of the regions where Lendlease operates on a rotational basis.\n\nThe Board views that these program activities - in addition to the formal, scheduled Board and Committee meetings - are important for Board members to receive a greater understanding of our people and our business and a deep understanding of the activities and operations. The Chair works with the Company Secretary to plan the yearly program. Depending on the time of year, the program runs for a minimum of two days and up to /five days where more detailed project reviews are required.\n\n## Program for the reporting period between 1 July 2022 and/uni00A030 June 2023.\n\nBoard program activities undertaken during the reporting period are listed below.\n\n## Asia\n\n- \u00b7 Site visit of Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) Malaysia (Retail and Residences).

(July 2022)\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board members, led by the Chairman, maintain an active and extensive engagement program to represent the interests of the Group. The Chairman acts as a spokesperson and regularly meets with customers, investors, governments and media. In February 2022, the Board endorsed a refreshed investor engagement program to encourage two way communications with the investment community. As part of this, a presentation detailing the scope of the Board activities and focus areas for the Board Committees was made available on the ASX announcements platform and on the Lendlease website in June 2023.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting (AGM) has always been an important date in our calendar and provides our securityholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with the Board. In 2023, Lendlease will continue to hold the AGM in a hybrid format. This will provide both an 'in-person' and virtual component which will allows greater access to our securityholders to participate, ask questions and vote on all resolutions.\n\n## Board engagement with our people\n\nThe Board members have approved a code of conduct which articulates the standards of behaviour expected of all our people. The tone is 'set at the top' and Board members believe that meeting with our people, in addition to information received in formal meetings on the organisation's culture, is an important element of reinforcing the Lendlease values. The Board members meet regularly with local Lendlease management and employees. These events typically take the form of employee 'town hall' style events. The Board members encourage employees to ask questions at these sessions which provide the opportunity for open and honest debate on organisational culture. In FY23, these events occurred in all Lendlease regions.\n\n/uni00A0",

It is located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and was identi/fied by the Malaysian Government to transform the broader TRX precinct into a world-class business and /financial hub. The project\n\nwill encompass a new international /financial district underpinned by a world-class residential, retail, leisure and cultural o/ffering.\n\nCommencing in 2015, the Board was introduced to the opportunity to deliver a landmark, mixed-use development at The Exchange, Malaysia. The project is delivered through Lendlease's integrated business model, allowing the project team to respond to the needs of all stakeholders throughout entire property value chain. After careful consideration, approval was provided to bid for the project. Due to the project's size and signi/ficance, the Board has continued to receive updates on the progress of The Exchange and initially visited the project in 2018, prior to commencement of construction. Throughout 2020 and 2021 when travel restrictions were in place, the Board visited the site virtually, where an aerial /flythrough of the project was provided to show the pace of construction since the Board's last in-person visit. Updates on the project were also provided\n\nat regular intervals throughout this period. These updates have centred on /financial and commercial assessments, key risks, safety and sustainability issues and macro economic indicators. Whilst not exhaustive, these factors were indicative of the issues considered during Boardroom discussions. In March 2023, the Board returned in person to see the progress of the retail centre and the residences. In visiting the site over a longer time frame, the Board's discussions on the project's risks and opportunities were appreciated in a fuller geographic context.\n\nThe Board's interactions with The Exchange team, before, during and after completion of delivery, including visits, tours, presentations and project team interactions are indicative of the scrutiny and governance undertaken by the Board to oversee the delivery of projects in accordance with the Group's strategy.\n\nTop: Kuala Lumpur , Board Visit to TRX Exchange",

The Group's Statutory Loss after Tax for the year was $232m, after recording a provision of $295m due to retrospective UK Government action, a revaluation loss of $175m relating to property revaluations in the Investments segment, and a Non core segment loss of $19m.\n\nNotwithstanding these external challenges, the Group made signi/ficant progress on our strategic objectives as part of the 'Create' phase of our /five-year Reset, Create, Thrive business strategy. This includes progress towards our Investments led business model, leveraging our development pipeline and our construction capability, as well as continued progress in achieving our ESG targets. The Group's core Operating Pro/fit after Tax fell by 7 per cent to $257m. Core Operating Earnings per Security of 37.3 cents represents a Return on Equity of 3.8 per cent. Distributions per Security totalled 16.0 cents, unchanged from FY22. This represents a payout ratio of 43 per cent of OPAT.\n\nThe safety of our people and those working with us is our highest priority and a core focus for the Committee during the year. Whilst recognising the Group's success in achieving a record low Critical Injury Frequency Rate, we were saddened during the year with the loss of one of our sub-contractor's worker. While the work was not under the operational control of Lendlease, we nevertheless paused site operations and undertook a global safety review. The safety review enabled us time to re/flect on the learnings from this incident and reinforced our commitment to advocacy for industry change to meet the safety standards expected by Lendlease.\n\n## FY23 Executive Reward Strategy and outcomes\n\nSigni/ficant changes to the Executive Reward Strategy were made in FY22 following securityholder engagement to enhance the structure of our remuneration framework. As a result, minimal changes were required to the Executive Reward Strategy during FY23.\n\nThe Group did not meet our performance targets for Operating Pro/fit, Completions and Construction EBITDA margin. However, there was on or above target performance across Investments EBITDA,\n\nSafety, Sustainability, Customer and People KPIs.\n\nGiven the Group's /financial performance and a fatality of a sub-contractor, the Board exercised downward discretion to STA scorecard outcomes, resulting in reduced bonus awards to the Global Leadership Team. The STA payment for the CEO re/flects 32% of maximum, and for the other KMP ranged between 25% and 46% of maximum.\n\nThere was no vesting of the 2021 LTA given the performance hurdles were not met.\n\nWe believe that the remuneration outcomes for executives appropriately re/flect the performance of the Group and are aligned to the experience of our securityholders.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nThe fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are reviewed and benchmarked annually against relevant comparators.\n\nNo increases to Non-Executive Directors fees were made in FY23.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Group enters FY24 having made signi/ficant progress against our strategic objectives. We are excited with the opportunities presented by our record development pipeline, which supports the delivery of our Portfolio Management Framework return targets.\n\nAt the same time, we acknowledge the impact the challenging market environment has had on our /financial performance, and hence on returns to securityholders. Accordingly, in FY24 the Group will continue to focus on improving our /financial performance. As part of this we continue to seek opportunities to improve the e/fficiency of our operations, and recently announced the di/fficult decision to reduce our workforce by a further 10%.\n\nThe STA scorecard has been re/fined to provide greater emphasis on /financial return and to focus on fewer measures. In addition, the LTA framework has been amended to replace the FUM growth measure with Investments ROIC, providing closer alignment to securityholder outcomes.\n\nThe Group will build on the signi/ficant improvement in employee engagement achieved in FY23. The Committee will introduce an all-employee equity plan to further align the interests of all employees across the globe with the performance of the Group and our securityholders.\n\nWe invite you to read the remuneration report outlining the outcomes for key management personnel during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElizabeth Proust, AO\n\nChairman, People & Culture Committee",

the LTA as a third measure to support the key strategic objective of increasing Lendlease's Investments platform globally.\n\nGiven the Group's strategic focus to become Investments led, retention of an Investments performance metric is an important component of our reward framework./uni00A0 To encourage a disciplined growth pro/file, and reinforce alignment to the Group's stated Portfolio Management Framework (PMF), IM ROIC will be introduced into the LTA metric assessment from FY24, replacing the FUM growth element as an equally weighted measure. This long term measure re/flects the segment's capital intensive nature and will assess the ability to generate acceptable earnings, which further aligns with the securityholder experience and a greater mix of stable recurring earnings.\n\nThe FY24 IM ROIC target will be set within the range provided under the Group's Portfolio Management Framework which is currently between 6% and 9%. The performance measurement will be based on the average IM ROIC results over the relevant performance period.",

However, the Board exercised its discretion to make a further downward adjustment in respect of the overall /financial result.\n\nThe Board also took into account the impact of safety incidents - refer further to discussion in the section following.\n\nAccordingly, the Board have exercised discretion to reduce the outcome on both the /financial and non-/financial KPIs.\n\n- \u00b7 A total downwards adjustment of 15% has been applied to the metricated scorecard outcome for the Global CEO.\n- \u00b7 The /final adjusted Global CEO STA outcome is 32% of maximum opportunity.\n\n## Impact of Safety Incidents on FY23 STA Outcomes\n\nAlthough no fatalities occurred on works under Lendlease operational control in FY23, we are deeply saddened by a fatal incident involving a subcontractor worker that occurred on one of our project sites under the operational control of a supply chain partner.\n\nWe go beyond regulatory reporting requirements and report all incidents, working hours and fatalities on our sites as we do not consider the lives of contractors, subcontractors, consultants and community members are any di/fferent to our employees.

At the end of FY23, the Group reached the mid-point of the two-year Create phase of the /five-year Reset; Create; Thrive roadmap to deliver sustained, improved performance. The key elements of the Create phase involve continued growth in funds under management (FUM); achieving scale in development; and maintaining execution excellence in construction.\n\nKey outcomes delivered in FY23 against the strategic roadmap are:\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in funds under management of 9% to $48.3bn.\n- \u00b7 Development Work in Progress of $22.9bn providing continuing strong momentum as we enter FY24, on the pathway to delivering annual completions in excess of $8bn by FY24.\n- \u00b7 Secured One Circular Quay with an estimated end value of $3.1bn to support replenishing the Australian Development pipeline, along with being announced as preferred developer for the Queen Victoria Market, with an estimated end value of $1.7bn.\n- \u00b7 Delivering a resilient Construction result in the context of industry challenges.\n- \u00b7 Re/fining the Construction platform's target portfolio to re/flect a lower risk book going forward.\n\nIn applying the discretion embedded in the Executive Reward Strategy, the Board had regard to these and other factors when assessing the appropriate balance between pay for performance in the form of STA and securityholder outcomes for FY23.

At the time of grant, this incentive re/flected the criticality and scope of the GDV project. The award is structured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 70% of Performance Rights is subject to the achievement of the key milestones for GDV during the performance period, including the securing of entitlements and capital plans and the commencement of construction for each project.\n- \u00b7 30% of Performance Rights is subject to customer satisfaction feedback from the client and internal stakeholders at key touchpoints in the project life cycle, so that GDV milestones are not only delivered within the required timeframes but also to an exceptional standard.\n- \u00b7 There is no retesting on any portion of the GDV award that does not vest.\n\nThe Board retains an overarching discretion to reduce or forfeit any unvested awards if it considers that the vesting of the awards would result in receipt of a bene/fit that was unwarranted or inappropriate.\n\nFor full details of the key terms of the incentive, refer to the Appendix 3G lodged with the ASX on 1 April 2022.\n\nAs Denis Hickey's role was made redundant, under the terms of the award any unvested portion remains on foot.\n\nIn FY23, the Board exercised discretion to carry out an interim assessment on the 70% performance milestones component of the GDV. As a result, it was determined that 51% of the total award will lapse based on past milestone outcomes during FY22 and FY23. The balance of the grant remains subject to testing against key milestones and performance goals.\n\n## STA adjustment\n\nIn addition to the partial lapsing of the GDV award, the Board exercised further discretion to adjust down Denis Hickey's deferred STA on foot by 5%. This adjustment relates directly to the FY23 fatality. Refer to the section 'Impact of Safety Incidents on FY23 STA Outcomes' for more information.",

Security based payments re/flect the accounting expense on a fair value basis. Security based payments are issued either as indeterminate rights and performance rights or as deferred securities. LTI/LTA includes the accounting expense for the RSA. For Denis Hickey, this also includes the accounting expense for his GDV award.\n- 3. Includes the payment of cash allowances such as motor vehicle allowance and the value of the distriibution amounts paid as cash on the RSA. For Neil Martin this also includes cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.\n- 4. Re/flects 50 per cent of the FY23 STA that is paid as cash in September 2023.\n- 5. Non monetary bene/fits may include items such as car parking, relocation and expatriate bene/fits (such as house rental, health insurance, shipping of goods and tax return preparation), motor vehicle costs, travel bene/fits and annual leave.\n- 6. Superannuation includes the value of insurance premiums funded by Lendlease for Australian Executives who are members of the Lendlease default superannuation fund.\n- 7. Other Long Term Bene/fits represents the accrual of long term leave entitlements (e.g. long service leave).\n- 8. Includes a grossed-up reportable fringe bene/fit amount of $18,160 for the year ended 31 March 2023 which primarily relates to the ongoing storage of goods following Anthony Lombardo's relocation to Australia in 2021.\n- 9. Includes a grossed-up reportable fringe bene/fit amount of $33,877 for the year ended 31 March 2023 which primarily relates to professional services rendered for assistance with Dale Connor's US tax a/ffairs.\n- 10.Claire Johnston was appointed to the CEO, Americas role on 1 November 2022 and remuneration re/flects time as KMP.\n- 11. Frank Krile's annual leave taken exceeded his accrued leave for the year.\n- 12.Denis Hickey ceased as KMP on 31 October 2022 and remuneration re/flects time as KMP.\n- 13.As Denis Hickey's role was made redundant and considered a 'Good Leaver', unvested equity awards remain on foot and subject to the original vesting conditions. The security based payment accounting expense for FY23 therefore includes unvested award expenses that have been accelerated and disclosed in total for FY23, including those amounts which would otherwise have been included in future year disclosures.

The consolidated /financial report of the Company for the /financial year ended 30 June 2023 comprises the Company and its controlled entities including Lendlease Trust (LLT) (together referred to as the Consolidated Entity or the Group). The Group is a for pro/fit entity and is an international property and investments group. Further information about the Group's primary activities is included in Note 1 'Segment/uni00A0Reporting'.\n\nShares in the Company and units in LLT are traded as one security under the name of Lendlease Group on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The Company is deemed to control LLT for accounting purposes and therefore LLT is consolidated into the Group's /financial report. The issued units of LLT, however, are not owned by the Company and are therefore presented separately in the consolidated entity Statement of Financial Position within equity, notwithstanding that the unitholders of LLT are also the shareholders of the Company.\n\nThe consolidated /financial report was authorised for issue by the Directors on 14 August 2023.\n\n## Section D./uni00A0Risk Management\n\n| 24.

At June 2023, all values have been rounded o/ff to the nearest/uni00A0million dollars unless otherwise indicated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- \u00b7 Is prepared under the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities, which are stated at their fair value: derivative /financial instruments, fair value through pro/fit or loss investments, investment properties, and liabilities for cash settled share based compensation plans. Recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are stated at fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged. Refer to the speci/fic accounting policies within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the basis of valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting policies have been:\n\n- \u00b7 Included in the relevant notes to which the policies relate, while other signi/ficant accounting policies are discussed in Note 38 'Other Signi/ficant Accounting Policies'\n- \u00b7 Consistently applied to all /financial years presented in the consolidated /financial statements and by all entities in the Group, except as explained in Note 37 'Impact of New and Revised Accounting Standards'.\n\nThe preparation of a /financial report that complies with AASBs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n\n- \u00b7 This can a/ffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates\n- \u00b7 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively\n- \u00b7 The signi/ficant accounting policies highlight information about accounting judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi/ficant e/ffects on reported amounts and further information about estimated uncertainties that have a signi/ficant risk of resulting in material adjustments within the next /financial year\n- \u00b7 These signi/ficant accounting estimates and judgements have been considered in the context of the current economic conditions.\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position as current or non current.\n\n- \u00b7 Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Group's operating cycle or within the next 12 months. All other assets are classi/fied as non current\n- \u00b7 Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Group's operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are classi/fied as non current.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the Group is in a net current de/ficit (current liabilities exceeds current assets) but does not anticipate a signi/ficant liquidity risk in the next 12 months. This is due to the Group's strong /financial pro/file, which includes signi/ficant committed undrawn facilities and low gearing ratios.\n\nThe /financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. In preparing the /financial statements, including assessing the going concern basis of accounting, the Group has considered the general market conditions.\n\n## The Group has:\n\n- \u00b7 $1,681/uni00A0million in undrawn facilities. See Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'\n- \u00b7 $900/uni00A0million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents'.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Group is well placed to manage its /financing and future commitments over the next 12 months from the date of the /financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Section A./uni00A0Performance\n\nIn addition to the statutory result, Operating Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (Operating EBITDA) and Operating Pro/fit after Tax (Operating PAT) are the key measures used to assess the Group's performance. This section of the Financial Report focuses on disclosure that enhances a user's understanding of Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT. Segment Reporting below provides a breakdown of pro/fit and revenue by the operational activity and region. The key line items of the Income Statement, along with their components, provide detail behind the reported balances. Group performance will also impact the earnings per stapled security and dividend payout, therefore disclosure on these items has been included in this section. Further information and analysis on performance and allocation of resources can be found in the Performance and Outlook section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 1./uni00A0Segment Reporting\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group's segments are Investments, Development, Construction and Non core. The Group has identi/fied these operating segments based on the distinct products and services provided by each segment, the distinct target return pro/file and allocation of resources for each segment, and internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Global Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director (the Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing performance, determining the allocation of resources, setting operational targets, and managing the Group.\n\nThe Group has presented the segments around business activity due to the Group's business model being broadly consistent in all regions. Additional disclosure has also been included for Operating EBITDA, Operating PAT and Statutory Pro/fit by region.\n\nThe Group reports Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT as its primary earnings metrics, in addition to the statutory result. Operating PAT is de/fined as Statutory pro/fit adjusted for Investment property revaluations (including in Other /financial assets and Equity accounted investments) that are classi/fied in the Investment segment, and material one-o/ff items that could not reasonably have been expected to arise from normal operations. Operating EBITDA is before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT includes revaluation increases or decreases of Investment properties under construction that are classi/fied in the Development segment.\n\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker receives information and assesses segment performance under these metrics. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain reportable segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. The Group does not consider corporate activities to be an operating segment.\n\nThe operating segments are as follows:\n\n## Investments\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Services include owning and/or managing investments. The segment includes an investment management platform and the Group's ownership interests in residential, o/ffice, retail, industrial, retirement and infrastructure investment assets.\n\n## Development\n\nOperates in all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the development of inner city mixed use developments, apartments, communities, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure. Construction margin earned on development projects is recognised in this segment.\n\n## Construction\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the provision of project management, design and construction services, predominantly in the commercial, residential, mixed use, defence and social infrastructure sectors.\n\n## Non core\n\nNon core includes the provision of project management, design and construction services in the Australian infrastructure sector. These products and services represent the retained Engineering and retained Services projects. The discontinued operations referenced throughout the /financial statements are included in this segment. Discontinued operations represent the Engineering and Services businesses sold in previous periods, excluding the projects retained by the Group.",

This is a key performance measure for the Group. Refer to further details in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section of this Annual Report.\n\nBasic EPS/EPSS is determined by dividing Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group (excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares/securities) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding during the /financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares/securities issued during the /financial year.\n\nDiluted EPS/EPSS is determined by adjusting the Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares/ securities. The Group currently does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares/securities. Dilution occurs when treasury shares and employee share options are included in outstanding shares.\n\nThe issued units of Lendlease Trust (LLT) are presented separately within equity, and therefore the pro/fit attributable to LLT is excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per Company share presented in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                                                            |       | JUNE 2023                                            | JUNE 2023                     | JUNE 2022                                            | JUNE 2022                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                            |       | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) 1                                   |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| (Loss) attributable to members of Lendlease Corporation  Limited (Company) | $m    | (278)                                                | (278)                         | (239)                                                | (239)                         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares                                 | m     | 683                                                  | 689                           | 683                                                  | 689                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPS                                                          | cents | (40.7)                                               | (40.3)                        | (35.0)                                               | (34.7)                        |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Stapled Security (EPSS) 1                       |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| (Loss) attributable to securityholders of Lendlease Group                  | $m    | (232)                                                | (232)                         | (99)                                                 | (99)                          |\n| Weighted average number of stapled securities                              | m     | 683                                                  | 689                           | 683                                                  | 689                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPSS 2                                                       | cents | (34.0)                                               | (33.7)                        | (14.5)                                               | (14.4)                        |\n\n- 1.

Development services include development fees earned on development of inner city mixed use developments, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure.\n\nContracts with customers to provide Construction or Development services can include either one performance obligation or multiple performance obligations within each contract. The Group assesses each of its contracts individually and where there are separate performance obligations identi/fied, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices of the services provided. Typically, the Construction or Development services in contracts are not considered distinct as the services are highly interrelated and an integrated bundle of services and therefore are accounted for as a single performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of contract variations or modi/fications, and contract claims (collectively, 'Modi/fications'). Variable consideration may also include performance or other incentive fees. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer per the contract.\n\nVariable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur, which is an area of accounting judgement. Factors considered in assessing whether the estimated revenue associated with Modi/fications should be recognised include the following:\n\n- i. Status of negotiations with customers\n- ii. The contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the Modi/fications\n- iii. Additional costs incurred were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and for which entitlement contractually exists\n- iv. Modi/fication related costs are identi/fiable, measurable, and considered reasonable in view of the work performed\n- v. Evidence supporting the Modi/fication is objective and veri/fiable, which may include independent third-party advice\n- vi. Commercial and market factors speci/fic to the Modi/fications\n- vii. Historical experience in resolving Modi/fications.\n\nThis assessment is reviewed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances change during the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is recognised over time, typically based on an input method using an estimate of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs. These contracts are typically executed on the customer's land so they control the assets as they are being built or the customer bene/fits from the service as the work is performed. Di/fferences between amounts recognised as revenue and amounts billed to customers are recognised as contract assets or liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nThe measurement of revenue is an area of accounting judgement. Management uses judgement to estimate:\n\n- i. Progress in satisfying the performance obligations within the contract, which includes estimating contract costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations\n- ii. The probability of the amount to be recognised as variable consideration for approved variations and claims where the /final price has not been agreed with the customer.\n\nRevenue is invoiced based on the terms of each individual contract, which may include a periodic billing schedule or achievement of speci/fic milestones. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is/uni00A0issued.\n\nA provision for loss making contracts is recorded for the di/fference between the expected costs of ful/filling a contract and the expected remaining economic bene/fits to be received where the forecast remaining costs exceed the forecast remaining bene/fits.\n\n## Investment services\n\nInvestment services include funds management, asset management, leasing and origination services.\n\nEach contract with a customer to provide Investment services is typically one performance obligation with revenue recognised over time as services are rendered. Typically, our performance obligation is to manage a client's capital and/or property for a speci/fied period of time and is delivered as a series of daily performance obligations over time.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of performance fees. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur. The Group assesses probability of receiving variable consideration using a combination of commercial and market factors, and historical experience.\n\nRevenue is invoiced either monthly or quarterly based on the terms of each individual contract. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is issued.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Sale of Development Properties\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential land lots and built form products, including residential apartments, commercial and retail buildings. Sales of residential land lots and apartments typically are recognised at a point in time, with each contract treated as a single performance obligation to transfer control of an asset to a customer. Residential land lots and apartments are recognised on settlement with the customer.\n\nThe sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets may include land, construction, development management and investment service components. Where there are multiple components within one contract, the transaction price is allocated based on the standalone selling prices of each component, typically using the residual approach, and revenue is recognised based on the policies noted above. Sales of commercial and retail buildings are recognised when the customer obtains control of the asset based on the speci/fic terms and conditions of the sales contract.\n\nThe Group discounts deferred proceeds to re/flect the time value of money where the period between the transfer of control of a development property and receipt of payment from the customer exceeds one year. Deferred proceeds from customers are recognised in trade and other receivables where the right to receive payment is unconditional. Deposits received in advance from customers are recognised as a contract liability until the performance obligation has been met.\n\nThe measurement of revenue from the sale of development properties is an area of accounting judgement as it requires management to exercise judgement in valuing the individual components of a development property sale, given the due consideration to cost inputs, market conditions and commercial factors. The recognition and determination of when control passes requires management judgement and is considered an area of accounting judgement.\n\nProceeds from the sale of residential land lots and apartments are received upon settlement, which typically occurs between 6-12/uni00A0weeks following practical completion on the asset. Proceeds from the sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets are received in accordance with the speci/fic terms of each contract.\n\nThe Group may enter a PLLACes (Presold Lendlease Apartment Cash Flows) transaction for certain residential apartment buildings from time to time. This involves the Group receiving an upfront cash in/flow from third party investors (investors) in exchange for selling the investors the rights to the cash proceeds that are due from customers once the apartments are completed. When customers settle their apartments the Group does not receive any cash proceeds nor does it pay any amounts to the investors as the customers pay the investors directly. On entry into a PLLACes transaction the cash in/flow is disclosed as an operating cash in/flow in the Statement of Cash Flows which typically occurs over a year in advance of the revenue recognition from the sale of the apartments. At the same time, an Other payables - PLLACes is also recognised within Trade and Other Payables and is derecognised as revenue once settlement of the apartments occurs.\n\n|                                                 | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Revenue from the provision of services          |                |                |\n| Core Construction services                      | 7,191          | 6,572          |\n| Non core Construction services                  | 499            | 433            |\n| Construction services                           | 7,690          | 7,005          |\n| Investment services                             | 261            | 279            |\n| Development services                            | 1,483          | 928            |\n| Total revenue from the provision of services    | 9,434          | 8,212          |\n| Revenue from the sale of development properties | 795            | 610            |\n| Total revenue from contracts with customers 1   | 10,229         | 8,822          |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## 7./uni00A0Other Expenses\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nOther expenses in general are recognised as incurred.\n\n## Employee Bene/fit Expenses\n\nEmployee bene/fits are expensed as the related service by the employee is provided and includes both equity and cash based payment transactions. Employee bene/fits recognised in the Income Statement are net of recoveries.\n\nFor cash bonuses, the Group recognises an accrued liability for the amount expected to be paid. This is based on a formula that takes into consideration the pro/fit attributable to the Group's securityholders after certain adjustments. Refer to Note 35a 'Short Term Incentive (STI)' for further detail.\n\n## Share Based Compensation\n\nThe Group operates equity settled share based compensation plans that are linked to Lendlease's security price. The fair value of the equity received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense and a corresponding increase in equity, in the Equity Compensation Reserve. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the securities granted.\n\nThe fair value is primarily determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. Refer to Note 35h 'Amounts Recognised in the Financial Statements' for further detail. Management considers the fair value assigned to be an area of estimation uncertainty as it requires judgements on Lendlease's security price and whether vesting conditions will be satis/fied.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the entitlement due. It recognises the impact of revision of original estimates on non market conditions, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. Changes in entitlement for equity settled share based compensation plans are not recognised if they fail to vest due to market conditions not being met.\n\n## Superannuation Accumulation Plan Expense\n\nAll employees in the Australia region are entitled to bene/fits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's superannuation accumulation plan. The majority of these employees are party to a de/fined contribution plan and receive /fixed contributions from the Group. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee bene/fit expense when they are due. The Group also operates a de/fined bene/fit superannuation plan, membership of which is now closed. Refer to Note 34 'De/fined Bene/fit Plans' for further detail.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets, subject to impairment tests, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The calculation of this recoverable amount is dependent on the type of asset. The material assets' accounting policies will contain further information on these calculations.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n## Reversals of Impairment\n\nImpairment losses on assets can be reversed (other than goodwill) when there is a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount. The increase could be due to a speci/fic event, the indication that impairment may no longer exist or there is a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n## Lease Expense\n\nShort term lease and low value lease payments, including outgoings, are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortisation\n\nDepreciation on owned assets is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment. Amortisation is provided on leasehold improvements over the remaining term of the lease. Most plant is depreciated over a period not exceeding 20 years, furniture and /fittings over three to 15 years, motor vehicles over four to eight years and computer equipment over three years.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.",

The discount is then recognised as /finance revenue over the remaining life of the /financial instrument.\n\nFinance costs include interest, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of new borrowings facilities.

Finance costs are expensed immediately as incurred unless they relate to acquisition and development of qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than six months to prepare for their intended use or sale. Finance costs related to qualifying assets are capitalised.\n\n|                                                    | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Finance Revenue                                    |                |                |\n| Other corporations                                 | 13             | 3              |\n| Other /finance revenue                             | 8              | 3              |\n| Total interest /finance revenue                    | 21             | 6              |\n| Interest discounting                               | 1              | 3              |\n| Gain on repurchase of commercial notes 1           | 63             | -              |\n| Total /finance revenue                             | 85             | 9              |\n| Finance Costs                                      |                |                |\n| Interest expense in relation to other corporations | 174            | 113            |\n| Interest expense in relation to lease liabilities  | 15             | 17             |\n| Less:  Capitalised interest /finance costs 2       | (30)           | (25)           |\n| Total interest /finance costs                      | 159            | 105            |\n| Non interest /finance costs                        | 14             | 20             |\n| Total /finance costs                               | 173            | 125            |\n| Net /finance costs                                 | (88)           | (116)          |\n\n- 1.

Income tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Under current Australian income tax law, LLT is not liable for income tax, including capital gains tax, to the extent that unitholders are attributed the taxable income of LLT.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the /financial year, using applicable tax rates (and tax laws) at the balance sheet date in each jurisdiction, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous /financial years.\n\nDeferred tax is the expected tax payable in future periods as a result of past transactions or events and is calculated by comparing the accounting balance sheet to the tax balance sheet. Temporary di/fferences are provided for any di/fferences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities between the accounting and tax balance sheets. The following temporary di/fferences are not provided for:\n\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of taxable goodwill\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit\n- \u00b7 Di/fferences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using applicable tax rates (and tax laws) at the balance sheet date. The Company is monitoring the global progress toward the enactment of proposed new Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rules under Pillar 2 on the introduction of a global minimum tax, which the Company will be subject to upon implementation. The Company has applied the exceptions to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 2 income taxes as prescribed in AASB 112 Income Taxes .\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is only to the extent it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available so as the related tax asset will be realised. Deferred tax assets may include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Deductible temporary di/fferences\n- \u00b7 Unused tax losses\n- \u00b7 Unused tax credits.\n\nManagement considers the estimation of future taxable pro/fits to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a change in any of the assumptions used in budgeting and forecasting would have an impact on the future pro/fitability of the Group. The Group prepares /financial budgets and forecasts, covering a /five year period, which are reviewed on a regular basis. These forecasts and budgets form the basis of future pro/fitability to support the carrying value of the deferred tax assets. The performance of the Group is in/fluenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions, which are outside the control of the Group, including the level of in/flation, interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, ability to access funding, oversupply and demand conditions and government /fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies.\n\nPresentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities can be o/ffset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on di/fferent tax entities, but are intended to be settled on a net basis or to be realised simultaneously.\n\n## Tax Consolidation\n\nThe Company is the head entity of the Australian Tax Consolidated Group comprising all the Australian wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding LLT. As a consequence, all members of the Australian Tax Consolidation Group are taxed as a single entity.",

This section includes disclosures for property such as Inventories and indirect property assets such as Equity Accounted Investments and Other Financial Assets contained within the Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## 11./uni00A0Inventories\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Development Properties\n\nProperty acquired for development and sale in the ordinary course of business is carried at the lower of cost and Net Realisable Value (NRV).\n\nThe cost of development properties includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the property, preparing it for sale and borrowing costs incurred.\n\nThe NRV is the estimated selling price, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Management considers the estimation of both selling prices and costs of completion to be an area of estimation uncertainty, as these estimations take into consideration market conditions a/ffecting each property and the underlying strategy for selling the property.\n\nThe recoverable amount of each property is assessed at each balance date and accounting judgement is required to assess whether a provision is raised where cost (including costs to complete) exceeds NRV.\n\nInventories are expensed as cost of sales in the Income Statement. Management uses accounting judgement in determining the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The apportionment of cost of sales through sales revenue\n- \u00b7 The amount of cost of sales, which includes costs incurred to date and /final forecast costs\n- \u00b7 The nature of the expenditure, which may include acquisition costs, development costs, borrowing costs and those costs incurred in preparing the property for sale.\n\n## Construction Contract Assets\n\nThe gross amount of Construction and Development Work in Progress consists of costs attributable to work performed, including recoverable pre contract and project bidding costs and emerging pro/fit after providing for any foreseeable losses. In applying the accounting policies on providing for these losses, accounting judgement is required.\n\nConstruction contract assets are presented as part of inventories for all contracts in which revenue recognised (costs incurred plus recognised pro/fits) exceed progress billings. If progress billings and/or recognised contract losses exceed revenue recognised, then the di/fference is presented in Trade and other payables as a Construction contract liability.\n\n|                              | Note   | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Current                      |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 968            | 792            |\n| Construction contract assets | 21.a   | 594            | 664            |\n| Other                        |        | -              | 3              |\n| Total current                |        | 1,562          | 1,459          |\n| Non Current                  |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 2,681          | 2,320          |\n| Total non current            |        | 2,681          | 2,320          |\n| Total inventories            |        | 4,243          | 3,779          |\n\n- 1. The Group has considered the impacts of economic conditions on its recoverability assessment of inventories at 30 June 2023. As part of its semi annual review of development property projects, the Group has considered sales volumes in the short term, production timeframes, and potential increased costs for its projects. The carrying value of the Group's projects has not been materially impacted during the period due to their long dated nature.",

The share of investment recognised under the equity method is the Group's share of the investment's net assets based on ownership interest held.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are carried at the lower of the equity accounted carrying amount and the recoverable amount. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the equity accounted investment (including assets that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture entity), the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\nDividends from associates and joint ventures represent a return on the Group's investment and, as such, are applied as a reduction to the carrying value of the investment. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are eliminated against the investment in the associate or joint venture to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Other movements in associates' and joint ventures' reserves are recognised directly in the Group's consolidated reserves.\n\n## Development - Investment Property\n\nInvestments in this category hold investment property that is under construction and is subject to periodic revaluations. These revaluations represent development pro/fit earned and are recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Development - Inventory\n\nInvestments in this category contain inventory under development and are held at cost. Revenue is recognised once the inventory settles with the customer and is recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Service Concession Arrangements (SCAs)\n\nThe Group equity accounts its investment in project companies with SCAs through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). These arrangements provide facilities management and maintenance services with terms generally of 25 to 30 years. They also incorporate contractual obligations to make available the individual assets for their prescribed use and, where necessary, overhaul or replace major items of plant and equipment related to the assets with payment obtained through periodic draw downs from the relevant government authorities.\n\n## Joint Operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nInvestments in joint operations are accounted for by recognising amounts on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to the Group's interest in the joint/uni00A0operation.\n\n|                                    | Note   | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Associates                         |        |                |                |\n| Investment in associates           | 12.a   | 713            | 598            |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.a   | -              | -              |\n| Total associates                   |        | 713            | 598            |\n| Joint Ventures                     |        |                |                |\n| Investment in joint ventures       | 12.b   | 4,961          | 3,806          |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.b   | (27)           | (25)           |\n| Total joint ventures               |        | 4,934          | 3,781          |\n| Total equity accounted investments |        | 5,647          | 4,379          |",

Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Under the amortised cost method the di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowing on an e/ffective interest basis. Borrowings are referred to in this section using their redemption value when describing the terms and conditions.",

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are typically classi/fied as treasury shares and are recognised as a deduction from equity.\n\n|                                                                                     | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                     | June 2023                       | June 2023                       | June 2022                       | June 2022                       | June 2023         | June 2023         | June 2022         | June 2022         |\n|                                                                                     | No. of  Shares                  |                                 | No. of  Shares                  |                                 | No. of Units      |                   | No. of Units      |                   |\n|                                                                                     | (m)                             | $m                              | (m)                             | $m                              | (m)               | $m                | (m)               | $m                |\n| Issued capital at beginning  of /financial year, net of  prior period share buyback | 689                             | 1,891                           | 689                             | 1,888                           | 689               | 1,538             | 689               | 1,537             |\n| Distribution Reinvestment  Plan (DRP)                                               | -                               | 3                               | -                               | 3                               | -                 | 1                 | -                 | 1                 |\n| Issued capital at end of  /financial period                                         | 689                             | 1,894                           | 689                             | 1,891                           | 689               | 1,539             | 689               | 1,538             |\n\n## 17.a./uni00A0Issuance of Securities\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, the Group had 689/uni00A0million stapled securities on issue, equivalent to the number of Lendlease Corporation shares and Lendlease Trust (LLT) units on issue as at that date.

        "page_content": "## 17.b./uni00A0Security Accumulation Plans\n\nThe Group's Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was reactivated in February 2011. The last date for receipt of an election notice for participation in the DRP is 22 August 2023. The issue price is the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of Lendlease Group stapled securities traded (on the Australian Securities Exchange) for the period of /five consecutive business days immediately following the record date, commencing on 22 August 2023, for determining entitlements to distribution. If that price is less than 50 cents, the issue price will be 50 cents. Stapled securities issued under the DRP rank equally with all other stapled securities on issue.\n\n## 17.c./uni00A0Terms and Conditions\n\nIssued capital for Lendlease Corporation Limited comprises ordinary shares fully paid. A stapled security represents one share in the Company stapled to one unit in LLT. Stapled securityholders have the right to receive declared dividends from the Company and distributions from LLT and are entitled to one vote per stapled security at securityholders' meetings. Ordinary stapled securityholders rank after all creditors in repayment of capital.\n\nThe Group does not have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued stapled securities.\n\n## 18./uni00A0Capital Management\n\nThe Group assesses capital management as part of its broader strategic plan. The Group focuses on interrelated /financial parameters, including Return on Equity, earnings growth and borrowing capacity. The Group also monitors its gearing ratio, leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and weighted average cost of debt and maturity pro/file. These are all taken into account when the Group makes decisions on how to invest its capital and evaluate its existing investments.\n\nThe Group's capital includes total equity, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. When investing capital, the Group's objective is to deliver strong total securityholder returns and to maintain an investment grade credit rating by maintaining an appropriate /financial pro/file. The Moody's/Fitch long term credit ratings at 30 June 2023 are Baa3/BBB- respectively (June 2022: Baa3/BBB-).\n\nThe capital structure of the Group can be changed by equity issuance, paying distributions to securityholders, the Distribution Reinvestment Plan and changing the level of debt. For further information on how the Group allocates and manages capital, refer to details of the Portfolio Management Framework in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section and Performance and Outlook section of this Annual Report.\n\n## 19./uni00A0Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\nFurther information on liquidity risk is disclosed in Note 24 'Financial Risk Management'. As disclosed in Note 27 'Contingent Liabilities', in certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations including bonding and bank guarantees. Issued bank guarantees have cash collateralisation requirements if the bank guarantee facility is not renewed by the provider.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the Group does not anticipate a signi/ficant liquidity risk in relation to the following /financial liabilities. This is due to the Group's strong /financial pro/file, as supported by the signi/ficant committed undrawn facilities and low gearing ratio. Refer to Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' and Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'.\n\nThe Group has provided collateral of $nil (June 2022: $nil) against letter of credit facilities.",

They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Contract debtors represent receivables where the right to receive payment from customers remains conditional. Other receivables include receivables related to investment management, property development and miscellaneous items.\n\nLoans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts over the term of the loans and receivables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other receivables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as revenue over the remaining term.\n\nThe Group assesses provision for impairment of loans and receivables based on expected loss, and books a provision if material.

Trade and other payables are settled in the normal course of business. Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash out/flows over the term of the trade and other payables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other payables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as an expense over the remaining term.\n\n## Construction Contract Liabilities\n\nConstruction contracts where the total progress billings issued to clients (together with foreseeable losses, if applicable) on a project exceed the revenue recognised (costs incurred to date plus recognised pro/fit) on the contract are recognised as a liability.\n\n## Retentions\n\nRetentions are amounts payable for the purpose of security and for the provision of defects in accordance with contract terms. Release of retention amounts are in accordance with contractual terms.\n\n## Unearned Income\n\nPrimarily relates to unearned income and deposits received in advance on presold apartments. These amounts will be recognised as income in line with the 'Sale of development properties' accounting policy in Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The/uni00A0Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.",

Where a provision is measured using the cash /flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash /flows (when the e/ffect of the time value of money is material).\n\nManagement considers this is an area of estimation uncertainty as these calculations involve a number of key assumptions including the expected future cash out/flow and the timing of the out/flow to determine the provision.\n\n## Employee Bene/fits\n\nIncludes amounts for employee annual leave and long service leave entitlements.\n\n## Development Projects\n\nIncludes amounts for costs to close out development projects, including defects and residual guarantees.

As part of this action, the defect liabilities period has been extended from 6 to 30 years, and there have been updates to building safety regulations for completed residential buildings.\n\nSo as not to be subject to signi/ficant trade restrictions, consistent with other listed UK developers, Lendlease entered into a contract with the UK Government on 22 March 2023, committing to remediate building safety risks consistent with these legislative changes.\n\nLendlease has established a dedicated team undertaking a detailed review into this matter, however timing and access to information is limited. Lendlease believes that the liability currently relates to 59 buildings, of which 58 were developed by Crosby, a company that Lendlease acquired in 2005 to enter the residential development market in the UK. Notably, many of these buildings were completed or had commenced construction prior to Lendlease's acquisition. Lendlease no longer owns any of these buildings.\n\nIt is noted that each building completed by a Lendlease entity was certi/fied as complying with applicable building regulations at the time of its completion.\n\nThe government department responsible for this legislation has provided a schedule listing buildings in the portfolio and, in some cases, their assessment or estimate of the cost to remediate. Furthermore, Lendlease has now been in initial contact with some of the building owners to gather more information on the cost of remediation. This information is currently under evaluation and has been used to extrapolate across the rest of the portfolio to estimate the required provision.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Lendlease recognised a provision in respect of this matter of $200/uni00A0million (pre-tax), as a gross amount. At 30 June 2023 an additional provision of $95/uni00A0million (pre-tax) has been recognised to account for market cost increases and updated information received in respect of the portfolio. The cash expenditure by Lendlease is expected to be spread over a period of at least",

This expense has been excluded from Core Operating Pro/fit given it is a consequence of retrospective government action, which could not reasonably have been expected from normal operations.\n\nWe have included in the provision amounts for buildings where we have cost estimates provided by third parties or building owners. There are a number of buildings for which we do not have documentation and are not able to establish whether remediation work is required. Given we are at the early stages of this process, there are both risks and opportunities to the provision that has been estimated. Key risks include the addition of new buildings or new information in relation to already identi/fied buildings, as well as the rising costs in the local market. Key opportunities include the potential for bulk procurement, re-interrogating scope on tender pricing, and assessing various options in the delivery model. Further, this provision does not include anticipated recoveries from third parties, including insurances and supply chain. Lendlease is actively working to maximise third party recoveries however expects this process will be over an extended period of time.\n\nDetermining the liability position for this matter and any estimate is a complex process requiring signi/ficant judgement with respect to whether there is an obligating event and the quantum of any liability. The estimate of any potential liability is based on incomplete information and will be updated as work and time progresses. Lendlease will continue to engage with building owners and the UK Government on these industry wide actions and assess additional relevant information on an ongoing basis.",

A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the Group's equity and Pro/fit after tax by $2/uni00A0million (June 2022: $6/uni00A0million decrease in the Group's equity and Pro/fit after tax). The increase or decrease in interest income/(expense) is proportional to the increase or decrease in interest rates. Interest rate derivatives have been included in this calculation.\n\n## 25./uni00A0Hedging\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group uses derivative /financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, /financing and investing activities. Derivative /financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Hedge accounting recognises the o/ffsetting e/ffects on pro/fit or loss of changes in the fair value of the derivative /financial instruments and the hedged item. The accounting for hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are classi/fied as either fair value hedges, cash /flow hedges or investment hedges.\n\nThe Group has minimal hedges designated at fair value. The Group primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts as cash /flow hedges for highly probable sale, purchase and dividend transactions. The Group also uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge cross border intercompany loans and transactions which mainly net o/ff in the Income Statement. Interest rate swaps and interest rate options are used to manage the Group's exposure to interest rates arising from borrowings. These are primarily treated as cash /flow hedges and are mainly on borrowings within equity accounted investments.\n\nThe Group has foreign exchange derivative contracts primarily held in GBP, USD, EUR, SGD and CNY at reporting date to hedge speci/fic foreign currency exposures. The total gross payable exposure is $1,595/uni00A0million (June 2022: payable $1,663/uni00A0million).\n\nThere are 12 foreign currency contracts that will mature in more than one year (June 2022: 31 foreign currency contracts).",

While this represents the best estimation of fair value at the reporting date, the fair values may di/ffer if there is volatility in market prices or foreign exchange rates in future periods.\n\nAll /financial instruments recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, including those instruments carried at amortised cost, are recognised at amounts that represent a reasonable approximation of fair value, with the exception of the following borrowings:\n\n|                  |      | JUNE 2023          | JUNE 2023     | JUNE 2022          | JUNE 2022     |\n|------------------|------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|\n|                  | Note | Carrying Amount $m | Fair Value $m | Carrying Amount $m | Fair Value $m |\n| Liabilities      |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Current          |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Commercial notes | 16.a | -                  | -             | -                  | -             |\n| Non Current      |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Commercial notes | 16.a | 1,928              | 1,780         | 2,082              | 1,996         |\n\nThe fair value of commercial notes has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash /flows by the appropriate government bond rates and credit margin applicable to the relevant term of the commercial note.\n\n## 26.a./uni00A0Basis of Determining Fair Value\n\nThe determination of fair values of /financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of unlisted equity investments, including investments in property funds, is determined based on an assessment of the underlying net assets, which may include periodic independent and Directors' valuations, future maintainable earnings and any special circumstances pertaining to the particular investment. Fair value of unlisted equity investments has also taken the economic conditions into consideration to determine fair value at 30 June 2023. This included valuations of underlying investment properties at balance date\n- \u00b7 The fair values of other /financial assets and /financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques; these include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other assets that are substantially the same, and discounted cash /flow analysis\n- \u00b7 The fair value of derivative instruments comprises forward foreign exchange contracts, which are valued using forward rates at balance date, and interest rate swap contracts, which are measured at the present value of future cash /flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and include consideration of counterparty risk adjustments.\n\n## 26.b./uni00A0Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe di/fferent levels for valuation method have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: The fair value is determined using the unadjusted quoted price for an identical asset or liability in an active market for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7 Level 2: The fair value is calculated using predominantly observable market data other than unadjusted quoted prices for an identical asset or liability\n- \u00b7 Level 3: The fair value is calculated using inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\nDuring the /financial year, there were no material transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value hierarchies.",

Such claims and exposures largely arise in respect of claims for defects (including under both contract and legislation), claims for breach of performance obligations or breach of warranty or claims under indemnities. In some claims:\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a legal obligation exists;\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a future cash out/flow will arise in respect to these items; and/or\n- - It is not possible to quantify the potential exposure with su/fficient reliability.\n\nThis particularly applies in larger more complex projects, in claims involving a number of parties or in claims made a number of years after completion of a project.\n\nWhere it is probable there will be liabilities from such claims and the potential exposure can be quanti/fied with su/fficient reliability, a provision has been made for anticipated losses arising from such claims.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations. This includes bonding and bank guarantee facilities used primarily by the Construction business as well as performance guarantees for certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Securities Class Action\n\nLendlease Corporation Limited and Lendlease Responsible Entity Limited (together the Lendlease Group) were served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 18 April 2019 by David William Pallas and Julie Ann Pallas as trustees for the Pallas Family Superannuation Fund, represented by Maurice Blackburn. On 7 August 2019, Lendlease Group was served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 August 2019 by Martin John Fletcher, represented by Phi Finney McDonald. On 21 November 2019 the Supreme Court ordered consolidation of the two class actions into a single proceeding. The consolidated proceeding alleges that Lendlease was in breach of its continuous disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 and made representations about its Engineering and Services business that were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on Lendlease Group. Lendlease Group denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this proceeding.",

The disclosures detail the types of entities and transactions included in the consolidation and those excluded.\n\n## 28./uni00A0Consolidated Entities\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group consolidation comprises all subsidiaries controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 Has the power to direct the relevant activities such as key operating, /financial and investing decisions\n- \u00b7 Has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee such as dividends, loans and fees\n- \u00b7 Has the ability to use its power over the investee to a/ffect the amount of returns.\n\nIn assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Management uses accounting judgement in determining whether the Group controls an entity by applying the above control criteria and reviewing the substance of its relationship with the entity.\n\nThe /financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The /financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies with adjustments made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.\n\nExternal non controlling interests are allocated their share of total comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position, separately from the equity of securityholders.\n\nThe material consolidated entities of the Group listed below were wholly owned during the current and prior year.

These vehicles, while not legally controlled, are currently required to be consolidated for accounting purposes.\n\n## 29.a./uni00A0Employee Security Plans\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, employees own approximately 0.9 per cent (June 2022: 0.9 per cent) of the issued capital of the Group through various active Lendlease employee security plans and ownership vehicles, details of which are outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Australia: Employee Share Acquisition Plan (ESAP): ESAP was established in December 1988 for the purpose of employees acquiring securities in the Group and is funded by Lendlease subscriptions, and employee salary sacri/fice contributions\n- \u00b7 Americas: US Rabbi Trust (Rabbi Trust) was established in 2004 and updated in 2005 for the acceptance of employee pro/fit share contributions used to acquire Group securities for US based employees. This part of the plan is not currently accepting new contributions\n- \u00b7 Employee Share Acquisition Plan (STI) (ESAP STI): ESAP STI was established in July 2014 for the purpose of acquiring and allocating securities granted as the deferred component of Short Term Incentive (STI) awards, which are funded by Lendlease subscriptions. Securities are currently allocated to employees across Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe eligibility rules for each plan are determined by reference to the regulatory, legal and tax rules of each country in which the Group operates.\n\n## Distributions and/or Voting Rights\n\nGenerally, employees in the various operating security plans are entitled to distributions and voting rights for allocated securities. The plans re/flect this intention subject to regulatory, legal and tax constraints. The trustee may exercise these rights in accordance with any /fiduciary or governance rules pertaining to the deed or trust laws in the legal and tax jurisdiction within which the trust operates.\n\n## 29.b./uni00A0Employee Security Ownership Vehicles\n\nIn addition to the plans discussed above, Lendlease has an employee security ownership vehicle, Lendlease Retirement Bene/fit Fund (RBF):\n\n- \u00b7 RBF was established in 1984 with shareholder approval for the bene/fit of employees. RBF holds Lendlease securities. The Lendlease securities in RBF are not available for allocation to employees other than in the event of a change of control of the Group and, in accordance with RBF's trust deed, the capital of the trust is not available to the Group. The RBF trustee has discretion as to the distribution of the RBF funds. In 1992, a deed poll was executed which allows for the distribution of the income of RBF to the Company to fund employee bene/fit activities through the Lendlease Foundation. As a result of changes to the constitution and governance structure of the RBF trustee on 22/uni00A0June 2017, Lendlease currently does not have control of RBF and therefore RBF is currently not required to be consolidated for accounting purposes\n- \u00b7 The RBF arrangement is subject to periodic review to assess its ongoing role and operation.",

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) (or groups of CGUs) that are expected to bene/fit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. CGUs are an identi/fiable group of assets that generate cash associated with the goodwill. Management considers this is an area of estimation uncertainty as these calculations involve an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. The Construction CGUs use the value in use basis, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash /flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the recoverable amounts.\n\nManagement agreements and other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (see Note 7 'Other Expenses'). Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, ranging from three to 20 years.\n\n|                         | Note   | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|-------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Goodwill                | 32.a   | 1,085          | 1,056          |\n| Management agreements   |        | 16             | 24             |\n| Other intangibles       |        | 135            | 145            |\n| Total intangible assets |        | 1,236          | 1,225          |\n\n## 32.a./uni00A0Goodwill\n\n|                                                                                       | Note   | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Development                                                                           |        | 34             | 33             |\n| Construction                                                                          |        | 1,051          | 1,023          |\n| Total goodwill                                                                        |        | 1,085          | 1,056          |\n| Reconciliations of the carrying amounts for each category of goodwill are as follows: |        |                |                |\n| Development                                                                           |        |                |                |\n| Carrying amount at beginning of /financial year                                       |        | 33             | 30             |\n| E/ffect of foreign exchange rate movements                                            |        | 1              | 3              |\n| Carrying amount at end of /financial year                                             |        | 34             | 33             |\n| Construction                                                                          |        |                |                |\n| Carrying amount at beginning of /financial year                                       |        | 1,023          | 1,170          |\n| Disposals                                                                             |        | -              | (151)          |\n| E/ffect of foreign exchange rate/other movements                                      |        | 28             | 4              |\n| Carrying amount at end of /financial year                                             | 32.b   | 1,051          | 1,023          |",

For the Construction CGUs, the assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of each CGU are based on past experience and expectations for the future, utilising both internal and external sources of data and relevant industry trends.\n\nNo impairment arose as a result of the review of goodwill for the Construction CGUs for the /financial year ended 30 June 2023. Based on information available and market conditions at 30 June 2023, a reasonably foreseeable change in the assumptions made in this assessment would not result in impairment of Construction goodwill. The foreseeable change in the assumptions took the economic conditions into consideration.\n\nThe following describes the key assumptions on which management has based its cash /flow projections when determining VIU relating to the Construction CGUs:\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nThe VIU calculations use pre tax cash /flow projections based on actual operating results, and /financial forecasts covering a /five year period which have been approved by management. These forecasts are based on management estimates to determine income, expenses, capital expenditure and cash /flows for each CGU.\n\n## Growth Rate\n\nThe terminal value growth rate used to extrapolate the cash /flows beyond the /five year period is 3.0 per cent (June 2022: 3.0 per cent). The growth rate re/flects the forecast long term average growth rate for each CGU and the countries in which they operate.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rates applied to the cash /flow projections vary between 10.3 per cent and 12.0 per cent (June 2022: between 9.2 per cent and 11.0 per cent). The Group's weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point for determining the discount rate, with appropriate adjustments for the risk pro/file relating to the relevant CGUs and the countries in which they operate. The discount rates used are pre tax.\n\n## 33./uni00A0Discontinued Operations\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nDiscontinued operations relate to a component of the Group including its corresponding assets and liabilities that have been classi/fied as held for sale and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation.\n\nA Disposal Group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Where fair value is lower than the carrying amount, the di/fference is recognised as an impairment loss within the Income Statement. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Management at that time committed to a plan to exit from Non core operations of Engineering and Services.\n\nOn 19 December 2019, the Group entered into an agreement with Acciona to sell its Engineering business and on 9 September 2020 the Group completed the sale.\n\nOn 21 July 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with Service Stream to sell the Services business and on 1 November 2021 the Group completed the sale. The agreed purchase price for the sale of the Services business was $310/uni00A0million which was adjusted by $19/uni00A0million at completion, resulting in total estimated proceeds of $329/uni00A0million. $317/uni00A0million has been received by 31 December 2022, and the remaining balance was received in January 2023.\n\nProvisions previously recognised in relation to the sold Engineering business have been revised in the current year to include the associated tax bene/fit. There is no impact to total pro/fit after tax.\n\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities sold are as follows:\n\n|                                  | SERVICES 1 November  2021   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Assets and Liabilities Sold      | $m                          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 3                           |\n| Loans and receivables            | 84                          |\n| Inventories                      | 145                         |\n| Other assets                     | 276                         |\n| Total assets sold                | 508                         |\n| Trade and other payables         | 121                         |\n| Other liabilities                | 97                          |\n| Total liabilities sold           | 218                         |\n| Net assets and liabilities sold  | 290                         |\n| Net proceeds from sale           | 331                         |\n| Transaction and separation costs | (25)                        |\n| Gain on sale                     | 16                          |\n\nThe results of the discontinued operations representing the Engineering business during the current year and the Services business for the prior period are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                          | ENGINEERING June 2023   | SERVICES 1 July to 1 November  2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Results from Discontinued Operations                                                     | $m                      | $m                                    |\n| Revenue from contracts with customers                                                    | -                       | 351                                   |\n| Cost of sales                                                                            | -                       | (320)                                 |\n| Gross pro/fit                                                                            | -                       | 31                                    |\n| Other income                                                                             | -                       | -                                     |\n| Gain on sale                                                                             | -                       | 16                                    |\n| Other expenses                                                                           | (76)                    | (19)                                  |\n| (Loss)/Pro/fit before tax for discontinued operations                                    | (76)                    | 28                                    |\n| Income tax bene/fit/(expense)                                                            | 76                      | (1)                                   |\n| Total pro/fit after tax for discontinued operations as presented in the Income Statement | -                       | 27                                    |",

The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee administered funds as determined by periodic actuarial calculations.\n\nA de/fined bene/fit plan is a pension plan that de/fines the amount of pension bene/fit an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe asset or liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of de/fined bene/fit plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation i.e. 'the pension liability' at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the pension liability is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out/flows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid\n- \u00b7 Have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit obligation is calculated at least annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which in simplistic terms proportions the bene/fit based on service. Management considers the valuation of de/fined bene/fit plans undertaken by the actuaries to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a number of key assumptions must be adopted to determine the valuation.\n\nActuarial losses/(gains) will arise where there is a di/fference between previous estimates and actual experience, or a change to assumptions in relation to demographic and /financial trends. These actuarial losses/(gains) are recognised in the period they occur, directly in other comprehensive income as remeasurements. They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPast service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                        | Note   | June 2023 $m   | June 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Lendlease Superannuation Plan          |        | -              | -              |\n| Lendlease UK Pension Scheme            | 34.a   | 171            | 282            |\n| Total net de/fined bene/fit plan asset |        | 171            | 282            |\n\n## 34.a./uni00A0Lendlease UK Pension Scheme\n\nLendlease Construction Holdings (Europe) Limited (UK Construction) sponsors a funded de/fined bene/fit pension scheme (the Scheme) for qualifying UK employees. The Scheme is administered by a separate board of Trustees which is legally separate from UK Construction. The Scheme's Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant bene/ficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the bene/fits.\n\nThe Scheme is a funded de/fined bene/fit scheme, with the /final salary section providing retirement bene/fits based on /final salary and the index linked section providing retirement bene/fits based on career average salary. A separate section, the Personal Investment Section, provides retirement bene/fits on a de/fined contribution basis. The UK Construction's contributions to members' Personal Investment Fund accounts are not included in these disclosures.\n\nThe /final salary section closed to future accruals on 31 August 2008 and the index linked section closed to future accruals on 31 January 2012. There were no Scheme amendments a/ffecting de/fined bene/fits payable, curtailments or settlements during the year./uni00A0UK Construction pays four per cent of members' basic salaries to cover the Scheme's expected administration costs and costs of bene/fits payable on death in service. Following the triennial valuation for 31 March 2020, de/ficit repair contributions are not required to be paid as the scheme is in an actuarial surplus.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plan is exposed to actuarial risk and market (investment) risk.

The plan assets can be categorised as Level 1, where the fair value is determined using an unadjusted quoted price for an identical asset, or Level 2, where the fair value is derived either directly or indirectly from observable inputs, or Level 3, where inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable). At year end, $966/uni00A0million (June 2022: $1,077/uni00A0million) and $nil (June 2022: $107/uni00A0million) of total plan assets were categorised as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. UK Construction and Trustees have agreed to a long term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets that perform in line with the liabilities of the plan so as to protect against in/flation being higher than expected. The current targeted benchmark allocation is 22.5 per cent growth assets and 77.5 per cent matching assets (June 2022: 22.5 per cent growth assets and 77.5 per cent matching assets).\n\n|                                          | June 2023   | June 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| vi.

If assets underperform this yield, this will create a/uni00A0de/ficit.\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yield will increase the value placed on the Scheme's liabilities, although this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of the Scheme's corporate bond holdings. The majority of the Scheme's bene/fit obligations are linked to in/flation and higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most cases this will be capped to protect against extreme in/flation. The majority of the assets are either una/ffected by or loosely correlated with in/flation, meaning that an increase in in/flation will also increase the de/ficit. The majority of the Scheme's obligations are to provide bene/fits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for expected future mortality improvements. The assumption is that a member aged 63 will live for a further 25.5 years (June 2022: 25.3 years) if they are male and 26.8 years if they are female (June 2022: 26.8 years).\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the weighted average duration of the de/fined bene/fit obligation was 14 years (June 2022: 16 years).\n\n## vii.

Once in payment, pension increases are linked to RPI but with a zero per cent /floor and di/fferent caps applying to di/fferent periods of pensionable service. The in/flation sensitivity re/flects a change in RPI in/flation and the associated increases in payment.\n\n## 35./uni00A0Employee Bene/fits\n\nDetailed information regarding the Group's Executive Reward strategy is provided in the Remuneration Report within the Directors' Report. The key incentive plans are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short Term Incentive (STI)\n- \u00b7 Short Term Award (STA)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Award (LTA)\n- \u00b7 Restricted Securities Award (RSA)\n- \u00b7 Pro Rata CEO Grant\n- \u00b7 Google Development Ventures (GDV) Incentive.\n\n## 35.a./uni00A0Short Term Incentive (STI)\n\nThe STI plan is an annual incentive plan whereby a number of employees receive bene/fits which are dependent upon the achievement of both Lendlease /financial and non /financial targets, and individual goals. The total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is tested against relevant market levels for each role.\n\n- \u00b7 The STI plan typically comprises a cash component, which is paid in September following year end. For more senior employees, where the potential bene/fit is typically higher, the plan also includes a deferred component\n- \u00b7 Deferral periods are generally for one or two years. The deferred component is normally awarded as Lendlease securities and in some instances as cash. Securities are held in Lendlease employee security plan trusts on behalf of employees for the deferral period (refer to Note 29a 'Employee Security Plans'). For employees to receive the deferred component in full, they must generally be employed by the Group at the time of vesting.",

It is designed to focus senior executives on priority areas for delivery in the current /financial year, including key Group and regional /financial targets, safety and other non /financial targets aligned to the Group's areas of focus.\n\nWhilst performance is assessed against a set of Group metrics when determining awards, the Board will assess the overall performance and contribution of individual senior executives, with a particular focus on safety.\n\nThe total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is set with reference to both internal peers and external market levels. For FY20 and FY21, the STA plan has been awarded as cash in September following year end. From FY22 onwards, 50 per cent of awarded STA will be a deferred grant of Lendlease securities. The deferred portion will be released in two equal tranches after one and two years.\n\n## 35.c./uni00A0Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n\nThe LTI plan is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Motivate executives to achieve the Group's long term strategic goals and provide reward where the Group delivers better value to securityholders than its peers\n- \u00b7 Align the interests of executives and securityholders, given that the reward received is linked to the Group's security price and average Return on Equity performance.\n\n## Arrangements for LTI Awards\n\n| LTI Design

The RSA (and previously referred to LTA Minimum) was discontinued from FY22 under the revised Executive Reward Strategy.\n\n## Arrangements for RSA Awards\n\n| RSA Design         | How the RSA Works                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance Rights | \u00b7 An annual grant of 'performance rights' is made to a limited number of executives on the Global  Leadership Team                                                                                                                   |\n|                    | \u00b7 However, following feedback from proxy-holders and other stakeholders, the RSA has no longer been o/ffered  from/uni00A0FY22                                                                                                       |\n|                    | \u00b7 The Board intends that the awards be settled in Lendlease securities, although some or all of the award may  be settled in cash at the Board's discretion                                                                          |\n|                    | \u00b7 Performance rights are rights to receive one Lendlease stapled security, or at the Board's discretion, cash or  other instruments of equivalent value                                                                              |\n|                    | \u00b7 In the event of a change in control of the Group, the Board has the discretion to determine whether the  vesting of some or all performance rights should be accelerated.                                                          |\n|                    | Vesting Period \u00b7 The /first tranche (i.e. 25%) will vest after three years and the second, third and fourth tranches will vest  progressively four, /five and six years after the grant date.                                        |\n|                    | Termination  of Employment \u00b7 If the executive resigns and becomes engaged in activities that are competitive with the Group or is  terminated for cause, the unvested RSA is forfeited                                               |\n|                    | \u00b7 If the executive is terminated and if the Board considers vesting would provide a bene/fit that was  unwarranted or inappropriate, the Board has the discretion to lapse some or all performance rights prior  to the vesting date |\n|                    | \u00b7 For 'good leavers', the RSA grant may remain on foot, subject to the original terms.                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## 35.f./uni00A0Pro Rata CEO Grant\n\nThe pro rata CEO Grant is designed to recognise the period served as Global CEO (one month) in FY21 for Anthony Lombardo.",

The model inputs include the Lendlease Group security price, a risk free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield.

The Group contracts in a variety of ways. Each project has a different risk profile based on its individual contractual and delivery characteristics.\n\nCurrently, global market conditions are uncertain with disruption to supply chains and inflationary pressures. These conditions continue to create a challenging operating environment impacting productivity, expected timing of completion and expected costs to complete.\n\nConstruction revenue recognition is a key audit matter as judgement is required to assess the timing of recognition determined by the Group. Revenue on construction contracts is earned over time, typically using costs incurred as a proportion of total forecast costs as the measure of progress.\n\nEstimating total forecast costs to complete during project life is complex and requires judgement. Typical cost estimates include labour, subcontractors, equipment, materials, and project overheads. Changes to these cost estimates could give rise to variances in the amount of revenue recognized.\n\nThe revenue on construction contracts may also include variations and claims, which fall under either the variable consideration or contract modification requirements of AASB 15. These\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and testing the Group's review and approval of revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of contracts for testing using:\n- -Data Analytic routines based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, related to size and risk of projects; and\n- -the Group's project reporting tool.\n- \u00b7 For the sample selected, we:\n- -conducted visits to a selection of project sites to evidence physical progress;\n- -inquired with key project personnel to assess the project schedule, forecast costs, risks and opportunities, with involvement from KPMG engineering specialists where appropriate;\n- -read relevant contract terms and conditions to evaluate the inclusion of individual characteristics and project risks in the Group's estimates;\n- -tested a sample of incurred costs to supplier invoices or other underlying documentation;\n- -tested forecast costs for labour, subcontractors, equipment, materials, and project overheads by comparing to actual incurred spend, committed future contracts and current market quotes, with specific consideration of inflation in our assessment of contingency;\n- -tested the variations and claims recognised within revenue against the criteria for",

It is the Group's policy for development revenue to be recognised when control transfers to the purchaser, based on an assessment of the contractual terms of sale.\n\nThis was a key audit matter due to the volume of transactions that occur across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the assessment of cost of sales includes judgement as cost allocation for site infrastructure costs is typically based on the proportion of revenue for each unit, lot or building as compared to total forecast project revenue.\n\nThe assessment of profit recognition requires judgment as cost allocation is typically a function of total forecast project profit based on either revenue or area estimation.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and testing the Group's review and approval of development revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of settlements, across multiple jurisdictions, during the year. For the sample selected we:\n- -compared revenue recognised to contractual terms of sale and cash settlements;\n- -assessed the Group's determination of when control transfers by a detailed analysis of the contractual terms of sale against the criteria in the accounting standards;\n- -assessed the Group's cost allocation methodology against the requirements of the accounting standards;\n- -tested the application of the cost allocation methodology by comparing allocated costs to revenue recognised in the year relative to the total project revenue; and\n- -assessed total project revenue by comparing expected sales prices to published industry forecasts and comparable sales prices achieved in the year, being alert to the impacts of current challenging market conditions.",

Development costs include the purchase of land, site infrastructure costs, construction costs for built form products and borrowing costs.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to carry inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The recoverability therefore of these capitalised development costs is a significant judgement made by the Group, and their assessment is based on forecasts of:\n\n- \u00b7 sales prices; and\n- \u00b7 construction and infrastructure costs to complete the development.\n\nWhere a development is forecast to be loss making and the inventory is no longer considered to be recoverable, the Group considers it to be impaired and it is their policy for an expense to be recognised.\n\nThis was a key audit matter for us due to many developments being long term which increases the level of forecasting judgement and audit complexity in assessing estimated sales prices and future costs to complete the development.

Within these investments are a significant number of investment properties measured at fair value. These properties include commercial, retail, industrial, life sciences and residential (build to rent) assets. The fair value of these properties directly impacts the Group's interests in its equity accounted investments and other financial assets.\n\nValuations of assets are generally performed by the Group using internal valuation methodologies (discounted cash flow or capitalised income approach) or through the use of external valuation experts. External valuations are obtained on a routine basis by the Group each year, with the remaining investments being valued internally.\n\nThe Group's key valuation assumptions are predominantly:\n\n- \u00b7 capitalisation of earnings rates\n- \u00b7 market rent\n- \u00b7 leasing incentives\n- \u00b7 discount rates\n- \u00b7 rental growth rates\n\nGiven the current market conditions real estate valuations have been subject to fluctuation. The assessment of the valuations of these assets is a key audit matter as they:\n\n- \u00b7 contain certain forward-looking assumptions, with higher estimation uncertainty given current economic conditions, which are inherently challenging to audit; and\n- \u00b7 lead to additional audit effort, often due to the high number of differing assumptions and models, across varying asset classes.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of valuations performed by the Group, based on the significance of the asset to the Group's financial position and performance;\n- \u00b7 For the sample selected:\n- -Worked with our real estate valuation specialists, we compare key assumptions with market data published by commercial real estate agents, previous external valuations, our knowledge of the industry, and/or our knowledge of the asset and its historical performance. Key assumptions include:\n- o capitalisation of earnings rates\n- o market rent\n- o leasing incentives\n- o discount rates\n- o rental growth rates\n- -Assessed the scope, competence and objectivity of external valuation experts engaged by the Group for assets valued by external valuation experts;\n- -Assessed the valuation methodology for consistency with accounting standards and industry practice for the asset's class; and\n- -Evaluated and tested the Group's review and approval of internal valuations based on the Group's policies for internally valued assets;\n- \u00b7 Assessing disclosures included in the financial report highlighting the estimates and judgements in determining fair values of the Group's equity accounted investments and other financial assets.

Since then, the UK Government has introduced the Building Safety Act which requires developers to remediate fire-safety issues on all buildings of 11 metres and above.\n\nIn March 2023, the Group signed the UK Government's Developer Remediation Contract, requiring the Group to remediate buildings which they developed within the last 30 years where there are life critical fire-safety issues identified.\n\nEstimation of the provision requires identification of which buildings will , more likely than not, require remediation based on information currently available. The Group's assessment process is ongoing as information continues to be obtained from a range of parties in respect of each building. A full intrusive building inspection against the required safety standards will determine whether remediation is required or not. However, these assessments take time to complete resulting in the Group using judgement to determine whether a provision is required for each building before the formal inspection process is complete.\n\nThe estimate also requires an assessment of the likely cost and timing of these future works. This was a key audit matter for us due to the high degree of estimation uncertainty and subjectivity in determining the likely cost of future works. The key assumptions giving rise to this estimation uncertainty are:\n\n- \u00b7 the number of buildings requiring remediation;\n- \u00b7 remediation cost per building;\n- \u00b7 expected period over which the portfolio of buildings will be remediated; and\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of the discount rate applied to the estimate.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing a walkthrough to understand the Group's process for identifying which buildings, will more likely than not, require remediation based on the information available.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the completeness of buildings included in the Group's assessment with reference to publicly available information on buildings developed by the Group.\n- \u00b7 For each building identified by the Group, assessing the recognition of a provision with reference to information provided by the UK Government (Building Safety Fund), building owners and the Group's internal investigations.\n- \u00b7 Working with our major projects advisory specialists, we compared the methodology applied and key assumptions selected by the Group in developing the estimate with our knowledge of the industry. We challenged key assumptions by:\n- -Inspecting individual building information from the UK Government (Building Safety Fund) and building owners compared to the provision recognised along with obtaining evidence for any adjustments;\n- -Benchmarking the cost of remediation of the Group's portfolio of buildings based on size and number of apartments, as well as comparing individual building costs where there are multiple buildings in the same development; and\n- -Benchmarking the discount rate and period of remediation adopted by the Group to other developers within the industry.\n- \u00b7 Assessing disclosures included in the financial report highlighting the estimates and judgements in determining the provision.

This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate Lendlease Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objective is:\n\n- \u00b7 to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- \u00b7 to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.",

        "page_content": "## Securityholder information\n\n## Securities exchange listing and code\n\nLendlease Group is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and trades under the code LLC.\n\nIn the United States, Lendlease securities are traded on the 'over the counter' market in the form of sponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) under the symbol LLESY. Each ADR represents one ordinary security. Information about ADRs is available from the depositary, The Bank of New York Mellon www.adrbny.com\n\n## Voting rights\n\nEach stapled security in Lendlease Group and each ADR entitles the holder to one vote. Rights to Lendlease Group securities granted under Lendlease Group's employee equity incentive plans do not carry voting rights.\n\n## Share Accumulation Plan\n\nThe Share Accumulation Plan is designed to be a convenient way for securityholders with a registered address in Australia or New Zealand to build their securityholdings without incurring transaction costs. The laws of other countries make it di/fficult for us to o/ffer securities in this way. Lendlease securityholders are able to reinvest their distributions to acquire more Lendlease securities through the Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) or the Share Election Plan (SEP). Securityholders may also make contributions of between $500 and $2,500 to acquire new Lendlease securities under the Share Purchase Plan (SPP). Together the DRP, SEP and SPP constitute the Share Accumulation Plan.\n\nThe rules of each of these plans are set out in the Share Accumulation Plan Information Sheet. Copies are available on the Lendlease website. Please note that the Share Election Plan and the Share Purchase Plan are currently suspended.\n\n## Key sources of information for securityholders\n\nWe report the following to securityholders each year:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Report\n- \u00b7 Half Year Financial Report\n- \u00b7 March and September distribution statements.\n\n## Electronic communications\n\nSecurityholders have the option of receiving the following communications and all other Company related information electronically:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Report\n- \u00b7 Distribution statements\n- \u00b7 Notice of Annual General Meetings.\n\nLendlease makes the Annual Report available in an online version. A hard copy of the Annual Report will only be sent to those securityholders who elect to receive it in that form. In addition, securityholders may elect to receive noti/fication when the Annual Report is available online.\n\nSecurityholders who wish to register their email address should go to the website of the Lendlease share registry www.investorcentre.com/ecomms\n\nFor registry contact details, see page 178.\n\n## Privacy legislation\n\nUnder Chapter 2C of the Corporations Act 2001, a securityholder's information (including their name, address and details of securities held) is required to be included in Lendlease's public register. This information must continue to be included in Lendlease's public register for seven years after a person ceases to be a securityholder. These statutory obligations are not altered by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000. Information is collected to administer the securityholder's holding and if some or all of the information is not collected, then it may not be possible to administer the holding. Lendlease's privacy policy is available on its website.\n\n## Dispute resolution\n\nThere is a dispute resolution mechanism that covers complaints by securityholders. For more information, please contact Lendlease Investor Relations at +61 2 9236 6111 or email us investorrelations@lendlease.com\n\n## Distribution and Share Accumulation Plan issue price history\n\nFor historical distribution and Share Accumulation Plan Issue Price information, please see the below link to our website www.lendlease.com/au/ investor-centre/distribution-and-tax",
