Conferring a competitive advantage during uncertain times, as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, decentralization renders company operations more flexible, efficient and effective. Based on each affiliate's operational autonomy and the overall strategic principles defined at Group level, it is defined by the constant interaction between headquarters, Brand Companies and Market Companies.\n\n## A unique portfolio of premium brands\n\nPernod Ricard has one of the most comprehensive portfolios of premium brands on the market, encompassing every major category of wine and spirits and providing the Group with a clear competitive advantage. Constantly evolving thanks to a dynamic management policy driven by brand acquisitions or disposals, this portfolio allows Pernod Ricard to always be aligned with new consumer trends while investing in the most promising segments and brands.\n\n- (a) Source: 'The Pernod Ricard Market View', based on IWSR volume data at end 2021.\n- (b) 1% not being considered a difference by external service providers.\n- (c) Reduction per unit of production between FY18 and FY22.\n- (d) Reduction of production sites (Scopes 1 and 2) in absolute value between FY10 and FY22.\n- (e) Headcount at 30 June 2022.\n- (f) Source: 'The Pernod Ricard Market View', based on IWSR volume data at end 2021.

Simple, authentic moments of sharing, laughing and connecting. The pleasure of raising a glass together and toasting to new memories.\n\nNow, more than ever, we understand just how important these moments are. We know what it feels like to be without them. I strongly believe that if there is one positive outcome from the Covid-19 years it is that we have rediscovered the importance of filling our lives with real human connection for our own health and well-being. For five decades now Pernod Ricard has been championing this universal need. As 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9,' these moments of collective camaraderie are at the very heart of what we do. Convivialit\u00e9 transcends our di/ff  erences - be they physical, cultural, ethnic\n\nor generational - and is open to everyone. This is our company vision, our purpose, our drive, and it's what sets us apart from the rest.\n\n## Staying true to our culture and shared values\n\nOur teams have once again shown that our greatest assets are our people who, together, year on year, continue to go the extra mile in delivering sustainable growth with tangible, positive impact. I'm immensely proud and fortunate to be able to call them my colleagues.\n\nOur purpose as a Group is to do more than just sell the finest wines and spirits. As true convivialists, we are moved by a common purpose to transform every moment, every coming together, into a meaningful and convivial experience. We unlock the magic\n\n'Our greatest assets are our people.'\n\nof human connection by bringing Good Times from a Good Place in meaningful, positive and responsible ways. This is our North Star, our guiding light, and I don't ever want us to lose sight of it.\n\nAn exciting transformational journey\n\nOur transformational journey started back in 2015, when we focused on our collective mindset to grow our business. With the launch of Transform & Accelerate in 2018, we concentrated on enhancing our profitable growth with an emphasis on e/ff.short iciency and e/ff ectiveness. Our convivial culture is now complemented by a heightened performance-driven focus built on our five cultural imperatives of Health, Safety & Wellbeing, Sustainability &\n\n1.",

This means challenging ourselves to capture future growth opportunities and leading the way in thought and action to transform every moment into a convivial experience.\n\nThis was precisely our goal when we unveiled our enhanced growth engine, The Conviviality Platform, which leverages digital media and data to expand and accelerate our business, and thus bring our purpose to life. This is what I like to call precision at scale.\n\nFor us, the end goal is not simply to leverage data; it is to spread convivialit\u00e9 by leveraging data and artificial intelligence. Together with our diverse portfolio of amazing brands and our unparalleled distribution network, The Conviviality Platform will enable us to o/ff er the right product, at the right price, at the right time, to the right consumer, with the right experience for every occasion and in every market.\n\n## Sustainability at the core of our business\n\nExactly 90 years ago, in the middle of the Great Depression, my grandfather founded one of the brands that gave birth to this Group. His bold spirit and sense of responsibility led him, years later, to also create the Paul Ricard Oceanographic Institute to help protect our oceans, one of his great passions. To this day, this commitment and sense of guardianship is stronger than ever, having woven sustainable and responsible thinking into the fabric of who we are and\n\nwhat we do. It is not only the right thing to do for our planet, but it's the legacy we want to leave. Sustainability is vital for the resilience of our business, critical to attracting the very best people and decisive for shaping the future of our industry.\n\nOur Sustainability & Responsibility roadmap is on track to meet or even outperform the ambitious targets we set for ourselves. This year we became the first company to support the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Agriculture and Land Health Initiative, in addition to also completing our own inaugural sustainabilitylinked bond issuance for \u20ac750 million. Pernod Ricard employees also had the chance to come together once again for the 10 th annual Responsib'All Day, an entire day dedicated to making a positive impact in our communities. Our a/ff.short iliates rolled up their sleeves and took on several community projects that help protect and restore local nature and biodiversity.",

This year, we proudly launched our Arts Mentorship programme. Building on the Group's founding commitment to creativity, this programme takes young artists and designers under its wing and furthers our real desire to share, innovate and bring people together. This year, Sandra Rocha, mentor, and Perrine G\u00e9liot, mentee, worked together to develop an international artistic project which was presented at the Rencontres d'Arles photography festival in France in July.\n\n## Strong growth and financial trajectory\n\nDespite increasing global challenges, I've said many times over the past two years that Pernod Ricard would come out of the\n\ncrisis stronger than ever, and our results this year are the reflection of all that hard work. The incredible shared success achieved by my more than 19,000 colleagues worldwide ensured we reached the symbolic double-digit revenue figure, hitting \u20ac10.7 billion in net sales for the first time. Additionally, two financial milestones have been surpassed, with our Profit from Recurring Operating at \u20ac3 billion and our highest ever Free Cash Flow at \u20ac1.8 billion.\n\nAbsolut broke 12 million cases sold worldwide, while Jameson broke 10 million and Ballantine's 9 million. Indeed, our splendid portfolio of Scotch whiskies grew by an impressive 25%, while Martell grew by 7%. These are just some examples of the record sales of so many of the brands across our unrivalled portfolio.\n\nI am extremely proud to say that we have been able to ring the 'double-digit growth' bell many times this year, in markets across the Asian/Rest of the World and European regions, which are both growing at an impressive rate of 19%. We have seen our 'must win' markets continue to progress, with the US reporting +8%, China +5% and India a successful +26%, while Global Travel retail rebounded impressively as many parts of the world reopened post-Covid.\n\n2.1 billion: that is the number of bottles that we produced and distributed last year at a global level for our more than 240 brands. It is an impressive figure, but it does not say enough about the talent and commitment of my colleagues who made these accomplishments possible, under the most di/ff.short  icult and challenging context our industry has experienced for some time.\n\n## Bringing our purpose to life\n\nIf these last two years have taught us anything, it's that there's no one way to connect. So, whether it's a family gathered around a table to celebrate a happy occasion, or friends both near and far catching up in person or digitally, these irreplaceable bonds are now, and always will be, absolutely vital.\n\nThis is the future we are crafting as more than 19,000 convivialists. Never before has our company been so sure about the change and impact we will make. We will do so by using my grandfather's motto to 'make a new friend every day.' It is timeless advice. I invite each and every one of us to make a new connection every day, to make the world a more convivial place. Because there is no doubt that a more convivial world is a better world for all of us.\n\n## 'We reached the symbolic double-digit revenue figure, hitting \u20ac10.7 billion in net sales for the fi rst time.'\n\n1.",

Constantly evolving thanks to a dynamic management policy driven by brand acquisitions or disposals, this portfolio allows Pernod Ricard to tap into new consumer trends while investing in the most promising segments and brands.\n\n## Our House of Brands\n\nTo ensure an optimal allocation of resources for key brands across all our markets, the Group uses its brand planning tool, the House of Brands, which encompasses five brand categories:\n\nStrategic International Brands represent the largest part of our business and our international potential. They are our worldwide top priorities and the reference brands in each category.\n\nPrestige Brands, our portfolio of highly desirable global luxury brands, target our most a/ff.short luent consumers all over the world. It is the industry's most comprehensive portfolio, spanning all major luxury categories and moments of conviviality.\n\nStrategic Wines cover a wide range of origins and tastes. Shared over a meal with friends or on more formal occasions, wine is increasingly appreciated around the world by a growing variety of consumers.\n\nSpecialty Brands meet a growing demand for smaller-scale 'craft' products. Authentic, these brands o/ff er a unique and comprehensive value proposition that responds to new consumer trends and expectations.\n\nStrategic Local Brands are strongly rooted in a limited number of specific markets. They benefit from very strong local consumer loyalty. This part of our portfolio often boosts our route-to-market.\n\n## Prioritising our investments\n\nUsing the House of Brands and in-depth consumer insight, we have developed the following categorisation to define the appropriate investment strategy according to the profile of each brand:\n\nStars - our leading brands sold internationally or locally - benefit from significant investment to enable them to continue leading in di/ff erent categories. These actively contribute to the Group's growth.\n\nGrowth Relays also benefit from increased resources as they serve to capture various moments of conviviality in highly attractive categories. At the same time, they o/ff er a promising growth outlook in the medium and long term.\n\nBastions are brands that are mature or in very competitive sales categories. They receive enough investment to ensure that we protect their market share, sales and profits.\n\nThe House of Brands a/ff ords us  the agility to make investment choices that strike the right balance between short-, medium- and long-term goals, while continuing to build brands that excel throughout our must-win geographies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together, we commit to bringing to life the Group's vision of 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' and to achieving our leadership ambition. At Pernod Ricard, we are:\n\n- \u00b7 Focused on performance\n- \u00b7 Going the extra mile\n- \u00b7 Dedicated to all our stakeholders\n\nPernod Ricard gives the opportunity to each and every convivialist to experience an inclusive conviviality culture. By customising individual employee experiences to leverage and grow skills, we fully reciprocate the energy that employees put into going the extra mile. Accordingly, levels of employee commitment, pride and support for the Group's values have been above external market benchmarks and in line with top performing organisations for over a decade. (1) An inclusive and diverse culture that mirrors the broad spectrum of our consumer base has been further strengthened in recent years by the 'Live without Labels' diversity roadmap and the gender parity 'Better Balance' programme, demonstrating the Group's consistent and progressive commitment to providing an outstanding work environment. As 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' leading and shaping industry growth, the Group holds a place among the world's most admired companies, (2) the 'best employers' in France (3) and the companies most preferred by business school students. (4)\n\n## 02.\n\n## Our business model: decentralisation\n\nWhile respecting the autonomy of our a/ff.shortiliates, we combine the strengths of a large group with the decision speed that decentralisation o/ffers to local markets. This means:\n\n- \u00b7 Decision-making based close to the market\n- \u00b7 Fast responses to consumer needs\n\nAs needs among consumers continue to shift towards more local consumption and genuine brand experiences, Pernod Ricard's HQ pilots new forms of conviviality to fit any occasion. We pilot major cross-functional projects and pool certain areas of expertise so that local a/ff.shortiliates can focus on the essentials: growing their business in their market by putting the consumer at the centre of their e/fforts. Individual market development plans bring conviviality directly to the consumer as we optimise the the right drink for the right occasion at the right time, every time. From this proximity to local markets comes increased authenticity, with conviviality serving as a performance accelerator that maximises exchanges and collaboration among local colleagues.\n\n## Our core values: the heart of our corporate culture\n\nOur three core values shape our culture and create a bond between all Pernod Ricard employees, regardless of their function, region or a/ff.shortiliate. These values only make sense when expressed within a convivial environment: there is no entrepreneurial spirit, mutual trust or sense of ethics without the simple, informal, inclusive and transparent relationships that define conviviality.\n\n## ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT\n\n- \u00b7 Autonomy\n- \u00b7 Initiative\n- \u00b7 Boldness\n- \u00b7 Taste for risk\n\nSince the Group's founding, entrepreneurial spirit has been one of the key factors di/fferentiating Pernod Ricard from its competitors. We cultivate it by encouraging creativity and innovation within our teams, which permit our employees to thrive. The Pernod Ricard Leadership Model also fosters entrepreneurial spirit through a set of specific competencies such as courage, driving vision and purpose, decision quality, resourcefulness and more. These Leadership Attributes are used globally for assessing, developing and growing our leaders and teams.\n\n## MUTUAL TRUST\n\n- \u00b7 Freedom of initiative\n- \u00b7 Open dialogue\n- \u00b7 Right to make mistakes\n\nWe work in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust. There can be no conviviality without trust in those taking the initiative. In the same way, trust is the basis of our relationships both internally and externally. We are committed to sharing our knowledge with partners and working with them to define shared values throughout our supply chain, ensuring all our activities are safe, respectful and responsible.\n\n## SENSE OF ETHICS\n\n- \u00b7 Respect\n- \u00b7 Transparency\n- \u00b7 Good relationships with stakeholders\n\nConviviality thrives when it is defined by moderation. Because the way we do business matters, we rely on each of our employees to encourage and support responsible drinking. With this in mind, we launched a worldwide massive open online course (MOOC) on alcohol and responsible drinking. Mandatory for all our employees, its aims are both to inform and to encourage a strong individual commitment to responsible drinking. Our business, which is the production and distribution of alcoholic products, has an inherent need for a strong sense of responsibility, and ethics is a core element of our culture and daily activities. Respect is the foundation of mutual trust as well as a key ingredient for a diverse and inclusive corporate culture where everyone can be themselves and grow.",

To ensure their success, we have launched our growth engine The Conviviality Platform. Through the execution of our three-year strategic plan, Transform & Accelerate, we will leverage consumer trends and deliver profitable growth.\n\n## Conviviality: the permanent heartbeat of our business\n\nThe last two years have been characterised by uncertainty, leading to deep shifts in the way we live, work and play. In the face of a challenging geopolitical context and unprecedented changes in the workforce, the ways that people are seeking human connection are changing.\n\nAmid these shifting environments, our vision of being 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' has remained the consistent force that keeps us focused in the present while allowing us to plan for the future. It is also what has led us to define a new mission that integrates our S&R strategy into the heart of our business: to unlock the magic of human connection by Bringing Good Times from a Good Place. The future of our business depends on responsible, sustainable conviviality, and through this pursuit we plan to shape and lead industry growth. Strengthened by our\n\ngrowth model, The Conviviality Platform, these tenets define our long-term business strategy.\n\n## Dedicated strategic priorities for the next three years\n\nWhile The Conviviality Platform will be the growth model of the Group's business for at least a decade, the next three years require a dedicated set of strategic priorities to address global and persistent changes to supply chains and consumption patterns. These have been provoked in large part by the pandemic and geopolitical challenges. The evolution of our Transform & Accelerate strategic plan identifies key drivers of growth that will allow us to confront these disruptions.\n\nOur aim is to strengthen our business from the inside out, innovating new forms of conviviality that respond to consumer desires. We will pay special attention to\n\nglobal consumer macrotrends, such as technology and the rise of the a/ff.shortluent and middle classes. By continuously innovating how to bring people together and create conviviality in new ways, we will build a foundation for long-term and sustainable business growth",

A purposeful and powerful growth model, The Conviviality Platform unites our existing competitive advantages with new technologies to deliver on our mission to unlock the magic of human connection by bringing Good Times from a Good Place.\n\n## Unleashing more conviviality using the power of data and AI\n\nA balanced and diversified growth model, The Conviviality Platform leverages data and technology to boost our core business and expand beyond our historical sources of revenue, capturing ever more opportunities both in the short term and for the future. This long-term model translates into concrete action plans through the next phase of Transform & Accelerate, our three-year strategic plan. With the broadest brand portfolio in the industry, which covers all moments of consumption, creating moments of conviviality is the core value proposition of Pernod Ricard's steady growth. By analysing both consumer demand as well as every aspect of our business using responsibly sourced data and ethically developed AI, we're able to generate and fulfil demand, with precision at scale, o/ffering the right products at the right price to the right consumer, for every occasion and in every\n\nmarket. As technology becomes a new competitive advantage for the Group, we will be able to anticipate market trends, increase speed and agility in decision making, and empower our people.\n\nWe have defined two key dimensions to stretch our growth: getting 'more from the core' to maximise value share in each market, and 'expanding beyond' to pioneer new opportunities for value creation. These two growth dimensions mutually enrich each other, creating additional business value through data-powered innovation.\n\n## Accelerating to get more from the core\n\nThe first dimension of our growth model is structured around three growth axes to get more value out of our existing portfolio:\n\n- \u00b7 Activating more brands with the right level of investment;\n- \u00b7 Maximising the pricing power of our brands;\n- \u00b7 Growing our positions within the Prestige market.\n\nWith the key data and AI programmes developed by Pernod Ricard - Maestria, Matrix, D-Star and Vista Rev-Up - our aim is to empower our people with more insights about consumer preferences. The ultimate objective is to maximise value share, while ensuring our portfolio meets our long-term ambition to attract and retain consumers.\n\n## Expanding beyond to pioneer the future\n\nUsing the strength of our core business, we are able to take bolder steps and go beyond to pioneer new avenues of growth and shape our own future. We have defined three specific growth areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Scaling-up innovation with new products and categories;\n- \u00b7 Broadening our coverage of the route-to-consumer;\n- \u00b7 Stretching our boundaries to include experiences and services.",

The Foundations of the Transform & Accelerate strategy ensure that we strengthen our inclusive culture of conviviality to empower our employees and accelerate our performance and transformation.\n\n## Accelerate by engaging each convivialist\n\nTwo action plans define our commitment to our people: being an outstanding place to work and o/ffering exciting career journeys to our convivialists. Pernod Ricard promises employees a convivial culture that is both diverse and inclusive. Our global Diversity & Inclusion frameworks bring the two complementary aspects together at the global level, defining clear objectives and KPIs that permit local adaptations based on a/ff.shortiliate needs. Across regions, the Youth Action Council facilitates the exchange of innovative ideas for increasing diversity and inclusion within the company by connecting the next generation with top leadership. 43% of Pernod Ricard management is female, and Pernod Ricard North America has earned the title of 'Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality' for six years in a row.

To engage each convivialist in both their personal success and that of the Group, a massive upskilling campaign is underway, supported by the development of personalised skill-based career paths. Each employee brings unique strengths to the table, and they deserve customised opportunities to leverage and grow their skills.\n\n## Transform by going beyond budget\n\nValue creation is only valuable if it is lasting and sustainable. While Pernod Ricard has registered record growth in the past two years, we must continue to future-proof our business model through two action plans: going beyond budget to beat the competition and improving resiliency, agility and sustainability. Using scaled-up technology and data, supported by new collaborative ways of working and mature sales and operations planning, the Group will\n\n(1) Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, 2022.\n\nbegin deploying three-year mandates and 18-month rolling forecasts. This continuous momentum will lead to increased visibility and long-term strategic opportunities that will allow us to unlock growth and make the whole more than the sum of its parts. A continuous enrichment process, it will be key to leading and shaping the industry. The past two years have been defined by volatility. From the responses to and impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions to material scarcity and geopolitical turmoil, uncertainty has become a permanent part of life. Building a profitable future for the Group will thus require improved resiliency, agility and sustainability that is based on anticipatory planning instead of reactivity. Through better information sharing, tools, planning and capabilities, our sales and operations process will become more robust and better protected from market volatility.",

An integral part of all business activities, from grain to glass, the 2030 Sustainability & Responsibility (S&R) roadmap is key to leading and shaping the industry, and an important lever for accelerating transformation.\n\nBuilt around four pillars and 33 targets, 'Good Times from a Good Place' addresses both consumer needs and material risks facing the Group. Only three years after its launch, we are already on track to meet and even outperform several of these ambitious targets. In addition to the roadmap, we are continually looking to further strengthen our commitment to sustainable and responsible thinking. We took several industry-leading steps to do so in FY22. In November 2021, executive pay and annual bonuses were directly linked to the Group S&R performance, while in April 2022, Pernod Ricard launched the industry's first ever sustainability-linked bond. This was followed by the announcement of a new addition to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Executive Board in July 2022: an EVP of Corporate Communication, S&R and Public A/ffairs to strengthen our governance.\n\nBeyond these important advancements, our work is far from complete.

To ensure we maintain healthy and resilient ecosystems that allow us to source quality ingredients now and for generations to come, we are committed to nurturing every terroir and its biodiversity and to addressing the challenges of climate change (SDG 13). That's why we have been working hand in hand with our farmers, suppliers and communities to transform agricultural practices into generative actions that will help mitigate climate change, protect life on land (SDG 15), restore the soil and improve livelihoods throughout the world - for a long-term, positive impact.\n\nVALUING PEOPLE As 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9,' we believe in sharing, warmth, care and respect for people everywhere. We strive to provide decent work and sustained economic growth (SDG 8) along the entirety of our value chain, and we champion gender equality (SDG 5) throughout our business. To create shared value for all our stakeholders, we strive to procure all goods and services responsibly, protect human rights, foster diversity and inclusion, and create a healthy and safe environment for all. We are also committed to providing our employees with future-fit training and educating the bartending community on responsible and sustainable practices.\n\nCIRCULAR MAKING The world is made of finite resources that are under huge pressure. By contributing to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and protecting life below water (SDG 14), our goal is to help reduce carbon emissions, water consumption and waste. To do this, we apply five key principles at each step of our product lifecycle: Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Respect. In moving towards a more circular business model, we are actively striving to preserve and regenerate our natural resources at every step of our value chain - from the raw materials we source, to the way we conceive and produce our products, to how they are distributed and then ultimately reused or recycled.\n\nRESPONSIBLE HOSTING We want to ensure our brands are enjoyed responsibly. Creating conviviality requires us to help adult consumers make responsible choices about whether, when and how much to drink. We have an important role to play in combating the harmful use of alcohol and supporting health and well-being (SDG 3). To this end, we develop responsible drinking campaigns and programmes, in partnership with others (SDG 17), to inform consumers and our employees about the risks of excessive drinking. We are committed to marketing and selling our products responsibly and providing our consumers with a responsible experience. Our brands are also committed to delivering responsibility messages to our consumers through marketing campaigns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2192 Completing terroir mapping and risk assessment\n- \u2192 Reaching gender pay equity\n- \u2192 Launching first circular distribution pilot with ecoSPIRITS\n- \u2192 Launching digital labels for major brands\n\n1.",

He began his career at Roche in 2001, where he held several positions in pharmaceutical development in Switzerland and the United States.\n\nIn 2013, he then became a management controller within Naval Group's teams, followed by Airbus Helicopters. At the end of 2015, he joined the Pernod Ricard Group as Management Controller for the companies Ricard and Pernod, where he stayed until 2019 when he became Master Data Manager of Pernod Ricard France.\n\nIn November 2021, following his election by the France Group Committee, he was appointed Director representing the employees within the Board of Directors of Pernod Ricard SA.\n\nVery involved in the Group, Mr Brice Thommen has also held several positions as employee representative within the Group (elected member of the SEC at Ricard and then Pernod Ricard France, member and secretary of the France Group Committee).\n\n## Offices and main functions held outside the Group on 30.06.2022 or at the date of resignation where applicable\n\n- None glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nOffices held within the Group that have expired over the last five years\n\n- None glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe Directors do not hold any salaried positions within the Group, with the exception of Mr C\u00e9sar Giron, Chairman and CEO of Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt, Ms Patricia Ricard Giron (Permanent Representative of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard, Director), Ms Maria Jesus Carrasco Lopez, Director representing the employees and Regional Trade Marketing Manager at Pernod Ricard Espa\u00f1a, and Brice Thommen, Director representing the employees and Master Data Manager at Pernod Ricard France in Marseille.\n\n## Governance structure 2.4\n\n## Reunification of the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors 2.4.1 and CEO\n\nSince Mr Pierre Pringuet's term of office as Chief Executive Officer expired on 11 February 2015, and since the Chairwoman of the Board of Directors at the time (Ms Dani\u00e8le Ricard) wished to step down from the Board, during its meeting of 11 February 2015 the Board resolved, in accordance with the French Commercial Code and the AFEP-MEDEF Code adopted by the Company, to combine the positions of Chairman and CEO and appointed Mr Alexandre Ricard as Chairman and CEO. The Company has also appointed a Lead Independent Director on 23 January 2019. In addition, in order to provide the checks and balances necessary in the exercise of such powers, as well as good governance, the Company sought to establish guarantees, notably:\n\n- as part of the Group's Senior Management, the Chairman and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> CEO relies on two management bodies:\n- the Executive Board, which endorses all major decisions glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> relating to the Group's strategy, and\n- the Executive Committee, which ensures coordination glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> between the Headquarters and its affiliates, in accordance with the Group's decentralised model;\n- limitations on the powers of the Chairman and CEO by the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Board of Directors: prior authorisation by the Board of Directors is necessary in particular for external growth transactions or disinvestments for amounts greater than \u20ac100 million and for loans exceeding \u20ac200 million (see the Subsection 2.4.3 \"Limitation on the powers of the Chairman and CEO' hereinafter); and\n- five specialised Committees, responsible for preparing the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> work of the Board of Directors relating to the following topics: audit, compensation, nominations and governance, strategy and CSR. These Committees are mainly composed of independent Directors (1) , the Company being in line with or going beyond the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code on the percentage of independent Directors (Audit Committee: 67% vs. 67% recommended; Compensation Committee: 100% vs. 50% recommended; Nominations and Governance Committee: 67% vs. 50% recommended; Strategic Committee: 67% vs. no recommendation and CSR Committee: 67% vs. no recommendation).\n\n2.",

He oversees the proper operation of the Company's managing bodies and ensures, in particular, that the Directors are in a position to fulfil their duties. He can also request any document or information which can be used to help the Board prepare its meetings.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman and CEO is granted full powers to act in the name of the Company under any circumstances. He exercises these powers within the limits of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to the General Meetings and to the Board, and within the internal limits as defined by the Board of Directors and its Internal Regulations (1) .\n\n## Limitation on the powers 2.4.3 of the Chairman and CEO\n\nFor internal purposes, following the decision made by the Board of Directors on 11 February 2015 and in accordance with article 2 of the Board's Internal Regulations (1) , prior to making a commitment on behalf of the Company, the Chairman and CEO must obtain prior authorisation from the Board of Directors for any significant transactions that fall outside the strategy announced by the Company, as well as the following transactions:\n\n- carrying out acquisitions, transfers of ownership or disposals glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of assets and property rights and making investments for an amount exceeding \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- signing any agreements to make investments in, or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> participate in joint ventures with, any other French or non-French companies, except with an affiliate of Pernod Ricard (as defined in article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code);\n- making any investments or taking any shareholding in any glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> company, partnership or investment vehicle, whether established or yet to be established, through subscription or contribution in cash or in kind, through the purchase of shares, ownership rights or other securities, and more generally in any form whatsoever, for an amount above \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- granting loans, credits and advances exceeding \u20ac100 million glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> per borrower, except when the borrower is an affiliate of Pernod Ricard (as defined in article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code) and with the exception of loans granted for less than one year;\n- borrowing, with or without granting a guarantee on corporate glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> assets, exceeding \u20ac200 million in the same financial year, except from affiliates of Pernod Ricard (as defined in article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code), for which there is no limit;\n- granting pledges, sureties or guarantees, except with express glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> delegation of authority from the Board of Directors, within the limits provided for by articles L. 225-35 and R. 225-28 of the French Commercial Code; and\n\nOn 10 November 2021, the Board of Directors authorised the Chairman and CEO, for a period of one year, to grant pledges, sureties or guarantees in the name of the Company up to an overall limit of \u20ac100 million, and for an unlimited amount to tax and customs authorities.

The Board of Directors of the Company comprises no fewer than 3 and no more than 18 members, unless otherwise authorised by law. In accordance with the Company's articles of association, each Director must own at least 50 Company shares in registered form. However, the Board's Internal Regulations (2) recommend that, during their term of office and no later than two years following their appointment, Directors acquire a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to one year's worth of compensation (fixed and variable portions) payable to a Director who has attended all meetings of the Board of Directors (excluding compensation related to participation in Committees) (3) .\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting and are proposed by the Board of Directors following the recommendations of the Nominations and Governance Committee. They can be dismissed at any time by decision of the General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the law of 22 May 2019 on business growth and transformation (PACTE law) and the Company's articles of association (1) , the number of Directors representing the employees who are members of the Board depends on the number of Directors of the Board. Given the composition of the Board of Directors, there are two Directors representing the employees since 2018. They sit on the Board of Directors. One is appointed by the Group Committee (France) and the other by the European Group Committee.\n\nA representative of the Company's Economic and Social Committee attends the meetings of the Board of Directors in an advisory role.\n\nThe Board of Directors may, upon proposal of its Chairman, appoint one or more non-voting Board members, who may be either individuals or legal entities and who may or may not be shareholders.\n\nThe term of office of each Director is four years. However, on an exceptional basis, the General Meeting may, following the Board of Directors' proposal, appoint Directors or renew their term of office for a period of two years so as to enable a staggered renewal of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Nominations and Governance Committee regularly evaluate the composition of the Board and its Committees as well as the different skills and experience brought by each Director. They also identify the guidelines to be issued in order to ensure the best balance possible by seeking complementary characteristics from both an international and diversity perspective, in terms of nationality, gender, and experience. In accordance with article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the table below describes the Board of Directors' diversity policy, indicating the criteria taken into consideration, the targets set by the Board, the way it has been implemented and the results achieved over FY22.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "The composition of the Board of Directors is diversified and complementary. It is also fully in line with Pernod Ricard's strategy. The expertise of Board members thus covers in particular the following areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Selection process for candidates 2.5.3 as Independent Directors\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code's recommendations, the Nominations and Governance Committee has implemented a selection process for candidates for positions on the Board of Directors in the event of vacancy of any kind or new appointments.\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee formalises the criteria for selecting new Directors with the aim of reaching a balanced representation and complementarity between the different profiles on the Board of Directors. Regarding the determination of the selection criteria, the Nominations and Governance Committee takes into account the Board of Directors' diversity policy, not only in terms of expertise, but also in terms of independence, gender representation, nationality and seniority, as well as any specific expectations of the Board expressed during the evaluation of its functioning.\n\nOnce the needs of the Board of Directors have been identified and the selection criteria formalised, the Nominations and Governance Committee, with the support of a firm specialised in the recruitment of Directors, draws up a list of potential candidates. The Committee then organises interviews with the shortlisted candidates to ascertain their independence, availability, motivation and commitment to the Group's values.\n\nFollowing these interviews and after having reviewed the different profiles, the Nominations and Governance Committee makes its recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the appointment of one or more candidates. The Board analyses the various profiles that have been submitted and presents the appointment of the final candidates to the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn accordance with the Internal Regulations (1) of the Board of Directors, each Director may, if he or she deems it necessary, receive training on the specific features of the Company, its businesses and its business sector at the time of their appointment and throughout their term of office.\n\nThey may also, if they wish, meet with the Directors of the Company's operational teams, after having informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThus, during FY22, Mr Brice Thommen received specific training.\n\n## Changes in the composition 2.5.4 of the Board of Directors\n\n## During FY22\n\nThe General Meeting of 10 November 2021 renewed, for a period of four years expiring at the end of the General Meeting held in 2025 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year, the terms of office as Directors of Ms Anne Lange and Ms Veronica Vargas, as well as that of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard.\n\nYou are reminded that the permanent representative of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard was Mr Paul-Charles Ricard until 20 December 2021, when he was replaced by Ms Patricia Ricard Giron. In addition, at the same General Meeting, Ms Namita Shah was appointed as an Independent Director for a term of four years.\n\n## During FY23\n\nAs the terms of office as Directors of Ms Patricia Barbizet and Mr Ian Gallienne expire at the end of the General Meeting of 10 November 2022, this General Meeting will be asked (4 th and 5 th resolutions), in accordance with the recommendations of the Nominations and Governance Committee, to renew their terms of office as Directors for a term of four years expiring at the end of the General Meeting to be held in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nMs Patricia Barbizet brings her experience as Chief Executive Officer (at Artemis and Christie's) to the Board, as well as her valuable expertise in the luxury and retail sectors, in corporate governance and CSR. Ian Gallienne notably brings to the Board his experience as a diligent and demanding investor.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Ms Patricia Barbizet\n\nA graduate of ESCP Europe, Ms Patricia Barbizet began her career in 1976 with the Treasury Department of the Renault V\u00e9hicules Group before becoming Financial Director of Renault Cr\u00e9dit International. In 1989, she joined the Pinault Group as Chief Financial Officer and became, from 1992 to 2018, Chief Executive Officer of Art\u00e9mis, the Pinault family's investment company. From 2014 to 2016, she was also CEO & Chairwoman of Christie's International and chaired the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) Investment Committee from 2008 to 2013. She is currently Chairwoman of Temaris & Associ\u00e9s. Ms Patricia Barbizet is also Chairwoman of the Board of Directors of the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique - Philharmonie de Paris, Chairwoman of Zo\u00e9 SAS and Director of Colombus. In April 2018, she was appointed Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board of Investissements d'Avenir France 2030. In addition, she has been Chairwoman of the High Committee on Corporate Governance since 1 November 2018.\n\n## Independence of Directors 2.5.5\n\nThe Company applies criteria of independence as expressed in the AFEP-MEDEF Code (see table hereunder). A member of the Board of Directors is considered 'independent' when they have no relationships of any kind with the Company, its Group or its Management, which could impair the free exercise of his/her judgement (article 3 of the Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors (2) ).\n\n## Mr Ian Gallienne\n\nMr Ian Gallienne has been CEO of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert since January 2012. He graduated in Management and Administration, specialising in Finance, from ESDE in Paris and holds an MBA from INSEAD in Fontainebleau. From 1998 to 2005, he was Manager of the Rh\u00f4ne Capital LLC private equity fund in New York and London. From 2005 to 2012, he was founder and Managing Director of the private equity funds Ergon Capital Partners I, II and III. Mr Ian Gallienne has been a Director of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert since 2009, of Imerys since 2010, of SGS since 2013, of Adidas since 2016 and of Webhelp since 2019.\n\nThus, at the close of the General Meeting of 10 November 2022, the Board of Directors would comprise 14 members (including two Directors representing the employees), of which seven Independent Directors (58.3%) (1) and seven women (58.3%) , in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the law on balanced representation of women and men within Boards of Directors and professional equality. Additionally, six Directors would be of foreign nationality (including the Directors representing the employees).\n\nTherefore, the Board of Directors and the Nominations and Governance Committee use the following criteria to assess the independence of Directors in their annual review as well as in the event of a co-option, an appointment or a renewal.\n\n## The AFEP-MEDEF independence criteria are the following:\n\n| Criterion 1 Not to be, or not to have been during the past five years, an employee or Executive Director of the Company, nor an employee, Executive Director or a Director of a company consolidated within the Company or of its Parent Company or a company consolidated within this Parent Company.   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Criterion 2 Not to be an Executive Director of a company in which the Company holds a directorship, directly                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Criterion 3 Not to be, or not to be directly or indirectly related to, a customer, supplier, commercial banker, investment banker or consultant that is material to the Company or its Group, or for which the Company                                                                                   |\n| Criterion 4 Not to be related by close family ties to a corporate officer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Criterion 5 Not to have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company within the previous five years.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Criterion 6 Not to have been a Director of the Company for more than 12 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Criterion 7 Non-Executive Directors: not to receive variable compensation in cash or securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or the Group.                                                                                                                               |\n| Criterion 8 Directors representing major shareholders (+10%) of the Company or its Parent Company may be considered as being independent, provided that these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company.                                                                               |",

N/A\n\n- means the Director fulfils the independence criterion concerned. X\n- The reappointments of Ms Patricia Barbizet and Mr Ian Gallienne as Directors are subject to the approval of the General Meeting of 10 November 2022. *\n- Given the passive crossing of the 10% voting rights threshold by GBL in February 2017 by virtue of automatic acquisition of double voting rights, ** the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors have examined this specific independence criterion and, in order to qualify Mr Ian Gallienne as an Independent Director, they have established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so, that GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard family, the Group's reference shareholder, and that there is no potential conflict of interest situation that could compromise his freedom of judgement.\n\nDuring the annual Directors' independence review, and as in the previous financial year, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors raised the question of the independence of Mr Ian Gallienne, a Director with ties to GBL, given the passive crossing of the 10% voting rights threshold by GBL in February 2017 by virtue of the automatic acquisition of double voting rights. Please note that Mr Ian Gallienne's experience in finance as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Group are an asset to the Board of Directors of Pernod Ricard.\n\nAccording to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Directors representing major shareholders of the Company may be considered as being independent, provided that these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company (criterion 8). At each crossing of a threshold of 10% of share capital or voting rights, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, is required to\n\nsystematically review a Director's independence in the light of the composition of the Company's share capital and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAccordingly, it has been established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so as stated in the notification of threshold crossing and declaration of intent published by the AMF on 23 February 2017:\n\n- GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> family, the Group's reference shareholder;\n- Mr Ian Gallienne does not chair any of the Board Committees glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and is not a member of the Nominations and Governance Committee; and\n- GBL does not intend to ask for the appointment of other glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Directors to sit on the Board.",

        "page_content": "The Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors also noted the absence of conflicts of interest, since:\n\n- crossing the threshold of 10% of voting rights is not likely to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> create a conflict of interest;\n- there is no significant business relationship between GBL glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and Pernod Ricard or its Group that could create a conflict of interest that could compromise his freedom of judgement;\n- GBL's capital entry was made independently of any glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> agreement with Pernod Ricard or the Ricard family;\n- GBL has the reputation of being a diligent and demanding glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> investor whose interests are aligned with those of all shareholders;\n- there is no agreement between GBL and Pernod Ricard or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the Ricard family relating to the presence of Mr Ian Gallienne or one or more GBL representatives on the Board of Directors. The presence of Mr Ian Gallienne is justified by his experience and his judgement, which are beneficial to the Board of Directors; and\n- Mr Ian Gallienne is not in a position to impose his view on the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Board of Directors, which has 14 members (including the Directors representing the employees).\n\nThus, these elements demonstrate freedom of judgement and an absence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, it should be noted that there is no new element likely to call into question the qualification of independent retained in the past.\n\nGiven these facts, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors considered that Mr Ian Gallienne fully meets the 'specific' independence criteria linked to the crossing of the threshold of 10% in share capital or voting rights.\n\nAfter consideration and review of the AFEP-MEDEF Code criteria mentioned above, the Board of Directors' meeting held on 20 July 2022, in accordance with the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, confirmed that seven out of the 12 Directors comprising the Board of Directors (excluding the Directors representing the employees) are deemed to be independent: Ms Patricia Barbizet, Ms Virginie Fauvel, Ms Anne Lange, Ms Kory Sorenson and Ms Namita Shah, and Mr Ian Gallienne and Mr Philippe Petitcolin, representing more than half of the Board of Directors (58.3%), as required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## Succession plan 2.5.6\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee, at the initiative of its Chairwoman, Lead Independent Director of the Board, periodically reviews the Group's succession plan. This allows her to establish and update a succession plan covering several time horizons:\n\n- short term: unexpected succession (resignation, incapacity, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> death);\n- medium term: accelerated succession (poor performance, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> lack of management); and\n- long term: planned succession (retirement, end of the term glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of office).\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee favours close collaboration with Senior Management in order to ensure overall consistency of the succession plan and to ensure a continuity in the key positions. In order to ensure the optimal development of the succession plan for the governing bodies and to meet the Company's strategic ambitions, a regular assessment of potential candidates, their careers and developments is carried out with the assistance of an independent firm.\n\nIn addition, the Nominations and Governance Committee works closely with the Board of Directors on this subject, and is particularly vigilant in maintaining the confidentiality of this information.\n\n## Directors' Code of Ethics 2.5.7\n\nArticle 5 of the Internal Regulations (1) , adopted by the Board of Directors on 17 December 2002, most recently amended on 21 April 2021, and article 16 of the articles of association (2) stipulate the rules of conduct that apply to Directors and their permanent representatives. Each Director acknowledges that he/she has read and understood these undertakings prior to accepting the office. The Internal Regulations also outline the various rules in force with regard to the conditions for trading in the Company's shares on the stock market and the notification and publication requirements relating thereto.\n\nMoreover, the Board of Directors' meeting of 16 February 2011 adopted a Code of Ethics to prevent insider trading and misconduct in compliance with legal undertakings, to comply with European regulations on market abuse. This Code was updated on 31 August 2022.\n\nDirectors, as well as any person attending meetings of the Board and its Committees, have access to sensitive information concerning the Company. As such, they are bound by a strict obligation of confidentiality. Consequently, they must take all necessary measures to preserve the confidentiality of this information.\n\nAs the Directors have sensitive information on a regular basis, they must refrain from using this information to buy or sell shares of the Company and from carrying out transactions involving Pernod Ricard's shares or any related financial instruments in the 45 days prior to the publication of the full-year results, the 30 days prior to the publication of the half-year results and the 15 days prior to the publication of quarterly net sales. This period is extended to the day after the announcement when it is made after the close of the markets (5.30pm, Paris time) and to the day of the announcement when it is made before the opening of the markets (9.00am, Paris time). In addition, the Code of Ethics states that they must seek the opinion of the Trading Committee, formerly called the Ethics Committee, before making any transactions involving the Company's shares or any related financial instrument.",

It is specified that this Charter formalises the process implemented to identify regulated agreements and that such process is followed prior to concluding, amending, renewing or terminating any agreements which would potentially be qualified as regulated, it being specified that the process applies to agreements considered as 'free' at the time of conclusion.\n\n## Shareholders' agreements\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Pernod Ricard was notified that a shareholder agreement had been signed between Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard. Pursuant to this agreement, Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza undertakes to consult Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard prior to any Pernod Ricard General Meeting of Shareholders in order to vote in the same way. Furthermore, Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza undertook to notify Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard of any additional purchase of Pernod Ricard shares and/or voting rights, and also undertook not to purchase any Pernod Ricard shares if such a transaction would force Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard and the parties acting in concert to launch a public offer for Pernod Ricard. Finally, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard has a pre-emption right with regard to any Pernod Ricard shares of which Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza may wish to dispose.\n\n## Absence of conviction for fraud, association with bankruptcy or any offence and/or official public sanction\n\n## To Pernod Ricard's knowledge and at the date hereof:\n\n- no conviction for fraud has been issued against any members glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the Company's Board of Directors or Senior Management over the last five years;\n- none of the members of the Board of Directors or Senior glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Management has been associated, over the last five years, with any bankruptcy, compulsory administration or liquidation as a member of a Board of Directors, Management Board or Supervisory Board or as a Chief Executive Officer;\n- no conviction and/or official public sanction has been issued glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> over the last five years against any members of the Company's Board of Directors or Senior Management by statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional organisations); and\n- no Director or member of the Senior Management has, over glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the last five years, been prohibited by a court of law from serving as a member of a Board of Directors, a Management Board or Supervisory Board or from being involved in the management or the running of an issuer's business affairs.\n\n## Services agreements\n\nNo member of the Board of Directors or member of the Senior Management has any service agreement with Pernod Ricard or any of its affiliates.\n\n## Employee representatives\n\nThe appointment of a Director or Directors representing the employees on the Board of Directors was introduced at the end of 2013. As a result, the representation of Pernod Ricard SA employees on the Board of Directors is now ensured by a single person. This is currently Mr Herv\u00e9 Jouanno.\n\n2.",

The Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors specify the rules and operations of the Board, and supplement the relevant laws, regulations and articles of association. In particular, they remind the Directors of the rules on diligence, confidentiality and disclosure of possible conflicts of interest.\n\n## Meetings of the Board 2.6.1 of Directors\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Chairman to call meetings of the Board of Directors regularly, or at times that he or she considers appropriate. In order to enable the Board to review and discuss in detail the matters falling within their area of responsibility, the Internal Regulations (1) provide that Board meetings must be held at least six times a year. In particular, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that Board meetings are held to close the interim and annual financial statements and to convene the General Meeting in charge of approving said statements.\n\nBoard meetings are called by the Chairman. The notice of the Board meeting, sent to the Directors at least eight days before the date of the meeting except in the event of a duly substantiated emergency, must set the agenda and state where\n\nthe meeting will take place, which will be, in principle, the Company's registered office. Board meetings may also be held by video conference or teleconference, under the conditions provided for in the applicable regulations and the Internal Regulations (1) .\n\nSince FY17, the Directors hold a session at least once a year without the Directors from the Group Top Management (Executive Sessions). The purpose of these Executive Sessions is to assess the operation of the Board of Directors, the performance of the Executive Director, and to review his succession plan. One Executive Session was held in FY22.\n\n## Information provided 2.6.2 to the Directors\n\nThe Directors receive the information they require to fulfil their duty. In accordance with the Internal Regulations, the supporting documents pertaining to matters on the agenda are provided far enough in advance, generally eight days before meetings, to enable them to prepare effectively for each meeting.\n\nA Director may ask for explanations or for additional information and, more generally, submit to the Chairman or the Lead Independent Director any request for information or access to information which he or she deems appropriate.\n\n## Directors' attendance at Board and Committee meetings during FY22 2.6.3\n\nDuring FY22, the Board of Directors met eight times with an attendance rate of 100%. The average duration of the meetings of the Board of Directors was approximately three hours and thirty minutes.\n\nNominations and\n\n|                                      | Board of Directors   | Audit Committee   | Governance Committee   | Compensation Committee   | Strategic Committee   | CSR Committee   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Alexandre Ricard                     | 8/8                  |                   |                        |                          | 1/1                   |                 |\n| Patricia Barbizet                    | 8/8                  |                   | 4/4                    | 5/5                      |                       | 3/3             |\n| Wolfgang Colberg                     | 8/8                  | 5/5               |                        |                          |                       |                 |\n| Virginie Fauvel                      | 8/8                  |                   |                        |                          | N/A (1)               |                 |\n| Ian Gallienne                        | 8/8                  |                   |                        | 5/5                      | 1/1                   |                 |\n| C\u00e9sar Giron                          | 8/8                  |                   | 4/4                    |                          |                       |                 |\n| Anne Lange                           | 8/8                  |                   | 4/4                    |                          | 1/1                   |                 |\n| Philippe Petitcolin                  | 8/8                  | 5/5               |                        |                          | 1/1                   |                 |\n| Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard (2)              | 8/8                  |                   |                        |                          | 1/1                   |                 |\n| Namita Shah (3)                      | 4/4                  |                   |                        |                          |                       | 1/1             |\n| Kory Sorenson                        | 8/8                  | 5/5               |                        | 5/5                      |                       |                 |\n| Veronica Vargas                      | 8/8                  |                   |                        |                          |                       | 3/3             |\n| Directors representing the employees |                      |                   |                        |                          |                       |                 |\n| Maria Jesus Carrasco Lopez (4)       | 8/8                  |                   |                        | 1/1                      |                       | 3/3             |\n| St\u00e9phane Emery (5)                   | 5/5                  |                   |                        | 4/4                      |                       |                 |\n| Brice Thommen (6)                    | 3/3                  |                   |                        |                          |                       |                 |\n| Average attendance rate              | 100%                 | 100%              | 100%                   | 100%                     | 100%                  | 100%            |\n\nNot applicable.

In addition, every three years a formalised external review with the support of a specialised consulting firm is carried out.\n\nDuring FY21, a formal assessment of the operations of the Board of Directors and its Committees was carried out with the support of an external firm specialising in governance, which, on the basis of formalised interview guidelines, conducted interviews with each of the Directors.\n\nThis year, Ms Patricia Barbizet, Lead Independent Director, conducted an internal assessment of the Board's operations on the basis of individual interviews with each Director. She presented the results of this assessment to the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nThis assessment shows that the Board has continued its positive development and that the recommendations resulting from the formal assessment have been mainly integrated and dealt with by the Board's management and secretariat. The Directors agreed that the Board currently deals effectively with the subjects presented to it. However, in the interest of constant improvement, the Directors noted that longer-term and more forward-looking subjects could be addressed more often in the Board or Committees.\n\n## Roles and activities of the Board of Directors 2.6.5\n\nMain roles\n\nIn exercising its legal prerogatives, the Board of Directors, notably:\n\n- rules on all decisions relating to the major strategic, economic, social and financial directions glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the Company and oversees their implementation by Senior Management;\n- deals with any issue relating to the smooth operation of the Company and monitors and controls these glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> issues. In order to do this, it carries out the controls and checks it considers appropriate, including the review of Company management;\n- approves investment projects and any transactions, especially any acquisitions or disposal transactions, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> that are likely to have a significant effect on the Group's profits, the structure of its balance sheet or its risk profile;\n- draws up the annual and half-yearly financial statements and prepares the General Meeting; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- defines the Company's financial communication policy; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- checks the quality of the information provided to the shareholders and to the markets; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- appoints the corporate officers responsible for managing the Company based on the proposition glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the Nominations and Governance Committee;\n- defines the compensation policy for the Senior Management based on the recommendations glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the Compensation Committee;\n- conducts an annual review of every individual Director prior to publishing the annual report and reports glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the outcome of this review to the shareholders in order to identify the Independent Directors; and\n- approves the report of the Board on corporate governance and the balanced representation of women glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and men; on the conditions governing the organisation of the Board's work; and on the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Company.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation report 2.8\n\nThis subsection was prepared with the assistance of the Compensation Committee in accordance with the regulations in force, in particular the provisions of Order No. 2020-1142 of 16 September 2020 (hereinafter the 'Order') supplemented by Decree No. 2020-1742 of 29 December 2020. This information also takes into account the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies.\n\nThe report on the Company's compensation for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 is presented below.\n\nFY22 is a record year with excellent performance, both balanced and sustainable, demonstrating the business model resilience and the organization agility.\n\nFY22 was a record year in many aspects : sales have broken the symbolic milestone of \u20ac10 billion, delivering a \u20ac3 billion profit from recurring operation, an operating margin of 28.3% and record volumes for both Jameson and Absolut.\n\nThe Growth was driven by all the regions (29% for Europe, 29% for Americas and 41% for Asia and rest of the world) and all our portfolio categories.\n\nFinally, the performance is sustainable thanks to our 'Good Times from a Good Place' roadmap.\n\nAs a reminder, the Compensation Committee is composed of four members, three of whom are independent and one member representing the employees. During the financial year, Mr St\u00e9phane Emery, representing the employees, was replaced by Ms Maria Jesus Carrasco Lopez. The Committee and the Board would like to thank Mr St\u00e9phane Emery for his active contribution to the meetings of the Compensation Committee and welcome Ms Maria Jesus Carrasco Lopez.\n\nThe role of the Compensation Committee is to review and propose to the Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to Executive Directors, as well as measures relating to their retirement schemes and any other benefits granted to them. To achieve this, the Compensation Committee assesses the rules governing the determination of the variable portion of the compensation of the Executive Director(s) annually and ensures that the criteria applied are in line with the Company's short-, medium- and long-term strategic orientations. It also ensures consistency between the compensation policy of the Executive Director(s) and members of the Executive Committee. The Compensation Committee also proposes to the Board of Directors the general policy for the allocation of long-term profit-sharing plans and, in particular, the conditions of these allocations applicable to the Company's Executive Directors. Finally, it validates the information given to the shareholders on the compensation of the Executive Director(s) (in particular the compensation policy and the components of the compensation submitted to the vote of the shareholders as part of the 'Say on Pay').\n\nThe compensation policy adopted by the Board of Directors on the proposal of the Compensation Committee includes incentives that reflect the Group's strategy of long-term profitable growth through responsible actions and compliance with the interests of the Company and its shareholders, both in terms of the correlation of compensation with the Company's short- and long-term performance and in terms of the policy of giving the executive a share of the capital and the associated share of risk. This compensation policy, which reflects the interests of the Company, is part of the Group's strategy and helps secure its long-term future. The performance conditions of the compensation policy for corporate officers are directly linked to the Group's performance metrics.\n\nThis year, the Compensation Committee met five times and proposed the recommendations made to the Board of Directors on the following main topics:\n\n- compensation due to the Chairman and CEO for FY22; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- analysis of the results of votes at the General Meeting of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 10 November 2021;\n- compensation policy for the Chairman and CEO; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- draft resolutions submitted to the General Meeting of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 10 November 2022;\n- corporate governance report, compensation of administrative glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and Management bodies, equity ratio.\n\nFollowing the results of the vote on the 10 th resolution at the General Meeting of 10 November 2021, the Compensation Committee met to analyse in detail the changes proposed to the compensation policy, placing the utmost importance on feedback from shareholders and proxy advisory firms. Thus, the Board of Directors has chosen to implement the decisions voted at the General Meeting and wished to reiterate that the proposed changes to the compensation policy were intended to ensure that it reflects and rewards achievement of the objectives set, encourages outperformance and is competitive in relation to the Company's main competitors.\n\nSince the appointment of Mr Alexandre Ricard in 2015, the Pernod Ricard Group's financial performance has accelerated significantly, illustrated in particular by the share price performance and excellent results.\n\nFor FY23, the compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard was, as every year, reviewed and compared with that of his main competitors but also with the practices of CAC 40 companies. These results enable the Board of Directors to assess whether the structure and the main components of the proposed policy are in line with practices each year.\n\nTo this end, the Board of Directors took into consideration:\n\n- Mr Alexandre Ricard's excellent performance; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the size, scope and complexity of the Company's global glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> business in its current and projected configuration;\n- the growing importance of CSR issues; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- aligning compensation with shareholders' interests. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn general, unless a significant change in the scope of responsibility, a significant gap in relation to the market or an overriding reason so requires, the possibility of revising the Executive Director's compensation policy is considered when the term of office is renewed. Following the analysis carried out for this financial year, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, does not propose any changes to the Executive Director's compensation policy. Mr Alexandre Ricard's compensation is both balanced, including a significant variable portion encouraging performance, adapted to his responsibilities and the Company's performance, and consistent with the leadership he demonstrates.\n\n2.",

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, shall then, by means of adaptation to the situations of the interested parties, determine the objectives, performance levels, parameters, structure and maximum percentages compared to their fixed annual compensation, which may not be higher than those of the Chairman and CEO.\n\nFurthermore, as regards the annual variable compensation policy, in the event of the arrival of a new Executive Director during the second half of a financial year, the Board of Directors will conduct a performance assessment at its discretion based on a proposal from the Compensation Committee and, in that case, the new Director will receive, as variable compensation, the prorated amount of the variable portion approved by the shareholders.\n\n## Fixed annual compensation\n\nThe fixed portion of the Executive Director's compensation is determined based on:\n\n- the level and complexity of his responsibilities; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- his experience and career history, particularly within the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Group;\n- his individual performance and; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- market analyses for comparable functions (study conducted glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> with the help of specialised firms on the positioning of the compensation of the Executive Director in relation to the practices of CAC 40 companies and international companies in the beverage sector for similar positions).\n\nThe possibility of a review of fixed compensation is analysed in detail at each reappointment. However, an early review might occur in the event of significant changes to the scope of responsibilities or a major deviation compared to the market positioning. In these specific situations, the adjustment of the fixed compensation and the reasons for it will be made public.\n\nFinally, the Board of Directors has decided that, in the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and CEO, a new Chief Executive Officer or any new Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s), these same principles will apply.\n\nAs a reminder, on 31 August 2021, the Board of Directors decided, on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, to increase the fixed annual compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard to \u20ac1,250,000, given the very high quality of his performance since his appointment in 2015 and to be better aligned with the CAC 40 median practice.\n\nThe gross fixed annual compensation of \u20ac1,250,000 for Mr Alexandre Ricard will be maintained for FY23.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "Compensation report\n\n## Compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Executive Director does not receive compensation for offices he or she holds in the Company or in Group companies.\n\n## Variable annual portion\n\nThe purpose of variable annual compensation is to compensate the performance achieved during the financial year by the Executive Director in terms of the annual performance objectives set by the Board of Directors in accordance with the corporate strategy. Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, the payment of variable annual compensation is conditional upon its prior approval by the Ordinary General Meeting ('ex-post' vote).\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee strive to strengthen the link between performance and compensation and to integrate a corporate social responsibility criterion.\n\nMore specifically, this variable portion is based on performance levels applying to financial and non-financial parameters, representative of expected overall performance.\n\nThis variable portion is expressed as a percentage of the fixed annual portion. It may vary between 0% and 110% if the quantitative and qualitative objectives are achieved (target level) and may rise to a maximum of 180% if the Group records exceptional financial and non-financial performance in relation to the objectives.\n\n## Performance criteria\n\nThe criteria are reviewed regularly to ensure they are in line with the Company long-term strategy and may be modified on an occasional basis. For FY23, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, proposed that the following criteria be reapplied:\n\n| Quantitative criteria : target 80% and max 150%   | Achievement of budgeted profit from recurring operations , restated for exchange rate and scope effects. This criterion, intended to provide an incentive to exceed the target for profit from recurring operations, is one of the key elements of the Group's decentralised structure. This concept of commitment to the budgeted profit from recurring operations helps to bring together all of the structures, which are rewarded according to the extent to which they meet their own targets for profit from recurring operations. This criterion rewards the management performance of the Executive Director   | target 20% and max 37.5%                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                   | Achievement of budgeted Group share of net profit from recurring operations , restated for exchange rate and scope effects. This criterion takes into account all of the Group's financial data that fall under the Executive Director's responsibility for the financial year and thus makes it possible for his compensation to be aligned with that of the shareholders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | target 20% and max 37.5%                          |\n|                                                   | Achievement of budgeted recurring free cash flow , restated for exchange rate and scope effects.

The Board's aim is therefore to continue to align the interests of Pernod Ricard employees with those of the shareholders, by encouraging them to hold shares of the Company. Just over 750 employees were rewarded, making it possible to target not only executives in management positions, but also to retain young high-potential managers (Talents) in all of the Group's affiliates around the world.\n\nThe conditions of the performance share allocation plan for FY23 will be identical to those of the previous financial year, in accordance with the resolution voted at the General Meeting of 10 November 2021 (resolutions 22).\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe performance shares granted will have a vesting period of three years and will be subject to the following performance conditions:\n\n## Breakdown of performance conditions by value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 50%   | 30%   | 20%   |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| PRO   | TSR   | CSR   |\n\n| Presence of performance condition      | Relative weight                     | Criterion detail                                                                                                                                                                  | Performance assessment methods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PRO (Profit from Recurring Operations) | 50% of the allocation in IFRS value | Average annual achievement of the Group's Profit from Recurring Operations ( PRO ) budget over three consecutive financial years, restated for scope and exchange rate effects    | average \u2264 0.95: 0% of the shares glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> average between 0.95 and 1: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> linear increase between 0% and 100% of the shares average \u2265 1: 100% of the shares glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                                                                                         |\n| TSR (Total Shareholder Return)         | 30% of the allocation in IFRS value | Positioning of the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share ( TSR ) compared to that of the panel of 12 peers* over a period of three years following the grant of the plan | below the median (8 th  to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 13 th  position): 0% of the shares at the median (7 th  position): 66% glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the shares 6 th , 5 th  or 4 th  position: 83% glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of the shares 3 rd , 2 nd  or 1 st  position: 100% glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> |\n\n2.",

This maximum allocation has been determined by taking into account:\n\n- the practices of CAC 40 and beverage sector companies glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (external benchmarking panel); and\n- the demanding nature of the performance conditions. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn addition, the maximum amount of performance shares granted to the Executive Director is limited to 0.08% of the share capital at the date of the allocation of the performance shares, as indicated in the resolutions approved by the General Meeting of 10 November 2021 (22 nd resolution).\n\n## Lock-in period\n\nThe Board of Directors requires the Executive Director:\n\n- to hold a number of shares in registered form until the end of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> his or her term of office, corresponding to:\n- in respect of stock options: 30% of the capital gain since glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> acquisition, net of social security contributions and taxes, resulting from the exercise of the stock options, and\n- in respect of performance shares: 20% of the volume of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the performance shares that actually vest;\n- to undertake to buy a number of additional shares equal to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 10% of the performance shares acquired at the time that the performance shares actually vest; and\n\n- once the Executive Director holds a number of registered glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Company shares that corresponds to more than three times his or her gross fixed annual compensation at that time, the above-mentioned lock-in obligation will be reduced to 10% for both stock options and performance shares and the Executive Director concerned will no longer be required to acquire additional shares. If, in the future, the registered holdings fall below the ratio of three times, the above-mentioned lock-in and vesting requirements will once more apply.\n\n## Presence condition and termination of office\n\nThe definitive allocation is subject to a presence condition (at the date on which the shares vest) for all beneficiaries including the Executive Director, with the exceptions specified in the plan regulations (notably in cases of death or disability) or decided by the Board of Directors. In case of the Executive Director, the Board of Directors may decide to remove the presence condition pro rata temporis where appropriate, issuing a notification of and justification for any such decision. The performance shares held shall remain subject to all applicable plan regulations, particularly with regard to the calendar and performance conditions.\n\n## Hedging\n\nIn accordance with the Code of Ethics, (the latest version of which was approved by the Board of Directors on 31 August 2022), and the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Executive Director has formally undertaken not to use hedging mechanisms either for stock options granted under previously established plans or shares resulting from the exercise of these options, or for performance shares received from the Company, until the end of the lock-in period set by the Board of Directors.",

The conditions relating to performance, presence and lock-in that will apply to these allocations will be the same as those outlined under the general Group performance share allocation plan in effect on the grant date; and\n- half ( i.e. 10%) in cash. It is specified that the Executive glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Director will undertake to invest the cash component of this additional compensation he may receive, net of social security contributions and tax, in savings products dedicated to financing his supplementary pension.\n\n## Policy on deferred commitments\n\n## Imposed departure clause\n\nA maximum allowance of 12 months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation determined by the Board of Directors) would be paid under performance conditions in the event of imposed departure as a result of a change in the Group's control or strategy. However, there would be no payment in the event of i) non-renewal of the term of office, ii) departure initiated by the Director, iii) a change of functions within the Group or iv) if he or she is able to benefit in the near future from their pension rights.\n\nThe imposed departure clause is subject to the following three performance criteria:\n\n- criterion number 1: bonus rates achieved over the term(s) of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> office: criterion number 1 will be considered as met if the average bonus paid over the entire length of the term(s) of office is no less than 90% of the target variable compensation;\n- criterion number 2: growth rate of profit from recurring glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> operations over the term(s) of office: criterion number 2 will be considered as met if the average growth rate of profit from recurring operations vs. budget of each year over the entire length of the term(s) of office is more than 95% (adjusted for foreign exchange and scope impacts); and\n- criterion number 3: average growth in net sales over the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> term(s) of office: criterion number 3 will be considered as met if the average growth in net sales over the entire length of the term(s) of office is greater than or equal to 3% (adjusted for foreign exchange and scope impacts).\n\nThe amount of compensation that may be received under the imposed departure clause shall be calculated according to the following scale:\n\n- if all three criteria are met, payment of 12 months' glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> compensation (1) ;\n- if two of the three criteria are satisfied: payment of eight glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> months' compensation (1) ;\n- if one of the three criteria is satisfied: payment of four glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> months' compensation (1) ; and\n- if no criterion is satisfied: no compensation will be paid. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Non-compete clause\n\nThe signing of this non-compete clause for a period of one year is intended to protect the Group by preventing the Executive Director from performing duties for a competitor, in return for an allowance of 12 months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation, determined by the Board of Directors).\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- the indemnity will be paid monthly during its term; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- it is provided in this clause that the Board of Directors may glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> waive the application of this clause when the Executive Director leaves;\n- the indemnity will not be paid if the Executive Director leaves glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the Group to take retirement or if the Executive Director is over 65 years old; and\n- the maximum amount of the indemnity under the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> non-compete clause and the imposed departure clause (sum of both) is capped at 24 months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation approved by the Board of Directors).\n\n## Multi-year compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided not to use this type of long-term cash compensation mechanism, preferring to favour a share-based instrument more closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nHowever, such a mechanism might be envisaged if regulatory changes or any other circumstance were to make the use of a share-based instrument restrictive or impossible. In this event, the principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and maximum allocation of shares stipulated in the policy relating to share plans will be used in the structuring of such variable multi-year compensation using the most similar appropriate procedures possible.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code (25.3.4), the Board of Directors has adopted the principle by which the Executive Director may receive exceptional compensation in certain circumstances (particularly in the case of transformational operations), which must be explicitly disclosed and justified.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code (article 25.4), in the case of external recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Board of Directors may also decide to pay an amount (in cash or in shares) to compensate the new Executive Director for loss of all or part of his or her compensation (excluding retirement benefits) related to leaving his or her previous position. This compensation may not exceed the amount lost by the person in question.\n\nIn all cases, the payment of such compensation may only be made subject to the prior approval of the Ordinary General Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n2.",

It may reach 70% of his gross fixed compensation if the quantitative and qualitative targets are achieved (target level) and can rise to a maximum of 105% if the Group records exceptional performance in relation to the targets. The criteria are reviewed regularly and may be modified on an occasional basis.\n\nIn this respect, during FY22, he received gross variable compensation of \u20ac494,736 in October 2021 relating to FY21, i.e. 101% of his fixed compensation for FY21.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nNo exceptional compensation was awarded or paid in respect of FY22.\n\n## Allocation of performance shares\n\nOn 10 November 2021, the Board of Directors authorised a global performance share allocation plan.\n\nUnder this plan, Mr C\u00e9sar Giron received the following allocation:\n\n- 1,168 shares subject to an external performance condition glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (\u20ac137,917.44 in IFRS value); and\n- 1,661 shares subject to internal performance conditions glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (\u20ac321,928.38 in IFRS value).\n\nThe details of the overall performance share allocation policy are shown below (pages 84-85 of this universal registration document).\n\n## Severance benefits\n\nMr C\u00e9sar Giron receives no compensation for termination of service.\n\n## Supplementary pension scheme\n\nMr C\u00e9sar Giron has a conditional supplementary defined-benefit pension scheme (article 39) under article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, provided that recipients:\n\n- have at least 10 years' seniority within the Group when they glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> leave or retire;\n- are at least 60 years of age on the date of leaving or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> retirement;\n- have claimed the basic and complementary French social glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> security pension schemes (ARRCO, AGIRC);\n- permanently end their professional career; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- end their professional career within the Group. In glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> accordance with regulations, employees aged over 55 whose contract is terminated and who do not take up another job are deemed to have retired. The aim of the scheme is to make it possible to supplement the pension provided by France's mandatory state-run pension scheme. It offers retired beneficiaries a life annuity that can be passed on to their spouse and/or ex-spouse in the event of death.\n\nPensions are proportionate to the beneficiary's length of service, with an upper limit of 20 years. Pensions are calculated on the basis of the beneficiary's average compensation (fixed and variable) over the three years preceding his or her retirement.\n\nThe amount of the supplementary annuity is calculated by applying the following coefficients to the basis of calculation:\n\n- for the portion of the compensation between 8 and 12 times glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> France's annual social security ceiling, the coefficient is 2% multiplied by the number of years' service (capped at 20 years, i.e. 40%);\n- between 12 and 16 times France's annual social security glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> ceiling, the coefficient is 1.5% per year of service (capped at 20 years, i.e. 30%); and\n- in excess of 16 times France's annual social security ceiling, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the coefficient is 1% per year of service (capped at 20 years, i.e. 20%).\n\nThe supplementary pension equals the sum of the three amounts above.\n\nIn addition, the rights granted under this plan, added to those of other pensions, cannot exceed two-thirds of the amount of the beneficiary's most recent fixed annual compensation.\n\nA provision is entered on the balance sheet during the build-up phase and, when the beneficiary claims his or her pension, the capital is transferred to an insurer and thus entirely outsourced.\n\nFunding for this scheme is the responsibility of Pernod Ricard, which pays premiums to a third-party insurance agency to which it has entrusted management of this pension scheme.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article D. 22-10-16 of the French Commercial Code, at 30 June 2022, the estimated gross amount of the pension potentially paid under the supplementary defined-benefit pension scheme for Mr C\u00e9sar Giron would amount to \u20ac183,140 per year.\n\nThe relevant social security contributions falling due to Pernod Ricard stood at 24% of the contributions transferred to the insurer.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the government decree of 3 July 2019:\n\n- the scheme has been closed since 2016; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- no additional rights may vest in respect of periods of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> employment after 1 January 2020.",

Just over 750 employees were rewarded, making it possible to target not only executives in management positions, but also to retain the \"Talents\" in all of the Group's affiliates around the world.\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed the following plan features on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee:\n\n- For young managers with potential ('Talents'): allocation of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> shares without performance condition;\n- For executives holding management positions: allocation of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> shares subject to internal performance conditions, introducing a CSR criterion in addition to the internal financial performance criterion.

In line with the Group's decentralised structure, the terms and conditions of each of these agreements are negotiated at the level of each entity concerned.\n\nSimilarly, outside France, the Group encourages all affiliates to implement local agreements enabling employees to share in the profits of the entity to which they belong.\n\nProfit-sharing agreements of this type exist in countries including Ireland and the United Kingdom: in each of these countries, employees may potentially receive Pernod Ricard shares based on their entity's annual results.\n\n## Provisions for pension benefits\n\nDetails of the total amount of provisions recorded or otherwise recognised by the issuer for the payment of pensions are set out in Note 4.7 Provisions in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Equity ratio between the level of compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard, Chairman and CEO, and the average and median compensation of the Company's employees\n\nInformation concerning the ratios between the compensation of the Chairman and CEO and the average and median compensation of the Company's employees is presented below in accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Calculation method\n\nThe average and median compensation was established on a full-time equivalent basis for the Company's employees other than the Chairman and CEO.\n\nThis compensation, taken into account on a gross basis, includes the following elements: fixed compensation, variable annual compensation, additional payments under the supplementary defined-contribution pension scheme, employee savings schemes and long-term incentive measures valued at their fair value at the date of allocation, as recognised in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 2. This valuation corresponds to a historical value at the grant date calculated for accounting purposes. It does not represent a current market value, nor the value that could be received by the beneficiary upon the eventual vesting of these securities, especially if the performance conditions are not met.\n\nThe scope of employees included only covers employees who were present continuously for two consecutive financial years. For part-time employees, compensation has been established on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nThe ratios and annual changes in compensation were calculated on the basis of the gross compensation components paid or awarded in the current year (thus including the variable compensation and profit-sharing allocated in respect of the prior year). The legal scope of this information covers Pernod Ricard SA. In addition, in accordance with recommendation 26.2 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the ratios are also published for a broader scope, representative of the Group's business in France, including Pernod Ricard SA and all direct and indirect affiliates located in France.",

They ensure consistency between the compensation policy for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee and the integration of social responsibility criteria in their variable compensation.\n\nIn regularly reviewing the various aspects of compensation, the members of the Compensation Committee pay particular attention to ensuring that the policy applied to the Executive Director is consistent with the policy applied to the Group's Senior Management both in France and internationally.\n\nThe compensation of the members of the Executive Board (excluding the Chairman and CEO), which is set by Senior Management, comprises a fixed annual portion, plus a variable portion representing an attractive incentive, for which the criteria are largely based on the Group's financial performance, as is the case for the Executive Director. Qualitative criteria to evaluate individual performance are also applied to this variable financial portion.\n\nThe Chairmen of the Group's direct affiliates, who are members of the Executive Committee, also receive compensation comprising a fixed portion, which is set in proportion to individual responsibilities, plus a variable portion, for which the\n\nquantitative criteria depend firstly on the financial performance of the entity they manage and secondly on the Group's results, with a view to strengthening solidarity and collegiality. The Chairmen are also evaluated using individual qualitative criteria.\n\nThe same performance indicators thus apply to the key players in the Group's business development, through the structure of and the method for evaluating the variable portion of their annual compensation.\n\nFor a number of years, all members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, have also been evaluated on the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects.\n\nTotal fixed compensation awarded to the members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, amounted to \u20ac7.9 million for FY22 (compared to \u20ac7.3 million for FY21). In addition to this, variable compensation (relating to FY21) of \u20ac8.3 million was paid (compared with \u20ac3.1 million paid in FY21). This significant change in variable compensation between the two financial years is due to the negative impact of the health crisis on the Group's financial results, i.e. the quantitative portion of variable compensation, which sharply reduced the amounts paid out in FY21 (relating to FY20). The amount paid during this financial year is similar to that of year N-2 (\u20ac7.1 million) and marks a return to a normal situation.",

This significant variation between the two\n\nfinancial years is due to the fact that the variable compensation portion was higher during the financial year, as well as the revaluation of the pension contribution rate of certain members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## Summary of transactions involving Pernod Ricard securities made 2.8.6 by corporate officers in FY22 (article 223-26 of the AMF General Regulation)\n\n| First name, surname, Company name           | Title            | Financial instrument                                     | Type of transaction                          | Date       |   Price (\u20ac) | Amount of transaction (\u20ac)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mr Alexandre Ricard                         | Chairman and CEO | Call option                                              | Exercise of stock options                    | 16.11.2021 |     126.53  | 2,091,920                   |\n| Mr C\u00e9sar Giron                              | Director         | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 10.11.2021 |       0     | 0                           |\n|                                             |                  | Call option                                              | Exercise of stock options                    | 03.01.2022 |     105.81  | 706,493                     |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Disposal                                     | 03.01.2022 |     210.226 | 1,403,682                   |\n| Ms Virginie Fauvel                          | Director         | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 30.11.2021 |     197.57  | 42,082                      |\n| Ms Namita Shah                              | Director         | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 23.11.2021 |     210.1   | 10,505                      |\n| Ms Kory Sorenson                            | Director         | Shares                                                   | Disposal                                     | 31.03.2022 |     222     | 210,900                     |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 31.03.2022 |     200.659 | 190,626                     |\n| Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard                         | Director         | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 01.07.2021 |     187.094 | 4,999,903                   |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 14.09.2021 |     189.146 | 5,980,043                   |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 14.09.2021 |     188.679 | 978,298                     |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 14.09.2021 |     188.414 | 577,299                     |\n|                                             |                  | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 14.09.2021 |     188.651 | 403,713                     |\n|                                             |                  | Transfer of stock put options                            | Transfer of stock put options                | 10.05.2022 |       4.02  | 499,810.62                  |\n| Le Delos Invest II SA,                      | Director         | Shares                                                   | Vesting                                      | 10.11.2021 |     209.353 | 259,597,720.00              |\n| legal entity linked to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard, |                  | Financial forward instrument with equities as underlying | Conclusion of a forward financial instrument | 10.11.2021 |       0     | 0.00                        |\n| Director                                    |                  | Shares                                                   | Pledge of shares                             | 10.11.2021 |       0     | 0.00                        |\n\n2.",

The maximum purchase price was set at \u20ac260 per share and the Company was not authorised to purchase any more than 10% of the shares making up the Company's share capital; additionally, the number of shares held by the Company could not, at any time, exceed 10% of the shares comprising the Company's share capital.\n\nFurthermore, the Combined General Meeting of 27 November 2020 authorised the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares under the same conditions and at a maximum purchase price set at \u20ac270 per share, for a period of 18 months. This authorisation cancelled the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of 8 November 2019 with effect from 27 November 2020, for the portion which remained unused.\n\nPursuant to these authorisations, the liquidity agreement compliant with the AMAFI Code of Ethics and entered into with Rothschild & Cie Banque with effect from 1 June 2012 was renewed on 1 June 2021 for a period of one year. The funds initially allocated to the liquidity account amount to \u20ac5,000,000.\n\nThe authorisation granted by the General Meeting of 10 November 2021, which remains in force at the date this document was filed, will expire on 9 May 2023. The General Meeting of 10 November 2022 will be called upon to authorise the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares under a new share buyback programme described below, under 'Details of the new programme to be submitted for authorisation to the Annual Ordinary General Meeting of 10 November 2022'.",

These securities were cancelled.\n\nPursuant to authorisations granted by the Combined General Meeting of 10 November 2021, the Board of Directors of the same date implemented a performance share allocation plan. As part of this, an option hedge was subscribed for 88,000 shares by acquiring the same number of three-year American call options. The Company also purchased 88,000 shares at the price of \u20ac212.90, as well as 160,000 shares through the exercise of American call options. The 160,000 Pernod Ricard SA shares resulting from the exercise of the American call options, which serve to cover the various plans, were sold off-market to an investment services provider at an average price of \u20ac137.78.\n\nA reallocation of shares acquired on the stock market in previous financial years to cover various stock option or performance share plans and the 88,000 American calls, enabling the same number of Pernod Ricard shares to be acquired, were allocated to cover part of these stock option and performance share allocation plans.\n\nIn addition, 512,183 shares were acquired on the stock market and allocated to cover an Employee Shareholding Plan.\n\nTreasury shares constitute reserves covering the various stock option and performance share allocation plans still in force. During the period, the following transfers were made within these reserves of treasury shares: 183,600 shares were allocated to beneficiaries of the performance share plan of 9 November 2017 (at the end of the four-year vesting period), 48,932 shares were transferred to cover the rights of beneficiaries who had exercised stock options, and 1,500 shares were transferred to cover early release events as provided for by law.\n\nUnder the liquidity agreement signed with Rothschild & Cie Banque, during the period, the Company:\n\n- purchased 110,668 shares for a total amount of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> \u20ac20,950,852; and\n- sold 110,668 shares for a total amount of \u20ac20,960,502.35. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Distribution of treasury shares by purpose on 30 June 2022\n\nTreasury shares are all allocated as reserves for different stock option and performance share allocation plans.",

Thus, in accordance with the law, the Company may not at any time hold a number of shares representing more than 10% of its share capital.\n\nAs the Company may not hold more than 10% of its share capital, and given that it held 979,454 shares ( i.e. 0.38% of the share capital) at the time of the last declaration relating to the number of shares and voting rights on 30 June 2022, the maximum number of shares that can be bought will be 24,815,281 ( i.e. 9.62% of the share capital), unless it sells or cancels shares it already holds.\n\nThe purpose of these share buybacks and the uses that may be made of the shares repurchased in this manner are described in detail in the 12 th resolution to be put to the vote of the shareholders on 10 November 2022. The share buyback programme would enable the Company to purchase the Company's shares or have them purchased for the purpose of:\n\n- allocating shares or transferring them to employees and/or (i) Executive Directors of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates under the terms and conditions provided for by law, in particular by granting stock options or as part of employee profit-sharing plans; or\n- covering its commitments pursuant to financial contracts (ii) or options with cash payments relating to positive changes in the stock market price of the Company's shares, granted to employees and/or Executive Directors of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates under the terms and conditions provided for by law; or\n- making free allocations of shares to employees and/or (iii) Executive Directors of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates, under the terms and conditions of articles L. 22-10-59 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, it being specified that the shares may be allocated, in particular, to an employee savings plan in accordance with the provisions of article L. 3332-14 of the French Labour Code; or\n- retaining them and subsequently tendering them (in (iv) exchange, as payment or otherwise) within the scope of external growth transactions, subject to the limit of 5% of the number of shares comprising the share capital; or\n- delivering shares upon the exercise of rights attached to (v) securities granting access to the share capital through reimbursement, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or in any other manner; or\n- cancelling all or some of the shares repurchased in this (vi) manner, under the conditions provided for in\n\narticle L. 22-10-62 paragraph 4 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with the authorisation to reduce the share capital granted by the Combined General Meeting of 10 November 2021 in its 14 th resolution valid until 9 January 2024; or\n\n- allowing an investment services provider to act on the (vii) secondary market or to ensure liquidity of the Company's shares by means of liquidity agreements in compliance with the terms of a Code of Ethics approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).\n\nThis programme is also intended to enable the Company to trade in the Company's shares for any other authorised purpose or any purpose that might come to be authorised by law or regulations in force.\n\nThe number of Company shares purchased may be such that:\n\n- the Company does not purchase more than 10% of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> shares comprising the Company's share capital at any time during the term of the share buyback programme; this percentage applies to the share capital adjusted in accordance with capital transactions carried out after this General Meeting; in accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, when shares are repurchased to favour the liquidity of the share under the conditions set out by the applicable regulations, the number of shares taken into account for calculating the 10% cap is equal to the number of shares purchased, less the number of shares sold during the authorisation period; and\n- the number of shares held by the Company at any time does glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> not exceed 10% of the number of shares comprising its share capital.\n\nThese shares may be purchased, sold, transferred, delivered or exchanged, on one or more occasions, by any means authorised or that may come to be authorised by the regulations in force. These means include, in particular, over-the-counter transactions, sales of blocks of shares, sale and repurchase agreements and the use of any financial derivatives, traded on a regulated market or over-the-counter, or setting up option strategies (purchases and sales of puts and calls and any combinations thereof in compliance with the applicable regulations). Transactions involving blocks of shares may account for the entire share buyback programme.\n\nThese transactions may be carried out during periods considered appropriate by the Board of Directors. However, during a public offer period, the repurchases would only be carried out subject to the conditions that they:\n\n- enable the Company to comply with its prior commitments glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> undertaken before the launch of the public offering;\n- are undertaken in connection with the pursuit of a share glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> buyback programme that was already in progress;\n- fall within the scope of the objectives referred to in items glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (i) to (iii) above; and\n- cannot cause the offer to fail. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe Board of Directors may also carry out, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, the reassignment to another objective of shares previously bought back (including under a previous authorisation) and their disposal (on- or off-market).\n\nThis authorisation would be valid for a period of 18 months from the General Meeting of 10 November 2022 and would cancel, as from this same date, for any unused portion, the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares by the Combined General Meeting of 10 November 2021 in its 12 th resolution.\n\n2.",

This mechanism is described in Subsection 2.12.3 'Voting conditions' below.\n\nIn addition, certain shares of the Company have double voting rights as described in Subsection 2.12.3 'Voting conditions' below.\n\n## Agreements between 2.11.3 shareholders of which the Company is aware\n\nThe Shareholders' agreement between shareholders of the Company (agreement between Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard, owned by the Ricard family) is described under 'Shareholders' agreements' in Subsection 2.5.8 'Declaration of Directors' of this universal registration document and also appears on the AMF website (www.amf-france.org).\n\n## Agreements entered into 2.11.4 by the Company which are modified or become void as a result of a change of control of the Company\n\nUnder certain conditions, the Company's financing agreements provide for the early repayment of its debts. The description of the change of control clauses of these contracts is given under Subsection 5.6 'Material contracts' in Section 5 'Management report' of this universal registration document.\n\n## Other items 2.11.5\n\nThe Company's articles of association (2) are amended in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions in France.\n\nThere is no specific agreement providing for indemnities in the event of the termination of the position of Directors, with the exception of the commitments to the Executive Director described in Subsection 2.8.2 'Compensation policy for the Chairman and CEO', in the 'Policy on deferred commitments' paragraph.\n\n## General Meetings and attendance procedures 2.12\n\nIt is reminded that article 32 of the articles of association (1) sets out the procedures that shareholders must follow in order to attend General Meetings.\n\nThe shareholders meet every year at a General Meeting.\n\n## Notice to attend meetings 2.12.1\n\nBoth Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meetings are called, held and voted in accordance with the conditions provided for by law. They are held at the Company's registered office or at any other place stated in the notice of meeting.\n\nDecisions by the shareholders are taken at Ordinary, Extraordinary or Combined General Meetings depending on the nature of the resolutions they are being asked to adopt.\n\n## Participation in General 2.12.2 Meetings\n\nAll shareholders have the right to attend the Company's General Meetings and to participate in the deliberations, either in person or by proxy, regardless of the number of shares they hold. In order for a shareholder to have the right to participate in Ordinary or Extraordinary General Meetings, the shares must be registered in the name of the shareholder or in the name of the financial intermediary acting on the shareholder's behalf at 00.00 (Paris time) two business days prior to the General Meeting, either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by the authorised financial intermediary.\n\n(2)",

Any shareholder wishing to attend the General Meeting in person who has not received their admission card by 00.00 (Paris time) two business days before the General Meeting may also ask for such a certificate to be issued.\n\nIf a shareholder does not attend the General Meeting in person, he or she may choose one of the following options:\n\n- give a proxy to the Chairman of the General Meeting; or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- give a proxy to a spouse or partner with whom he or she has glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> entered into a civil union agreement, or to any other person; or\n- vote by post or via the Internet. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nA shareholder who has already cast a postal or Internet vote, sent in a proxy form or applied for an admission card or a share certificate may sell all or some of his or her shares at any time. However, if the disposal takes place before 00.00 (Paris time) on the second business day prior to the General Meeting, the Company will invalidate or modify accordingly, as appropriate, the postal or Internet vote cast, proxy form, admission card or share certificate. For this purpose, the authorised financial intermediary in charge of the shareholder's account will inform the Company or its duly authorised agent of the disposal and will provide it with the necessary information.\n\nNo disposal or other form of transaction carried out after 00.00 (Paris time) on the second business day prior to the General Meeting, regardless of the means used, will be notified by the authorised financial intermediary or taken into consideration by the Company, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the still uncertain situation with regard to the development of the Covid-19 epidemic, Pernod Ricard may have to change the attendance procedures for the General Meeting on 10 November 2022.\n\nWe would therefore ask you to regularly check the General Meeting section on the Pernod Ricard website, which will confirm the final arrangements for attending this General Meeting depending on the sanitary and/or legal requirements.\n\n## Voting conditions 2.12.3\n\nThe voting right attached to the shares is proportional to the share capital they represent. Each share grants the right to at least one vote (article L. 225-122 of the French Commercial Code).\n\n## Restriction on voting rights\n\nHowever, each member of the General Meeting has as many votes as shares he or she possesses and represents, up to 30% of the total voting rights.\n\n## Double voting rights\n\nA double voting right is granted to other shares (in light of the fraction of the authorised share capital they represent) to all fully paid-up shares that can be shown to have been registered for at least 10 years in the name of the same shareholder, from 12 May 1986 inclusive (article L. 22-10-46 of the French Commercial Code).\n\nIn the event of a share capital increase through the capitalisation of reserves, profits or share premiums, registered shares allocated as bonus shares to a shareholder, on the basis of existing shares for which he or she benefits from this right, will also have double voting rights as from their issuance (article L. 22-10-46 of the French Commercial Code).\n\nAny share loses the double voting right if converted into bearer shares or if its ownership is transferred. Nevertheless, transfer following the division of an estate or the liquidation of assets between spouses and inter vivos donation to a spouse or relation close enough to inherit will not result in the loss of the acquired right and will not interrupt the aforementioned 10-year period.\n\n## Declaration of statutory thresholds\n\nAny individual or corporate body acquiring a shareholding greater than 0.5% of the share capital must inform the Company of the total number of shares held by registered letter, with return receipt requested, within four trading days from the date on which this threshold is exceeded. This notification must be repeated, under the same conditions, each time the threshold is exceeded by an additional 0.5%, up to and including 4.5%.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with the notification obligation mentioned in the previous paragraph, shares in excess of the undeclared amount shall be stripped of their voting rights, at the request, as set forth in the minutes of the General Meeting, of one or more shareholders holding at least 5% of the share capital, for any General Meeting held until the expiry of the period stipulated in article L. 233-14 of the French Commercial Code following the date when the notification is made.\n\n## Modification of shareholders' 2.12.4 rights\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting has the power to modify shareholders' rights, under the conditions defined by law.\n\n2.",

Considerable effort has been made in recent years to ensure the quality and objectivity of the assessment. This resulted in the implementation three years ago of the 'Let's Talk Talent' assessment and calibration process powered by the Workday platform, deployed globally, and which ensures the greatest possible consistency in performance assessment, personal development and career advancement for all our employees.\n\nIn addition, in the wake of the global 'Better Balance' initiative conducted from 2017 to 2019 on the two main dimensions of the Group's diversity challenges (gender and nationality), the Senior Management and the Human Resources Department have been encouraged to identify measures specific to their own diversity challenges on at least these two dimensions and to make them objectives for the members of the affiliates' Management Committees. Moreover, objectives have been defined for the Group's Management bodies, identified as the 'Top 500' (1) employees, and a series of actions have been taken to help achieve these objectives (2) .\n\nIn 2019, Pernod Ricard's Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, established binding objectives within its CSR roadmap relating to diversity in the Group's management bodies: by 2030, the Group's management bodies will have to include a minimum of 40% of each gender. In addition, Pernod Ricard estimates that it will achieve a 30% gender balance in its management bodies by 2025.\n\nAll of the initiatives undertaken by Pernod Ricard in favour of diversity help to make all the processes that lead to the selection of candidates and their assignment to the highest positions of responsibility in the Company more equitable and have produced the following results over the recent period:\n\n- for the Executive Committee, the proportion of women glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> increased from 7% to 31.25% between 2015 and 2022; and\n- for the 'Top 500', the proportion of women rose from 19% to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 35% between 2015 and 2022.\n\nThis diversity policy and the results obtained are presented annually to the Board of Directors by Senior Management.\n\n2.",

Its founder Paul Ricard was an early philanthropist who created the Paul Ricard Oceanographic Institute in 1966 in response to the first industrial pollutions in the Mediterranean Sea. This commitment lives on today with the Group's 2030 S&R roadmap, \u00ab Good Times from a Good Place \u00bb launched in 2019.\n\nBuilt around four pillars - Nurturing Terroir, Valuing People, Circular Making and Responsible Hosting, the S&R roadmap addresses all the Group's activities from grain to glass. Pernod Ricard's S&R ambition sits at the heart of the Company's mission to \"unlock the magic of human connection by bringing Good Times from a Good Place\".\n\nFor Pernod Ricard, S&R is a key business driver and is proving an important lever to accelerate transformation, by driving innovation, building purposeful brands, attracting talents and bringing to life the vision of a more convivial world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pernod Ricard's Manifesto\n\n' Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9 : true to Pernod Ricard's founding spirit, the Group has been bringing people together since its beginning, inviting them to share privileged moments and forge new friendships every day through our world-class portfolio of premium wines and spirits.\n\nWe are passionate hosts \u2026 a family of exceptional people who are committed to fighting alcohol misuse and creating a better way of living and working together, bringing good times today and for generations to come.\n\nWe are respectful guests \u2026 who care for and strive to protect and nurture the terroirs and environments in which we live. We partner with local farmers and respect local communities to benefit our planet, our consumers and business.\n\nWe bring good times from a good place, to create a more convivial world, a world without excess.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Addressing all stakeholder 3.1.1.2 expectations, from grain to glass\n\nPernod Ricard's 2030 S&R roadmap addresses the material risks facing its business along with consumer concerns whilst using the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding beacon. The roadmap is built on four pillars:\n\n- nurturing terroir; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- valuing people; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- circular making; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- responsible hosting. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nSince 2018, the UN Global Compact has recognised Pernod Ricard as a LEAD participant for its contribution to the UN SDGs.\n\nEach pillar sets ambitious commitments based on a 2030 timeline in line with the SDGs, with 2022 and 2025 milestones. The strategy primarily contributes to eight SDGs, though it addresses 14 SDGs across the Group's entire value chain.\n\nThe S&R roadmap is the result of a long process of interviews and consultations with over 300 internal and external stakeholders globally and other experts. Over 20 workshops were held with representatives of Brand Companies, Market Companies, Regions, HQ and the Top Management team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group closely monitors its commitments, objectives and performance indicators. It reviews, challenges and adapts its strategy and related roadmap according to its progress and the surrounding context. This ensures long-term consistency between the Group's growing ambitions and its impact, while enabling new, more effective monitoring tailored to the expectations of the various stakeholders.",

This identifies specific responsibilities and clear reporting lines at each level, from affiliates right up to the Board of Directors' S&R Committee.\n\nAs of 1 July 2022, Conor McQuaid has been appointed to the Executive Board as EVP Corporate Communications, S&R and Public Affairs. This newly created role will strategically lead and bring together these three global functions.

        "page_content": "## The main sustainability risks and opportunities 3.2\n\nIn line with Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting as transposed into French law (1) , Pernod Ricard publishes a 'Non-Financial Statement'. This statement requires the Group to disclose its business model and information on key non-financial risks. These include risks related to the environment, employment, society, Human Rights, tax evasion (2) and corruption.\n\nFor more information on Pernod Ricard's business model, please see Section 1 'Extracts from the integrated annual report'.\n\nFor more information on the Group's key non-financial risks please see Subsections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 below.\n\n## Presentation of the methodology 3.2.1\n\nUpdated in FY21, the Group's risk mapping presents and classifies the risks based on their potential impact and probability of occurrence across the Group's activities (3) . Some of these risks are specific to sustainability. To ensure such risks and any opportunities are properly identified and mapped, Pernod Ricard uses the following methodology:\n\n- every three years, the main risks faced by Pernod Ricard are: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- mapped by direct affiliates and HQ functions, and 1.\n- then consolidated at HQ level by the Group's Internal Audit 2. Department;\n- the same Group risk mapping methodology and tool are used glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> to identify the main sustainability risks for the 'Non-Financial Statement';\n\nArticle R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code. (1)\n\n- See Subsection 3.1.1.2 'Addressing all stakeholder expectations, from grain to glass'. (4)\n\n- led by the S&R Department, these sustainability risks are glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> subject to in-depth analysis through research, competitive benchmarking and internal and external stakeholder dialogue (4) . The Group's materiality matrix was last updated in 2020. Other key HQ experts including operations, legal, HR, public affairs and finance were also involved in confirming the top eight risks and opportunities;\n- the identified sustainability risks and opportunities were then glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> cross-referenced with the 2021 Group Risk Mapping to confirm them and ensure consistency with the Group's major risks in Section 4;\n- the resulting eight non-financial risks and opportunities were glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> subsequently presented to and signed off by the S&R Senior Steering Committee and the Board of Directors' S&R Committee.\n\n## Key risks and opportunities 3.2.2\n\nAs any company, Pernod Ricard may be exposed to external or internal risks whilst also potentially benefitting from opportunities. It is thus essential to identify such potential risks and opportunities and ensure the roll-out of adequate action and/or mitigation plans.\n\nThe definitions of the eight main risks and opportunities can be found in the table below. Targets, policies, due diligence procedures and key performance indicators are presented in detail in sections 3.3 'The four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place roadmap' and 3.4 'Ethics and compliance'. In the interest of transparency, other indicators have been presented alongside the policies applied, depending on the issues addressed.\n\nGiven the nature of Pernod Ricard's activities, the Group does not consider 'tax evasion (5) ' to be a major non-financial risk. It was therefore not felt necessary to explore it in this 'Non-Financial Statement'. Nevertheless, 'tax evasion' is discussed in Subsection 3.4.1.5 'Tax policy'.",

The Group is committed to nurturing every terroir and its biodiversity and respond to the challenges of climate change to ensure quality ingredients now and for generations to come.\n\nThe Group has been working hand in hand with its farmers, suppliers and communities to develop sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices in its terroirs, including its own vineyards, in order to:\n\n- protect ecosystems, enhance biodiversity and natural capital glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (wild or cultivated) by preserving habitats and trophic chains;\n- tackle climate change, by reducing its greenhouse gas glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> emissions and exploring potential carbon sinks within its agricultural chains. This also involves adapting its crops and agricultural practices;\n- support agricultural communities and smallholders, in order glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> to:\n- develop sustainable practices, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- improve livelihoods, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- increase access to health and education, and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- more broadly, empower local populations. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Supporting communities to regenerate 3.3.1.1 ecosystems and tackle climate change\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nThe Group's core business is inextricably linked to well-functioning ecosystems. Any disruption to one component (soil, water, climate, landscape\u2026) has a direct impact on natural balances. Pernod Ricard therefore pays close attention to each element to better understand the mechanisms at work and restore natural balances.\n\nThe Group believes in the strength of a holistic and systemic approach to agriculture that covers the entire farming system, maximises the shared benefits and, ultimately, the overall resilience of the terroirs over the long term. The objectives include:\n\n- maximising positive interactions between agricultural and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> wild ecosystems;\n- paying particular attention to soil life and its ability to restore glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> carbon cycles;\n- reducing dependency on agrochemicals; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- sustainably managing water resources; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- looking after those who work the land. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe Group believes that regenerative agriculture is a significant part of the solution. This holistic approach aims to enrich soil life and its natural fertility, improve water retention capacity, and protect and enhance biodiversity.\n\nOver the long run, regenerative agriculture will improve the vitality of plants, whilst maximising carbon storage in the soil, ensuring high-quality harvests and yield stabilisation.",

(2)\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\n## Certification\n\nPernod Ricard aims to certify all its key raw materials to recognised sustainability standards. The Group has developed a benchmarking tool to help select the best standards, in line with the Sustainable Agriculture Key Principles. The Group also allows affiliates to develop their own standards with their local partners. All must then be verified by third parties.\n\nThe standards are chosen to cover most of the high and medium risks identified through the terroir risk mapping. For example, given the risk profiles of the various sugar cane terroirs, the Bonsucro certification has been identified as the most suitable. It will be rolled out to all suppliers.\n\nThis approach was designed to be tailored to each terroir by factoring in local cultures, work habits as well as the potential for transforming practices.\n\n## Risk mitigation projects\n\nFor terroirs which have demonstrated a high-level of risk, Pernod Ricard develops actions to mitigate these risks. This can be achieved through implementing certifications, engaging in specific local programs or, if needed, rethinking the sourcing strategy.\n\n## Focus on water use in the vineyards\n\nPernod Ricard sources grapes from 17 wine-growing countries, seven of which have vineyards directly operated by the Group.\n\nAs perennial crops, vineyards are particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change and in particular droughts, fires or even frost. The trend towards the increasing frequency and severity of such events has been confirmed over the past three years in the Group's vineyards. Despite the use of precision farming tools like drip irrigation systems, a significant increase in water consumption has been observed during the last years. It amounted to 11.5 million m 3 this year. Improving the resilience of vines to water scarcity will be at the heart of pilot programmes on regenerative viticulture.\n\n3.",

For example, transitioning to regenerative practices for large industrial corn farmers in the US will require different supports and milestones compared with the transition for small Indian rice farmers.\n\nThe programmes aim to better understand and factor in local contexts, measure the dynamics of natural cycles, train partners in regenerative practices and design continuous improvement plans over the long term.\n\nTo support this journey on priority terroirs, Pernod Ricard decided to join the French PADV ( Pour une Agriculture Du Vivant ) movement. Using its regeneration index, the Group measured the starting point of its partner farms and then put in place drivers to improve the resilience of the terroirs.\n\nIn 2021, the Group became the first corporate partner of the IUCN (1) 'Agriculture and Land Health initiative', which aims to build a global movement for sustainable and regenerative agriculture and create metrics to monitor progress. Pernod Ricard was the first corporate company to join the initiative, which aims to bring together businesses, experts, academia and international organisations.\n\nFor its own vineyards, the Group has committed to run regenerative viticulture pilot programmes. Following a comprehensive diagnosis of the two French terroirs, Martell cognac and Mumm and Perrier-Jou\u00ebt champagnes set up a pilot programme to explore three main areas: soil life; plant health and nutrition; and landscape management.\n\nVarious trials are run to test combinations of cover-crops, develop grape varieties resistant to climate constraints, or even implement specific technologies or machinery.\n\nIn the south of France, where Irish Distillers source their maize, the Group has enrolled 27 farmers in the regenerative index to identify their areas of progress and transform their practices, such as no or low tillage. As part of this project, the Group is also working to develop a fair economic model to ensure long-term mutual commitments.\n\nIn India, Pernod Ricard India Foundation's flagship programme WAL (Water, Agriculture, Livelihoods) aims to foster water resilience, promote sustainable and regenerative resource management, while securing the livelihoods of disadvantaged communities such as smallholder farmers, women and young people.\n\nIn Mexico, Kahl\u00faa works with coffee-producing communities and local NGO Fondo Para La Paz to support agricultural practices like the planting and development of climate resistant varieties as well as fair compensation, with a specific focus on female empowerment.",

This means:\n\n## Talent management 3.3.2.1\n\nTalent management is and will remain a key strategic priority.\n\nPernod Ricard's people strategy is based on the Group's Leadership Attributes.

In progress |\n\n## Objectives & Policies\n\nThe Leadership Attributes represent the leadership behaviours Pernod Ricard needs to ensure its future success. They are embedded in its global Human Resources strategy through the annual performance appraisals, 360 feedback process, assessment centres and leadership development programmes. All these processes and programmes help Pernod Ricard's employees grow their leadership skills and be better prepared to master challenges and drive change to deliver its business goals.\n\nThe Group-wide HR strategy TransfoHRm is powered by a single Group-wide global digital platform, Workday. This sets the goal of making 'Convivialit\u00e9' a true performance driver by:\n\n- putting the employee experience centre stage; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- recruiting diverse teams to improve individual and collective glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> performance; and\n- introducing a performance and success culture built around glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> ownership and accountability, supported by digital tools.\n\nIn the past year, Pernod Ricard has continued running 360 feedbacks to continue developing its leaders, promote the Leadership Attributes and further embed them across all affiliates. In FY22, 188 employees participated in the 360 feedback assessments with an overall satisfaction rate of 98%.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\n## HRmanagement system: Workday\n\nThe Group introduced and started benefiting from the new employee-centric tool, Workday, three years ago. This has been very successful in helping manage the key group HR processes. Pernod Ricard has been able to quantify the return on investment:\n\n- having streamlined business processes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- established a common language; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- created unified and reliable information worldwide. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- It has significantly improved HR efficiency, facilitating decision-making so as to put the right talent in the right positions with the right skills at the right time in their career. Employees and their managers now have a robust and reliable tool to access information about their position, career path, compensation and evaluation any time, any place. Employees are fully empowered to promote themselves and be proactive with their career development.\n\nWith the experience built up since Workday's launch and the improved efficiency, Pernod Ricard is now committed to introducing additional functionality to support the ongoing improvement of the employee experience. This will help improve interaction and dialogue between employees, managers and HR teams. The Group has continued to analyse and regularly revisit what has been accomplished using agile ways of working.\n\n- increasing employee loyalty and engagement; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- lowering supply chain risks; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- meeting rising consumer expectations around transparency. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nDue to the seasonal nature of its activities, especially during harvest periods, 5.3% of the annual average headcount is on fixed-term contracts. Rather than using contractors, Pernod Ricard prefers to hire this temporary workforce so that they can also benefit from its development and health & safety policies.\n\n3.",

        "page_content": "The four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place roadmap\n\nThe Group has continued to leverage technology for more transparency, planning and forecasting accuracy within HR. This was achieved in a very agile and collaborative manner through the ongoing improvement of the Adaptive Insight module in Workday. A strategic project for Pernod Ricard, launched simultaneously across all Group affiliates, it allows HR to forecast, plan and manage employee-related costs as these represent the largest overhead.\n\nWith an eye on the importance of adopting, embedding and achieving proficiency in new ways of working, in FY22, Pernod Ricard continued to consistently enhance process efficiency and HR capability through a new operating model for the HR Transformation team and a change management plan involving extensive upskilling. This was delivered through various trainings, toolkits and Q&A sessions. These ambitious initiatives will ensure that HR effectively embeds the new ways of working and pro-actively partners and supports managers & employees to co-create their unique experience at Pernod Ricard.\n\n## 'Let's Talk Talent': a global talent management approach shared across all affiliates thanks to a common language to assess performance and potential\n\nThe engagement and performance of Pernod Ricard's employees continue to be the foundation of the Company's success. It is important not only to look at the 'what' has been achieved, but also to assess the 'how', especially in relation to the previously mentioned Leadership Attributes.\n\nThe 'Let's Talk Talent' process looks at both factors (What and How) in the annual performance review, assigning each a 50% weighting. Pernod Ricard employees are evaluated not only on what they have accomplished, but also on how they have accomplished it through their Leadership Attributes.\n\nLet's Talk Talent is designed to create a systematic process that is comprehensive, fair and developmental. It enables Pernod Ricard to assess, provide feedback and develop teams, identifying the skills and competencies that are needed to support the strategic plans whilst fostering a diverse, high-performing culture. This process, along with the learning agility assessment of individual growth potential, forms the basis for identifying and developing talent within the Company for career development and succession planning.\n\nAs part of this Let's Talk Talent process, the Company fosters a culture of continuous feedback between supervisors and employees. It also supports People development within an environment in which everyone is accountable for their professional development (with the support of managers and the business). Pernod Ricard offers employees opportunities and resources to grow and empowers them to take steps to advance their careers and development within the business.\n\nFurthermore, this feedback culture is reinforced through the various assessment and development programmes Pernod Ricard offers: 360 feedback surveys, assessment centres, leadership programmes and mentoring.\n\n## Pernod Ricard University\n\nPernod Ricard University actively partners with the business and HR Departments to:\n\n- identify Learning & Development (L&D) needs; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- design programmes with high-end institutions, consultants glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and internal experts.\n\nOver the past two years, despite all the challenges surrounding Covid-19, the Group remained committed to growing talent by building up and refining the necessary functional skills. The current learning offering is based on a mix of formats approximately 80% online and hybrid, and 20% in-person. This new mix helps the Group to enhance its own strategic delivery through:\n\n- adequate response to the demand for more customisation, 1. accessibility & convenience using an anytime anywhere approach;\n- breadth and depth of the offering to address the varying 2. needs across the organisation, functions and locations, and the life stage and growth aspirations of individual employees;\n- delivery of more sustainable Learning & Development 3. experiences with a reduction in L&D-related CO2 emissions;\n- inclusive and purposeful development opportunities to help 4. all employees keep up with the changing world, technology advancement and generational differences.\n\nPernod Ricard's learning offering is built around co-creation, blended learning, dynamic sessions using a 70/20/10 approach to upskill employees. 91% received some training this year. In the post-Covid environment Pernod Ricard reopened its historical Domaine de La Voisine near Paris. Acquired by Paul Ricard in 1957, it was transformed into a state-of-the-art campus in 2017. The site is once again fully operational and is welcoming learners from both Pernod Ricard and other leading companies. Internal and external participants experience sharing and new discoveries with colleagues from a host of backgrounds and cultures worldwide.\n\nTrue to its 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de Convivialit\u00e9' vision, Pernod Ricard creates special moments for all learners, moments that enrich them both on a professional and personal level. In this way, the Group shares its values and culture of \"Convivialit\u00e9\", creating a special bond for the entire community.\n\nIn 2022, the key focus was on:\n\n- Massive upskilling in the Digital sphere with D-Passport 1. Season 2: This is a Group-wide programme designed to:\n- increase digital knowledge and skills; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- make work processes more agile; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- lay the foundations for more 'phygitally' attuned business glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> processes and customer interactions.",

        "page_content": "The programme continues to primarily focus on digital upskilling of the Marketing, Commercial and Leadership teams, but is available to all Group employees. 5,898 employees received fully online training, built around customised learning paths. This included a whole series of micro-learnings, webinars, external speakers, quizzes and tests.\n\n- Recovery and enhancement of Leadership Programmes: 2. Pernod Ricard's tailored 'Mixers' and 'Shakers' programmes re-started in spring 2022. In addition, the first pilot of the 'Role of the Finance Leader of the Future' was successfully delivered. Determined to increase customisation, the Leadership offering was expanded with a selection of online and in-person leadership development programmes from top executive education institutions and platforms like Exec Online. And broader coaching support was provided to global talent via two coaching platforms Better Up in North America and CoachHub for the rest of the world.\n- Acceleration of self-learning and continuous development: 3. To support the continuous growth of Group employees through new knowledge, skills acquisition, gratifying learner experience, and in a truly inclusive manner, Pernod Ricard granted all employees free access to the Coursera platform. This made over 7,000 programmes, specialisations and guided workshops available anytime, anywhere. It allows individual learners to take control of their own development and growth. In the first nine months, there were 4,766 sign-ups to 1,127 different courses, representing approximately 12,410 learning hours.\n- Enhancement of functional capabilities: This was achieved 4. through the effective delivery of iGrow programmes in online and hybrid formats. This ensured that Group talent could continue growing with no risk to their health and well-being and still experience the precious moments of sharing, cross-fertilisation and community through the increased interaction offered by hybrid formats. iGrow programmes were initially rolled out to the Marketing and Commercial teams and continued with the strong delivery of iGrow Finance and the ambitious upskilling in Operations.\n\nThe flexible iGrow approach allowed Pernod Ricard to embed continuous learning, ensuring that employees get the right skills at the right proficiency level in a dynamically evolving environment. This year, functional skills enhancement through instructor-led sessions benefited 7,687 employees across different functions, positions and locations, and 3,559 learners also utilised existing functional e-learnings.\n\nActing as true growth catalysts, the Group's holistic offering and L&D customisation efforts effectively contribute to the transformation of the organisation into a more agile, digitally savvy, innovative and consumer centric one, led by future-fit leaders and capable and engaged employees.\n\n## Leadership Assessment and Development programmes\n\nThe Group has developed a full range of leadership assessment and development programmes in response to Pernod Ricard's business goals and to better prepare top executives in terms of succession and career planning. In 2022, 71 participants took part in 'Blenders', a global assessment and development programme for Top Management to assess them against the Group's Leadership Model and help with their career development. The main objectives are to create space for leaders to reflect and then put in place tailored development plans to enhance their growth and development as leaders.\n\nThe Group has also established global leadership assessment and development centres ('LeAD UP') via an external provider. This helps assess skills and leadership potential, identify strengths and development opportunities, develop people with high potential and better prepare them for future leadership roles. The goal is to encourage all employees to take ownership of their careers. The 'LeAD UP' programme offers two-day sessions in which participants conduct one-on-one interviews, tests and case studies. They also receive in-depth feedback and participate in workshops. In FY22, over 115 participants took part in these development programmes with over 60% of participants being female. This helps better support them with their career development at Pernod Ricard as part of its efforts to accelerate the D&I agenda and female talent development.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n| Number and %                                                                        | FY21    | FY22    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| % of the payroll invested by the Group in training                                  | 1.5%    | 1.5%    |\n| Number of employees trained (1)                                                     | 17,636  | 17,103  |\n| % of total workforce trained (1)                                                    | 98%     | 91%     |\n| Training hours (1)                                                                  | 378,082 | 423,129 |\n| Average number of hours of training received by training beneficiaries (1) per year | 21      | 25      |\n| % of employees who received at least one performance review (2)                     | 91%     | 91%     |\n| Number of employees who participated in the LeAD UP programme (2)                   | 157     | 115     |\n\n- Permanent contracts.

Pernod Ricard believes in an inclusive culture where everyone is valued for who they truly are, and where their experiences, perspectives and uniqueness drive collective performance.\n\nFrom a gender diversity perspective, since 2015 the Group has increased the percentage of women in top management from 19% to 35% Furthermore, 45% of managerial positions are held by women.\n\nThe Group continues to focus on gender parity. The Group is implementing internal development programmes and processes to increase the representation of women, in line with the S&R roadmap for 2030. The D&I strategy is also firmly embedded in the annual global strategic talent review process and succession planning at senior executive level. These processes focus on identifying and preparing the talent pipeline and continue to help develop female talent.\n\nOver the past year, Pernod Ricard has also launched a Senior D&I Council comprising diverse senior executive leaders globally. This senior leadership group has worked on the development of a new global D&I strategic framework. This will be rolled out in the new financial year and will allow all market and Brand Companies to come into alignment from a D&I perspective. The goal is to further support and drive D&I and empower all affiliates with appropriate guidance and toolkits.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nIn addition to this global framework and priorities, management at the local affiliates have established their own D&I agendas and plans aligned with their local markets and business needs.\n\nThe 'TransfoHRm' HR Strategy announced in 2018 is inherently a diversity-centric strategy. TransfoHRm is about ensuring that key processes such as talent development and management are\n\nfair and equitable. Let's Talk Talent is a consistent process based on an objective assessment of performance and potential, with a common language and methodology across all affiliates. This offers all employees an equal opportunity for a successful and fulfilling career at Pernod Ricard. Because the 'How' of performance is as important as the 'What', managers and HR are also supported and trained in performance evaluation and calibration. The process is designed to overcome the traditional pitfalls of talent management and make Pernod Ricard more open to diversity and inclusion thanks to objective and fair global processes.\n\nThe Group has also become more visible in the diversity sphere through its active participation in the main event at the last four Women's Forums in Paris (20 participants and sponsorship of the event).\n\nIn terms of gender pay equity, the Group has completed the third global analysis in partnership with an independent specialist. This global initiative involved an audit of over 70 countries. The objective is to identify the behavioural drivers and roots of gender pay gaps to ensure strict pay equity across the Group through a long-term systematic compensation review. Results for FY22 show great progress with a 0.9% gap worldwide. External providers consider a pay gap below 1% to be essentially zero and in line with best practice. This result has been achieved through the implementation of gender pay equity initiatives by all affiliates of the Group. The strategy has consisted in adjusting the lowest salaries (negative outliers) to achieve a reduction in pay gap globally. But more than just adjusting remuneration, affiliates have also included in their Gender Pay Equity strategy, other actions including: hiring policies, promotion & retention strategies, employee assessment and development, pay for performance linkage, review of any bias in their talent management and performance management process.",

        "page_content": "From a generational diversity perspective, the Group is committed to attracting and hiring young people on various contracts (apprenticeships, training, etc.). The Group also recruits and develops young graduates through VIE (international volunteers in industry) and international young graduate programmes. These include the Jameson International Graduate Programme, the Pernod Ricard Asia Regional Management Trainee Programme and the Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Ambassadors Programme. In addition, Pernod Ricard University and Global Talent Management support the work of the Youth Action Council (YAC) (1) .\n\nIn terms of disability, affiliates comply with local laws. Efforts are also made to make work environments friendlier to workers with disabilities. For example:\n\n- adapting premises and investing in appropriate equipment; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- providing training; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- raising employee awareness; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- conducting joint projects with specialised establishments; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- participating in dedicated forums; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- recruiting workers with disabilities. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn 2003, Pernod Ricard also signed up to the Business Workplace Diversity Charter. This aims to encourage the employment of people from across French society. This Charter bans all forms of discrimination in recruitment, training and professional development.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n## Representation of women at 30 June (permanent contracts)\n\n| Number and %    | FY21        | FY22        |\n|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Group employees | 6,592 (38%) | 7,088 (39%) |\n| Non-managers    | 3,656 (35%) | 3,767 (35%) |\n| Managers        | 2,936 (43%) | 3,321 (45%) |\n| Top management  | 136 (29%)   | 194 (35%)   |\n\nThis breakdown reflects the Group's strong presence in countries where the labour market is male-dominated. For example, in India men account for over 84% of the workforce. Amongst managers, the proportion of women has been constantly rising over the last decade: from 30% in FY12 to 45% in FY22.\n\n## Breakdown of positions with permanent contracts filled by women\n\n| Number and %       | FY21      | FY22        |\n|--------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Internal transfers | 657 (45%) | 208 (39%)   |\n| External hires     | 817 (46%) | 1,480 (48%) |\n\n## Employee engagement & culture, working conditions and health & safety 3.3.2.3\n\n## Employee engagement & culture\n\nSince the Group started measuring Global employee engagement through 'I Say', it has had a very high level of employee engagement.\n\nThe Global Employee Engagement Survey, 'I Say 2.0,' was reinvigorated in 2021 leveraging digital and data in partnership with Glint and moving to an annual global survey. Pernod Ricard will be rolling out the 7 th edition of 'I Say 2.0' in Autumn 2022. This revised survey empowers managers and HR to leverage advanced analytics and insights to better understand employee needs. It also allows them to more quickly roll out action plans\n\nto address the improvement areas identified. I Say 2.0 has been improved this year with a streamlined structure that is supported by a digital platform that managers and HR are able to access and extract results. This allows for targeted action plans. The results can then be benchmarked against engagement data from external organisations.\n\nAdditionally in 2022, Pernod Ricard conducted a separate global well-being survey on top of the now annual engagement survey to measure corresponding employee well-being indicators.\n\n| Number and %                                 | FY22   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| % of employees completing the 'I Say' Survey | 86%    |\n| Engagement score ('I Say')                   | 76*    |\n\n3.",

Each affiliate manages its policy locally while upholding a set of common rules. These include developing a performance culture and offering compensation that is competitive locally, leveraging external benchmarking and compensation data. This also involves setting up straightforward, meaningful and motivating compensation packages.\n\nTotal payroll is discussed in Note 3.5 \"Expenses by type\" in Section 6 'Consolidated financial statements' . This year, payroll accounted for 12.8% of net sales.\n\n## Signing of labour agreements\n\nThe affiliates sign roughly 170 agreements annually with a range of social partners worldwide. This encourages improved social dialogue. The number of agreements signed reflects changes in local legislation.\n\nThe agreements signed by affiliates during the past year mainly covered:\n\n- compensation and profit-sharing; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Group welfare schemes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- remote working; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- occupational health and safety. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Performance culture: employee profit-sharing policies\n\nPerformance is encouraged through favourable profit-sharing and incentive policies. A gross amount of \u20ac42 million was paid under such plans to over 5,335 employees, to which contributions (1) of over \u20ac7 million were added. Moreover, long-term profit-sharing policies (such as allocating performance-based shares or restricted shares for example) were once again implemented in FY21 for over 750 employees worldwide.\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched its first ever Employee Share Ownership Plan called 'Accelerate'. The second such Plan was rolled out in 2022 in 24 markets (including seven new markets), covering around 80% of Group employees. The initiative once again proved highly successful, with an overall sign-up rate of 45.7% ( versus 41.5% for the first plan). The sign-up rate was over 60% in several markets including India (76.7%), Hong Kong (66.1%) and Taiwan (60.4%). In France, the sign-up rate was 64.9% ( versus 56.9% in 2019).\n\nIn 2021, the Group launched Pay for Performance directly linking reward and recognition to performance. This will help build a high-performance culture across the organisation, allowing managers to differentiate the reward and recognition received by their teams based on their contribution and performance both on the \"What\" and the \"How\".\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\n## Welfare protection and health insurance\n\nIn line with the Group's commitment, all employees are offered a welfare protection plan covering major risks (death and invalidity). Some choose not to be covered or are covered by their spouse's employer.\n\n## Social dialogue\n\nThe Group has a long tradition of social dialogue and promotes freedom of association in every country in which it operates. In addition, it firmly believes in the importance of providing a working environment with optimal working conditions:\n\n- EU Works Council : with over 50% of its staff based in the EU, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the Group has mainly focused its efforts on EU employee representatives, through the EU Works Council. This council brings together one or more representatives from every affiliate within the EU with over 50 people. It had a total of 24 representatives in FY22.\n\nThe EU Works Council meets at least once a year. A Select Committee, elected by their peers, of five members from five different countries, meets at least once a year. The Select Committee may act on its own initiative in response to any social measure that might be taken within the EU involving at least two countries in which Pernod Ricard has local teams.\n\nTo share information, an intranet publishes content annually co-written by delegates and the HR Department.\n\nThe France Group Committee meets once a year. It brings together employee representatives appointed by the largest trade unions in the French affiliates. The purpose of this meeting is to review the Group's business activities, together with an analysis of employment trends and forecast changes for the year ahead.\n\nThe Group Committee and the EU Works Council are chaired by the Group Chairman & CEO, Alexandre Ricard, and moderated by the HR Department.",

The Group Human Resources EVP oversees the implementation of the Group's health and safety policy. The management of the local subsidiaries is responsible for its implementation.\n\n## Actions plans and next steps\n\nDelivering on this vision requires management systems. In that respect, the Group's production sites are required to be OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certified. In addition, Pernod Ricard is committed to and actively fosters a health & safety culture in\n\nwhich everyone is involved in taking care of each other through a culture of interdependence.\n\nTo drive this change, third party audits on safety culture and performance are being rolled out across the major production sites. Each audit gives rise to:\n\n- an assessment of the maturity of the site; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- an action plan to move to the next level on the maturity scale. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe Pernod Ricard training programme 'Care by Learning' continues to be rolled out through a pre-defined sequence of modules. Over one hundred Safety Champions from the affiliates are on a train-the-trainer programme. In terms of high-risk activity, there was a strong focus in FY22 on machinery safety to reduce accidents involving machines. All affiliates with production activities have implemented prevention measures following an assessment of their local practices.\n\nThe 'Key Health & Safety Principles' operational requirement published in FY21 for the non-industrial affiliates continued to serve as a self-assessment to satisfy minimum requirements of action plans.\n\nAnother key action launched in FY22 was the Pernod Ricard 'Duty of Care' e-learning. All Pernod Ricard employees have to complete the Health and Safety e-learning programme. The aim is to deepen the H&S culture, through engagement, motivation and empowerment.\n\n3.",

It is divided into three key areas:\n\n- 'in our own operations'; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 'in the supply chain'; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 'in our local communities'. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nSince FY19, the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct and the Supplier Standards have included such commitments.\n\nThe Group EVP Human Resources oversees the implementation of the Group's Human Rights Policy. HR Directors and Managing Directors at local level are responsible for implementing the Pernod Ricard Global Human Rights Policy.\n\nAs a decentralised organisation, Pernod Ricard hands responsibility for adopting, respecting and promoting the policy to its affiliates. Visits to affiliates by cross-functional internal audit teams include some labour evaluation. The performance evaluations of Managing Directors cover labour matters together with societal and financial performance. Any targets are specific to each affiliate.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nFrom FY18 to FY22, Pernod Ricard contributed to the UN Global Compact's Decent Work in Global Supply Chains Action platform. This is an alliance of companies committed to respecting Human Rights and fundamental principles and rights at work. This involved working through their supply chains and taking collective action to address decent work.\n\nNote: all these actions cover both Pernod Ricard employees and contractors under direct supervision.\n\nAs a result of this global effort, since 2019, the accident frequency rate was reduced by more than 50%. This is a significant achievement in line with the objective in the Health & Safety roadmap.",

This reflects its Human Rights policy and was focused on its own employees and internal practices. In addition, there was independent country-level screening and mapping of potential Human Rights risks.

It is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin;\n\nOverall, the findings demonstrated the implementation of a number of best practices. The findings also pointed to the need for increased communication and best practice sharing of the Health & Safety and Diversity & Inclusion efforts and roadmaps, and better dissemination of the Group's Human Rights policy and whistleblowing tool, Speak-Up. In FY22, the Group developed and promoted a video on Human Rights and the different Group tools and topics associated to raise employee awareness.\n\nThe top priorities identified by affiliates were Health & Safety, Discrimination and Diversity & Inclusion.\n\nThis demonstrated alignment with the Group's growing efforts in developing roadmaps in these areas (2) .

The aim is to increase awareness around:\n- Human Rights and labour law; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- health & safety; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- environmental impact; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- responsible drinking; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- integrity and fair business practices. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThis document was updated in 2019 and includes commitments pertaining to 'respecting land and water rights of communities', 'environmental regulations', 'animal welfare', and 'tax evasion'.\n\nMoreover, the Group took the opportunity to raise awareness amongst suppliers and encourage them to do likewise. Pernod Ricard will suspend dealings with any direct suppliers (Wet and Dry Goods) and key indirect suppliers (POS/VAPs) who fails to sign the updated version.\n\n- Risk mapping tool for each affiliate to identify which suppliers glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (Wet and Dry Goods, POS/VAPs) and subcontractors should be assessed first according to set criteria regarding:\n- production or service; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- size; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- country footprint; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- net sales; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- dependence of the supplier on the affiliate; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- annual expenditure; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- critical nature of the product; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- social, environmental and supply chain risks of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> supplier.\n- Sustainability assessment using the EcoVadis platform glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> around four key topics: environment, labour, ethics and supply chain.\n- Pernod Ricard asks for an annual reassessment of its high-risk suppliers and every two years for its medium-risk suppliers. This is in order to identify areas for improvement and review the effectiveness of their action plans.\n- Social and ethical audit standards in line with the SMETA glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) standards and any other similar audits covering the same criteria of analysis.\n\nFor this Blue Source analysis, Pernod Ricard assumes that the risk does not stop at the amount of the expense: due to its activity and location, a supplier with a low expense may be just as much at risk as a supplier with a high expense. Accordingly, expense coverage is not calculated in this analysis.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n| Number of suppliers                                                                                                                                             | FY21   | FY22   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Having signed the Supplier Standards (1)                                                                                                                        | 1,719  | 2,049  |\n| Analysed using the risk mapping tool                                                                                                                            | 1,900  | 2,304  |\n| Identified as risky (high or medium risk)                                                                                                                       | 1,351  | 1,852  |\n| Identified as risky and covered by an EcoVadis assessment                                                                                                       | 220    | 318    |\n| Identified as at risk with production sites covered by an audit in accordance with social, environmental and ethical standards                                  | 108    | 70     |\n| Identified as at risk following the results of the assessment/audit (EcoVadis, SMETA) but not having started the implementation of the required mitigation plan | N/A    | 56     |\n\nAs far as employee commitment is concerned, Pernod Ricard makes a number of training documents available to employees on the Group's Responsible Procurement process. These also indicate what actions employees can take to mitigate risks with their suppliers.\n\nFor example, Pernod Ricard offers an online learning module covering all fundamental aspects of sustainability and responsibility applied to Procurement which includes interactive explanations of what \"buying responsibly\" means, why it is an important topic for the Group and how the\n\nemployees can practice responsible procurement locally. In addition, other trainings are offered in various formats throughout the year, including individual calls with procurement teams, specific workshops and seminars.\n\nThe Group will take the following steps:\n\n- ask all suppliers, across all categories, to sign up to the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Supplier Standards on Partner Up (1) ;\n- complete an analysis of direct suppliers (Dry and Wet Goods) glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and key indirect suppliers (POS/VAPs) (2) ;",

It aims to enhance the procurement-related risk management and the value creation on S&R that the programme can bring. This project is divided in two phases:\n\n- a diagnostic with the objective to understand the program 1. maturity, challenge the existing model and get best practices and recommendations adapted to Pernod Ricard organisation;\n- a preparation phase to implement the new Pernod Ricard 2. Responsible Procurement model in FY23.\n\nThe Amazone project aspires to transform Pernod Ricard Responsible Procurement model in terms of scope, methods, technology used and resources involved.\n\n## The Bar World of Tomorrow 3.3.2.6\n\nThe hospitality sector, just like other sectors, has a role to play in the transition to a more sustainable and responsible world. To guide bartenders and bar owners with this transition, Pernod Ricard has created The Bar World of Tomorrow (BWOT).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Objective                                                                                                                                                                  | Progress in FY21                                                                                                       | Progress in FY22                                                                                                                                             | Performance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| By 2030, train 10,000 glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> bartenders on all aspects of sustainability and responsibility - from using fresh ingredients to responsible serving | In-person: 914 glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> at 30 June.

It is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, Polish, Turkish and Mandarin. In FY20, a toolkit was shared on how to run training sessions online or in-person on the key principles of the BWOT. This is aimed at guiding S&R leaders, brand ambassadors and/or advocacy colleagues to train bar owners and bartenders. All training sessions are reported to local S&R leaders to report back the number of attendees to HQ. In addition, several tools were created to share with participants:\n\n- trash collective cocktail recipes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- a detailed checklist for the BWOT; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- a responsible serving cheat sheet; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- a 'badge' of completion. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn two years, the Group has already achieved more than half of its target to train 10,000 bartenders by 2030. This is the result of a large-scale roll-out of the programme and the efforts of affiliates to train bars, hotels and other partners. Thanks to the improvement of the health situation, the Group has been able to massively expand face-to-face training in FY22, and promote e-learning, resulting in a total of 6,383 bartenders trained since the launch of the BWOT.\n\nIn FY23, the Group will complement the training module with a self-assessment tool to generate a list of recommended actions for bar owners.\n\n## Circular making 3.3.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe world's finite resources are under huge pressure. Pernod Ricard is committed to minimising waste at every step by imagining, producing and distributing products and experiences in ways that optimise and help preserve natural resources.\n\nThe traditional single-use consumption model has now reached its limits. New circular models must emerge to protect the planet and natural resources. Circularity is one of the Group's key priorities. To become more circular, Pernod\n\nRicard is committed to moving its business towards a circular making model that fosters reduction, reuse and recycling. Such a shift will see fewer resources consumed, less waste generated and ultimately reduce Pernod Ricard's environmental impact.\n\n## Environmental management 3.3.3.1\n\nPernod Ricard strives to implement strong environmental management systems throughout the business. They are the cornerstones of the Group' strategy, helping it to:\n\n- tackle long-term environmental risks; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- reduce its environmental impact; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- seize opportunities at every level. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nEnvironmental management systems are designed to disseminate the Group's environmental standards throughout the business and embed environmental considerations into its management practices. This helps manage risks and create a more circular business.\n\nPernod Ricard uses environmental management systems to address environmental priorities and implement tangible actions across the business. Environmental management systems are built around the following principles:\n\n- the Headquarters' Sustainable Performance Division oversees glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and coordinates measures at Group level by:\n- setting shared goals, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- monitoring performance, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- circulating guidelines with minimum requirements, and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- sharing best practices. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nEach Brand Company is required to evaluate its performance against these requirements annually. Where necessary, compliance action plans must be implemented;\n\n- Pernod Ricard's activities, both for the Brand Companies and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the Market Companies, must comply with the environmental requirements outlined in the Group's environmental guidelines:\n- affiliates are accountable for complying with local legal glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> requirements. They must also report any local incidents or non-compliance to Headquarters,\n- affiliates are accountable for assessing their long-term glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> risks. They must thus identify ways of reducing their own environmental impact and apply the Group's policy locally;\n- major production sites are required to be ISO 14001 certified. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> In FY22, 92.0% of production sites were ISO 14001 certified (covering 99.6% of production);\n- Group employees and administrative sites are required to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> satisfy the 'S&R Office' guidelines regarding different topics such as green offices, governance, energy, water, waste and business travel.\n\nThis year, seven environmental incidents were reported to local authorities. Two complaints were received from third parties. This includes all possible potential impacts from an industrial site. This year, they were all related to spillage or leakage events, either of alcohol or oil affecting waters. A root cause analysis was conducted for all these events and corrective action plans drawn up. Operational procedures are in place to prevent and control various forms of spillage, and limit their impact on the environment.\n\n## Climate change: reduction 3.3.3.2 and adaptation\n\n## Alignment with TCFD recommendations\n\nPernod Ricard generates carbon emissions in a range of ways. These contribute to climate change:\n\n- directly, through the use of fossil fuels on sites (Scope 1) and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> consumption of electricity that generates greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2);\n- indirectly, through the products (agricultural raw materials, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> packaging, etc.) and services (transport, etc.) purchased (Scope 3).",

These are aligned with a well-below-2\u00b0C scenario for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and the 2\u00b0C scenario for the target intensity of the Scope 3 emissions.\n\nIn July 2021, Pernod Ricard joined the 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' to align its climate mitigation objectives with the Paris Agreement: achieve net zero global emissions by 2050 at the latest in order to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Through this commitment, the Group is revising its near-term ambitions in accordance with new SBTi recommendations defined by Net Zero Standard, FLAG guidance and GHG protocol - Land Sector and Removals.\n\nIn addition, an on-going study has been kicked off to quantify the impact of a potential climate scenario, in line with the TCFD recommendations.\n\n## Risk management\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are identified in the course of the Group's global risk mapping:\n\n- the global risk mapping, based on local risks identified by glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Group affiliates and functional risks identified by the Group's functions, is updated every three years by the internal audit team. This team reports to the Chairman and CEO. It also presents its results to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. The Group's major risks are monitored annually;\n- environmental risk mapping is based on a multi-criteria glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> mapping tool. Affiliates input the data, which is then monitored at Group level. Affiliates identify and rate environmental risks throughout a product's life cycle based on two criteria:\n- severity (including potential financial impact - scored from I. 1 to 7), and\n- probability (scored from 1 to 5).

This was done thanks to the development of an internal GHG calculation protocol and tools plus third party assessments.\n\nMore specifically, an initial study was undertaken with a third party to find a more relevant Emission Factor (EF) for Indian grain alcohol, taking into account the local specificities of the raw material (broken rice) and local energy mix for distilleries. Instead of the generic factor for grain alcohol used so far, the emission factor has been revised accordingly in this reporting to more realistically reflect the local context. It remains an interim value, pending more precise data. This updated methodology has resulted in a very significant revision to the Group's carbon emissions (+1.1 MtCO2e). The FY18 baseline has also been recalculated accordingly with the same emission factor for those raw materials.\n\nFor point of sale materials, the methodology has been revised to better reflect the average weight of each specific material category. This updated methodology has resulted in a slight change to the Group's carbon emissions (-51 ktCO2e). The FY18 baseline has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nBesides this, the FY18 baseline year has been adjusted to reflect any other significant changes such as acquisitions, and divestments.\n\nIt should be noted that packaging-related carbon emissions do not take into account minor components, such as plastic sleeves, wire caps, security labels and glass decoration.\n\n## Breakdown of Group carbon footprint by category (tons CO2e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agricultural practices\n\nAgriculture is the main contributor to Pernod Ricard's value chain carbon footprint. Pernod Ricard's products inherently rely on agriculture. Establishing and helping improve agricultural practices is therefore a strategic priority for the Group.\n\nIn its own vineyards, the Group has been running regenerative viticulture pilot projects to test new practices. It is also working with suppliers of agricultural raw materials to establish the best pathways to lower carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration within the terroirs.\n\nThe commitments and actions of Pernod Ricard in the field of agriculture are described in a dedicated pillar of the Group Sustainability & Responsibility strategy Good Times from a Good Place, presented in Subsection 3.3.1 of this report. They represent major opportunities to reduce carbon emissions but also to sequestrate atmospheric carbon into the agricultural ecosystems producing the raw materials used by the Group.\n\n## Packaging and point of sale materials\n\nPackaging and point of sale materials are the second source of carbon emissions in Pernod Ricard's value chain. To reduce their carbon impact, the Group focuses on:\n\n- enhancing the eco-design of its packaging; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- better understanding suppliers' carbon footprint composition glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> by collecting primary data that allows to pinpoint hotspots and develop relevant action plans;\n- exploring new technologies and innovative low-carbon ways glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> to produce needed packaging;",

In Europe, the Absolut Company is a member of the Clean Shipping Project, and Martell-Mumm Perrier Jou\u00ebt (MMPJ) is a partner of TransOceanic Wind Transport (TOWT). TOWT is a sailing transport company that has been implementing low-carbon sailing transport logistics solutions since 2011.\n\n## Production sites\n\nOn production sites, the Group is working on two fronts:\n\n- improving energy efficiency; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- using less and less carbon-intensive energy. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nTo encourage such transitions, the Group introduced an internal carbon price (shadow cost of carbon). It is used to prioritise low-carbon Capex projects, by improving the economic business case compared to a pure economic analysis. In FY22 the price used was \u20ac80 per tonne of CO2 equivalent.\n\nOperationally, production sites must improve energy efficiency through continuous monitoring of energy consumption and in-depth energy assessments. The idea is to set energy-efficiency targets and launch consumption reduction programmes (i.e.: renewal of processes, technologies, etc.). Several large sites have implemented ISO 50001 certified energy management systems.\n\nMoreover, the Group is working to reduce the use of fossil fuels and plans to only use renewable electricity by 2025 (either through direct sourcing or Renewable Electricity Certificates). This year, as part of the acceleration of its carbon reduction roadmap, the Group has consolidated reduction opportunities with projected investments for main contributing production sites to achieve Scopes 1 and 2 targets. The main actions and levers identified are the replacement of boilers with high energy efficiency units, steam recycling through mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) technology, the use of biofuels and biomass at distilleries, installation of on-site solar panels and renewable electricity procurement through power purchase agreements (PPA) and green certificates.\n\nTwo major Brand Companies of the Group (Irish Distillers and Chivas Brothers) are currently investing at Midleton distillery and at two single malt distilleries respectively with break-through emissions reducing technologies (MVR and bioenergy usage). They plan to deliver a carbon-neutral operation by end of 2026, having drastically reduced their emissions and by offsetting the residual balance.\n\nCompared to FY21, the carbon intensity of direct activities (measured by the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions per kL of alcohol distilled) improved by 13%. Added to the reduction obtained in the three previous years, the total reduction of the Scopes 1 and 2 intensity of production activities amounts to -18% compared to FY18 baseline. Despite this very good result, the absolute value of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions slightly increased to 301,706 t CO2e, a 2% increase from FY21 and 1% increase from FY18. The Group expects FY22 to be the peak of its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in absolute value, and plans to reduce in FY23 and following years despite the growth of production volumes, thanks to the implementation of its decarbonisation roadmaps and its on-going related Capex projects.\n\n## Breakdown of energy consumption by activity\n\nSources of energy used by the production sites ( SASB )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.",

This has resulted in the complete elimination of CFCs and the ongoing reduction of HCFCs.\n- Nitrogen and sulphur oxide emissions (NOx and SOx) glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> contributing indirectly to the greenhouse effect and environmental acidification. These compounds are produced by fossil fuel combustion. As emissions of these atmospheric pollutants are low in the alcoholic beverages sector relative to global emissions, they do not seem to have a material impact on Pernod Ricard. The Group does not therefore feel it needs to monitor such emissions annually. The major distilleries nevertheless ensure they comply with legal limits on the discharge of such pollutants.\n\n## Preserve water resources 3.3.3.3.\n\nWater is an essential component of the products manufactured by Pernod Ricard. From irrigating crops to processing raw materials, distilling, blending eaux-de-vie and formulating products, water is involved at every stage of a product's life cycle.\n\nThe Group thus faces several challenges. It must:\n\n- reduce water consumption, particularly in areas with glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> shortages;\n- preserve water quality by monitoring pollutants released by glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> production sites;\n- fully comply with evolving environmental regulations; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- support replenishment in water-stressed basins. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nPernod Ricard has been a member of the UN CEO Water Mandate since September 2010, reaffirming its commitment to protecting water resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Policies   | Objectives                                                                                                                                                               | Achievements and next steps                                                                                                                              | Performance                                                             |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|            | A further 20% reduction in water glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> usage from FY18 to FY30.                                                                                | Since FY18, water consumption per unit produced has been On plan                                                                                         | 2030 S&R Strategy glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                       |\n|            | 100% of water replenished glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> in watersheds with same level of risk for production sites and dedicated copackers located in high-risk areas. | 68.7% of the total water used in high-risk locations over the past year was replenished.

        "page_content": "To reduce direct water consumption at production sites, the Group focuses its efforts on two main drivers, setting up systems to measure and monitor water use and identifying measures to save, reuse and recycle water.\n\nThis year, the ongoing improvement in efficient water management led to a 5.6% reduction in water use per litre of pure alcohol produced in distilleries compared to last year .\n\nFor the years to come, the Group has consolidated the water reduction roadmaps from the main contributing affiliates and identified associated investment plans to achieve the 2030 targets.\n\nRegarding the agricultural supply chain, the drip irrigation technique is used in all vineyards irrigated and operated by the Group. This reduces the water used to what is strictly necessary. Moreover, given the predominance of agricultural raw materials in Pernod Ricard's water footprint, the Group works locally with the affiliates' suppliers to establish sustainable agriculture standards that minimise water consumption (see Subsections 3.3.1.3 'An agile and ambitious journey to regenerate terroirs' and 3.3.1.4'Impactful programmes on regenerative agriculture and biodiversity preservation').\n\n## Water resource preservation strategy tailored to meet local challenges ( SASB )\n\nBecause water resources are unevenly distributed, risk levels vary depending on the location of the Group's production sites and dedicated co-packing activities. To better understand and identify priorities, sites have been categorised as extremely high-risk, high-risk and medium-low risk, using an internal Water Risk Index, calculated with the use of indicators from the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas Tool. The Group aims to replenish the water used by its sites in high-risk areas through local projects to preserve the water ecosystems. This led to support for watershed management by:\n\n- improving access to safe water and sanitation; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- promoting sustainable water use; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- integrating water resource management among glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> communities.\n\n| Area's risk level          | Pernod Ricard situation                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Extremely high-risk (SASB) | 8 company-owned sites (India, Armenia, Mexico and China). glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 8.2% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>     |\n| High-risk (SASB)           | 7 company-owned sites (Armenia, Australia, Spain and France). glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 5.4% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> |\n| Medium-risk                | 25 company-owned sites. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 8.2% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                                       |\n| Low-risk                   | 47 company-owned sites. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 78.2% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                                      |\n\nThe water resource preservation strategy has been rolled out to sites in 'extremely high-risk' and 'high-risk' areas. PR India has already implemented water projects in such watersheds. It is actively engaged with communities through the development of water replenishment projects to support water conservation and ensure and improve access to safe water and sanitation. Eight dedicated Indian co-packers located in high-risk areas are covered by the Group's water resource preservation strategy.\n\nThis year, the affiliates in Armenia, Mexico and China implemented a water replenishment project. In Armenia, Yerevan Brandy Company developed a project intended to reduce drinking water wastage in Yerevan City. Penord Ricard Mexico has joined a collaborative project led by the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable (BIER) called 'Charco Bendito' in the Guadalajara basin to improve water availability and eliminate unsustainable water use with reforestation and restoration actions. In China, Helan Mountain initiated a project in the Yinchuan Baohu Wetland Park to implement water efficiency and reduction measures such as the reparation of leaking pipelines and the installation of drip-irrigation systems.\n\nOther affiliates are in the process of finding project partners and exploring water project options. The methodology used to calculate water returned to the environment for each project must be verified by a third party.\n\n## Treatment of waste water\n\nProduction sites are fitted with various technologies depending on waste water quality requirements (1) to reduce the pollutants released into the natural environment. They also ensure that water discharged by production sites does not damage surrounding ecosystems or other natural resources. The Group is also exploring innovative projects for treating waste water.\n\nThis year:\n\n- 80% of waste-water was discharged into a public sewage glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> system;\n- 15% was discharged into the environment following glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> treatment; and\n- 5% was recycled for vineyard irrigation. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n3.",

For example:\n- broken rice in India or sugarcane molasses in Cuba are glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> used to produce alcohol,\n- in developed countries, where most of the Group's glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> agricultural raw materials are sourced, the quality of infrastructure plus short supply routes prevent products such as cereals from perishing;\n- production sites: focus on recycling waste generated through glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the transformation of raw agricultural materials (spent grains, vinasse and grape pomace). The majority of waste is reused to make animal feed, biogas, farm compost or used for other industrial purposes;\n- consumer level: the waste generated is very low since wine & glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> spirits can be kept for a long time, and the packaging is designed to last until the product is fully consumed.\n\n## Reducing waste and improving recycling on industrial sites\n\nThe production sites mostly generate non-hazardous waste (99% of total waste vs. 1% hazardous waste):\n\n- non-hazardous waste: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- packaging waste (glass, paper, cardboard and plastics), glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- waste from the transformation of agricultural raw materials glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> not recovered as by-products (grape marc, stalks, lees, etc.),\n- waste produced by the site's activities (sludge from glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> treatment plants, office waste, green waste, etc.);\n- hazardous waste: products used for site operations glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (chemical product containers, used oils, solvents, electrical and electronic waste, neon tubes, batteries, etc.).\n\nThe Group is moving towards zero landfill waste. To achieve this goal, the affiliates are pursuing efforts to reduce the quantity of waste generated and identify recycling and energy recovery processes. The Group will continue to identify appropriate treatment processes locally for hazardous waste requiring the use of a specific treatment process to prevent environmental risks.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n| Overall performance                                              | Unit   | FY21   | FY22   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total quantity of waste                                          | t      | 36,687 | 36,542 |\n| Quantity of waste recycled                                       | t      | 35,161 | 34,338 |\n| Quantity of waste incinerated                                    | t      | 1,380  | 2,110  |\n| Quantity of waste sent to landfill                               | t      | 147    | 94     |\n| % of solid waste recycled                                        | %      | 96     | 94     |\n| Quantity of waste sent to landfill per litre of finished product | g/L    | 0.14   | 0.08   |\n| Quantity of hazardous waste treated externally (1)               | t      | 410    | 413    |\n\nThis year, the total quantity of waste sent to landfill has kept reducing, reaching 94 tonnes, thanks to noticeable improvements this year for Pernod Ricard France, Pernod Ricard Spain & Pernod Ricard North America.

The Group nevertheless acknowledges that alcohol can be misused and the inappropriate consumption of alcohol can cause serious problems to individuals and communities.\n\nThis is why the Group is committed to promoting responsible alcohol consumption and combating harmful drinking. This involves working with stakeholders to achieve real\n\nchange and continuously developing and strengthening its responsible business practices.\n\nPernod Ricard is not alone in promoting responsible drinking. Collaboration with industry peers, governments and local communities is essential in this area. Positive change can only be achieved through collective action.\n\n## Responsible Drinking Roadmap\n\nThe Group fully supports the World Health Organisation's (WHO) goal of reducing harmful drinking by 10% worldwide by 2025. Pernod Ricard does not, however, believe that a cut in average per capita consumption supports public health needs. In fact, the pursuit of such a strategy in the past has led to lower consumption amongst moderate drinkers without any meaningful impact on those who drink at harmful levels. To this end, the Group has a responsible drinking strategy focused on tackling the harmful use of alcohol.\n\nThis responsible drinking strategy is fully aligned with the Group's 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' vision to unlock the magic of human connection by bringing good times from a good place, as there is no conviviality in excessive or inappropriate drinking. Adult consumers are encouraged to make responsible choices about whether to drink or not, and how much alcohol to drink. This strategy is also aligned with Pernod Ricard's premiumisation strategy. The Group wants adult consumers to consume high-quality products, not increase their overall alcohol consumption.\n\nThe Group's roadmap encompasses a wide range of initiatives aimed at its employees, consumers, target audiences and the society as a whole. The set of tools includes in-house trainings, self-regulating standards, labelling initiatives, communication campaigns and evidence-based prevention programmes. By taking a comprehensive approach, the Group aims to find the most effective ways of combatting the harmful use of alcohol for each target group and context.\n\nThis year, Pernod Ricard has reviewed its responsible drinking strategy for a more streamlined and ambitious roadmap. Building on the efforts of its affiliates, the updated KPIs set a new level of ambition for the Group, in particular regarding its global responsible drinking initiatives, brand engagement and labelling initiatives.\n\nThe Alcohol in Society team within the Public Affairs Department coordinates the Group's Responsible Hosting strategy. This is implemented through the network of S&R and Public Affairs leaders.\n\nPernod Ricard is a founding member of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD) (1) . It specifically supports IARD's commitments on digital marketing, commercial practices and a series of measures to combat underage drinking (more information below).\n\n## Responsible drinking initiatives 3.3.4.1\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to preventing and reducing alcohol misuse through targeted responsible drinking initiatives rolled out in all markets in which it has an affiliate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Policies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Objectives   | Progress in FY21                                                                       | Progress in FY22   | Performance      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| In all its markets, Pernod Ricard will contribute to at least one global or local responsible drinking initiative to fight alcohol misuse (2025): global initiatives to fight glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> binge drinking including amongst young adults (Responsible Party and | N/A          | 93% of markets have contributed to a local or global responsible drinking initiatives. | On plan            | 2030 S&R Roadmap |\n\n3.",

        "page_content": "The four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place roadmap\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nPernod Ricard wants to fight alcohol misuse in a meaningful way through targeted responsible drinking initiatives, as an appropriate level of investment in responsible drinking is crucial for the long-term sustainability of its business.\n\nAll the Group's Market Companies will contribute, as a minimum, to either one responsible drinking initiative implemented locally in partnership with industry peers, civil society or local authorities, or one global responsible drinking initiative developed by the Group.\n\n## Local initiatives\n\nPernod Ricard believes that targeted preventive actions, rolled out locally with industry partners and others, are an effective way of tackling alcohol abuse and make alcohol consumption a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\nUnfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the roll-out of many local initiatives, which were put on hold or stopped altogether. This is notably why the Group has intensified its work this year on its global initiatives to help its affiliates fight alcohol misuse in their market in a meaningful way.\n\nThis year, Pernod Ricard contributed to local responsible drinking initiatives in 53 markets.\n\n## Global initiatives\n\nPernod Ricard developed two types of global responsible drinking initiatives which are being rolled out by its Market Companies:\n\n- global initiatives to fight binge drinking including amongst (i) young adults; and\n- 'Autosobriety', a global partnership with UNITAR to prevent (ii) drink-driving.\n\n## Global initiatives to fight binge drinking\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to fighting binge drinking around the world, notably through its Responsible Party flagship programme and its digital campaign 'Drink More Water'.\n\nResponsible Party was originally launched in 2009 through a partnership between Erasmus Student Network, the largest European student organisation, and Pernod Ricard. It has expanded since then to all young adults.\n\nIt raises awareness about the risks of binge drinking among young adults and aims at reducing alcohol-related harm linked to this dangerous drinking practice, in Europe and beyond. This programme is not linked to any brand, has its own visual identity, and is based on a peer-to-peer approach. Its 13 years of experience have successfully challenged the concept of responsibility of young adults by empowering them to make the right decisions.\n\nDrink More Water is the new digital campaign under the umbrella of Responsible Party, released in July 2021 to broaden its scope and reach more young adults during covid times. The message chosen with 'Drink More Water' is a clear and universal call for action. The campaign is bold, targeting Gen Z with their own codes. Initially rolled out digitally, Drink More Water is currently expanding to bars, festivals, and other festive venues.\n\nThe Drink More Water campaign has already shown its success by reaching over 134 million young adults digitally in 34 markets.\n\nThe Responsible Party programme has reached 500,000 young adults on the field through activations during student parties over the last 10 years. During this fiscal year, the physical activations of this initiative remained quite low due to Covid restrictions.\n\nPernod Ricard also rolled out a successful digital campaign in Asia this year to fight binge drinking. At the beginning of 2022, Pernod Ricard Asia launched a cross-market digital campaign dedicated to responsible alcohol consumption. Five markets (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines) participated in the initiative called 'Make Memories, Not Hangovers'. The campaign reached 6.3 million individuals and specifically targeted adults between the local legal drinking age and 30 years of age. The goals of 'Make Memories, Not Hangovers' were to raise awareness on the dangers of binge drinking with young adults, to educate the audience on responsible drinking by correcting misconceptions about alcohol consumption and to shift the audience's mindset towards responsible alcohol consumption.\n\n## Autosobriety\n\nPernod Ricard strongly believes that alcohol-related road traffic crashes are preventable tragedies. And to this end, education is key: people need to understand how alcohol affects the ability to drive in order to make the right choice not to drink and drive.\n\nFor the past two years Pernod Ricard has been partnering with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) on the roll-out of the Autosobriety training programme. Autosobriety aims at equipping road safety stakeholders with educational tools to raise awareness on the risks of drinking and driving and contributes to preventing and reducing alcohol-related road crashes.\n\nThe overall objective of Autosobriety is to contribute to the UN Global Road Safety Performance Target #9 to halve the number of alcohol-related road traffic injuries and fatalities by 2030.\n\nAutosobriety's main asset is an online educational module covering four topics:\n\n- road crash statistics; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the impact of alcohol on the ability to drive and relevant glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> risks;\n- the legal ramifications of drinking and driving; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- personal responsibility to avoid drink-driving. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn addition, an augmented reality video was developed to simulate the effects of alcohol on driving and the increasing risks of road accidents.\n\nThe project was first piloted in the Durban province in South Africa and in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThis year, the Group signed, as a strategic ally, the Memorandum of Understanding entered into between UNITAR and the General Secretariat of the Andean Community for the disseminating the Autosobriety programme in the Andean Community. In the same year, Autosobriety was launched in Ecuador.\n\nAutosobriety was also launched in Mexico this year and Poland will soon follow. The programme is expanding in Cambodia and Vietnam where the Group is bringing locally run road safety initiatives under the Autosobriety training programme.",

Most of the Group's markets contribute to at least one responsible drinking initiative, either locally or through a global initiative. Building on this very positive assessment, Pernod Ricard will now accelerate the implementation of its global responsible drinking initiatives by focusing on key markets.\n\nThe four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place roadmap\n\nThe Group will be rolling out its emblematic binge drinking prevention campaign 'Drink More Water' in 40 markets, and will also continue activating this initiative on the field, in bars, in music festivals and with its partners, especially the Erasmus Student Network in Europe.\n\nPernod Ricard's 'Autosobriety' partnership with UNITAR will be expanded in four additional countries in the next financial year, bringing the programme to at least 10 countries by the end of 2023.\n\n## Brand campaigns 3.3.4.2\n\nThe Group is committed to fight alcohol misuse at every point of the consumer journey.

Brands know how to talk to consumers and their campaigns can be an effective way of changing attitudes and making alcohol abuse socially unacceptable.\n\nThis new commitment has been embraced by Pernod Ricard's brands, with a first responsible drinking campaign rolled out by Martell in China.\n\nLeveraging the influence of celebrity Tony Leung, Martell sponsored a branded responsible drinking initiative in China in margin of its Cordon Bleu campaign. This first phase was dedicated to spreading messages against drink driving and was amplified through a media effort leading to more than 500 media clipping and a social buzz with more than 55 million individuals.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nIt is anticipated that at least three responsible drinking campaigns will be rolled out by strategic brands during the next fiscal.\n\n## Responsible marketing 3.3.4.3\n\nAll Pernod Ricard's brands will communicate externally with a due sense of ethics and social responsibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Policies                                                                                                      | Objectives                                                                                             | Progress in FY21                                                     | Progress in FY22                                                                                | Performance                              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| No complaint upheld against glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Pernod Ricard's marketing campaigns (every year). | N/A glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                                                                    | No complaint received. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>               | Achieved                                                                                        | 2030 S&R Roadmap                         |\n| glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 2024.                                                                         | 95% compliance with IARD Digital Guiding Principles by                                                 | 89% measured by internal monitoring. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> | 95% compliance with Digital Guiding Principles measured through artifical intelligence (AI) and | glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Achieved |\n| glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Communications.                                                               | 100% completion rate on the e-learning (1) for the Code for Commercial glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> | 75.3%.                                                               | 82% of the targeted glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> population reached.                         | On plan                                  |\n\n3.",

Going beyond the Advertising and Marketing Communications Code of the International Chamber of Commerce, Pernod Ricard's Code for Commercial Communications (CCC) has been in place since 2007. It ensures that the Group's commercial communications do not encourage or condone irresponsible consumption or misuse of any kind.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to industry leadership in helping raise standards for the responsible marketing of alcoholic beverages. Hence, the Group has extended its disciplines on traditional advertising to online advertising, namely Digital Guiding Principles (DGPs) for the most commonly used platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube) and websites. The internal monitoring in 2021 allowed 647 URLs to be checked. The external audit mandated in 2022 captured a larger scope of 1,032 URLs, thus allowing better compliance with IARD standards.\n\nAlso, in 2020, the Group updated its CCC, strengthening all guidelines (provision mandating models be over 25 years of age and meet certain requirements). In 2021, it added guidelines regarding product placement to keep raising standards.\n\nIn view of achieving a 95% compliance goal Pernod Ricard decided to take a more ambitious stance and has launched an artificial intelligence-based audit to better capture and expand the scope of the measurement for this achievement.\n\n## Responsible Marketing Panel (RMP)\n\nCreated in 2005, the RMP is responsible for the ethical oversight of advertising. It thus screens all advertising material due to be rolled out. It has six members and a secretary general. They are all independent of the Marketing Department. The RMP reports to the Executive Committee every month. Two Executive\n\nCommittee members act as sponsors and are also consulted on any changes to the CCC or the drafting of implementing guidelines to ensure Pernod Ricard is as fully compliant as possible with the most stringent Responsible Marketing standards.\n\nAll commercial communications must be submitted to the RMP. It issues an opinion within seven days. All decisions are taken collectively by RMP members and are binding on everyone in the Group.\n\nFor FY22, as the result of an internal communication campaign and more trainings, the RMP was able to assess a total of 836 requests including:\n\n- 543 campaigns approved with no restrictions; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 68 campaigns approved and subject to modifications; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 2 campaigns rejected; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 223 requests for advice. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nDue to the pandemic, it was not possible to systematically train face-to-face all affiliates on Responsible Marketing. Nevertheless, 347 people from various affiliates received a dedicated training.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nWith the implementation of the Pernod Ricard CCC, the Group will continue to deliver a Convivialit\u00e9 brand experience and responsibility in compliance with industry commitments and advertising authority requirements. Pernod Ricard will explore how to accelerate through digital and AI to ensure even stricter control of marketing assets.\n\nPernod Ricard believes there is a need for some industry guidelines for new modes of marketing ( e.g. gaming, metaverse). It will engage in constructive dialogue on this with all stakeholders.\n\n## Responsible sales 3.3.4.4\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to fighting underage drinking, notably by preventing the online sale and delivery of its products to minors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Policies                                                                                                                | Objectives                    | Progress in FY21                                                                       | Progress in FY22   | Performance      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| All Pernod Ricard's Direct To glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Consumer (D2C) sites will be age-gated (2022).            | On track                      | 100% compliance (audit via AI).                                                        | Achieved           | 2030 S&R Roadmap |\n| Roadmap The Group will share global glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> standards and trainings with all its e-commerce and | delivery partners (2025).

This is compared with the targets set in the MoU of no less than 66% by December 2022.\n\nThe MoU provides for the sharing of ingredients and full nutritional information online. In addition to providing such information on its brand websites, Pernod Ricard is developing a digital label for all its alcoholic portfolio to share product and health information (see below). The Group is also working closely with the European industry bodies and stakeholders on the creation of the U-label to allow wine and spirits producers to share their product information online.\n\n## Responsible drinking logos\n\nPernod Ricard has started implementing the commitment it took in 2020 to add an age restriction logo and a logo warning against driving whilst intoxicated on all its back labels, alongside the logo warning against drinking during pregnancy that the Group has added to its labels since 2006.\n\nImplementation guidelines were issued this year and full implementation is expected by 2024 in line with the implementation of the QR Code ( see below ). Reporting on completion rate will be done together with the QR Code and should be performed for the first time next year.\n\n## Employee engagement 3.3.4.7\n\nPernod Ricard's employees are the primary and best ambassadors for responsible drinking.

        "page_content": "## Objectives and policies\n\n## MOOConalcohol & responsible drinking\n\nPernod Ricard has developed an online training on alcohol and responsible drinking. It was launched in April 2020 and translated into 21 languages. This training gives information on alcohol and alcohol-related risks. Employees can thus learn the facts about alcohol and make informed decisions as to whether to drink alcohol and how to drink responsibly.\n\nThe training embeds the Group's Global Responsible Drinking Charter. The Group expects all employees to comply with this Charter as a breach could present a risk to the health and safety of employees and third parties.\n\nThis training has been made compulsory for all Group employees worldwide. This year the Group almost achieved its target of training 100% of its active employees and has committed to keeping this target on a yearly basis.\n\nThis year, Pernod Ricard also shared a guide with its employees for parents and carers at Pernod Ricard on 'How to talk to children about alcohol?'.\n\nThe Group has taken a strong commitment to fighting underage drinking. As their most influential role models, parents and carers are in the best position to equip young people with knowledge about the risks of underage drinking and how to make safer choices around alcohol. However, engaging in a conversation with children on that topic can be difficult. That is why the Group has prepared this guide for its employees, up to\n\n## Ethics & compliance 3.4\n\n## The Group's ethical practices 3.4.1\n\n## Quality, food safety and product compliance 3.4.1.1\n\nPernod Ricard aims to provide customers with products of the highest quality. It thus places particular importance on consumer health and safety. This has resulted in a significant effort in terms of the prevention of risks associated with alcohol abuse (see Subsection 3.3.4 'Responsible Hosting'). It also led to a strict policy in terms of food safety during product design, sourcing and manufacturing.\n\nThe control of consumer product safety is based on the implementation of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) method. This aims to identify all potential risk points in the manufacturing process. Appropriate preventive measures are put in place to control them. Brand Companies producing the Group's strategic brands are ISO 9001 certified. This represents 100% of the volume produced. In addition, and despite Wines & Spirits being less exposed to food safety risks than other food industry segments, Pernod Ricard decided to have its facilities certified to the ISO 22000, standard (Food safety management systems). In a proactive manner, some Pernod Ricard facilities are FSSC 22000 certified. The FSSC 22000 is an extension of the existing ISO 22000.\n\nInternal quality standards are drawn up by Pernod Ricard for its industrial activities including various specific guidelines. The aim is to control risks such as the accidental contamination of a product or the presence of a foreign body in a bottle. These standards are audited as part of an internal cross-audit process.\n\nIn FY22, health conditions made it possible to perform on-site cross-audits again.\n\nThe Group's top priorities are to i) ensure its products comply with applicable regulations in each market, and ii) guarantee food safety for consumers. A food law and food safety watch is continuously done and a summary is circulated to all affiliates every two months. This helps them stay abreast of any changes to applicable regulations and food safety risks. A chemical analysis plan for the Group's main products is drawn up annually. In FY22, this involved 99 finished products with over 3,500 analyses being carried out.\n\nIn addition, a Group tool is used to record and track quality complaints from consumers in real time. The affiliate in question is immediately informed so that corrective action can be taken. In the event of a serious product safety concern, the system also immediately informs Headquarters. This allows for a rapid response. Each affiliate has a crisis management procedure. This is particularly for product health risk involving, if necessary, a product recall. These procedures are subject to regular testing, training for those involved and updates. Quality indicators including the complaints rate are presented to Senior Management. The current Group tool is an interactive web tool, Intelex (Loop application), launched in 2022 and replacing the Complaint Management System (CMS) web tool, which was launched in 2007.\n\nthem to decide to use it or not in their role of adults talking to minors. It is based on the materials of leading independent alcohol education charities and aims to provide them with up-to-date and accurate tips on how to prepare, launch, and lead the alcohol-related conversation.\n\n## Training of sales staff on the prevention of alcohol-related risks\n\nPernod Ricard's sales staff and brand ambassadors are at the frontline of the Group's business. Because of their job, they might find themselves in challenging situations relating to the consumption of alcohol. This is why, this year, the Group launched a new dedicated training programme to prevent alcohol-related risks amongst its sales staff and brand ambassadors. Throughout this training, they will learn how to identify alcohol-related risks for themselves and consumers and how to respond in a professional and safe manner.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nPernod Ricard will continue to train its employees on responsible drinking and to enrol them as ambassadors for responsible drinking through their acknowledgement and signing of the Global Responsible Drinking Charter.\n\nPernod Ricard will start rolling out its new training programme for the sales staff and brand ambassadors on the prevention of alcohol-related risks.\n\n3.",

This ensures strict compliance with the labelling regulations for products containing GMOs. Accordingly, all affiliates conduct a risk assessment to identify potential sources of raw materials, taking the necessary steps to\n\nensure their control. Although the distillation stage eliminates the risk that GMO material may be present in distilled products, supply chains for products that are guaranteed GMO-free have been established for certain corn-based alcohols in the US and Europe.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n|                                                                                               | FY21   | FY22   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| % of sites ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 certified by June of the fiscal year                          | 78%    | 78%    |\n| % ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 certified in volume produced covering all the Group's strategic brands | 99.7%  | 100%   |\n| % of Brand Companies producing Group's strategic brands certified ISO 9001                    | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Number of complaints received through the 'CMS/Intelex (Loop)' during the fiscal year         | 4,100  | 3,150  |\n\n## Personal data protection 3.4.1.2\n\nPersonal data protection is a pillar of the Group's digital transformation. It is a business opportunity for Pernod Ricard to:\n\n- ensure the accuracy and relevance of the personal data it glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> collects;\n- gain a better understanding of consumers; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- develop consumer trust; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- secure brand image; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- continue to promote its culture of conviviality. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIt is also an opportunity to rethink and optimise existing processes by adopting best practice on personal data retention, rights management, etc.\n\nThe regulatory framework for personal data protection that applies to Pernod Ricard is complex and still evolving. Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force four years ago, many countries and regions have adopted personal data protection laws and regulations, and non-compliance with these rules may expose the Group to sanctions.\n\n## Global strategy & governance\n\nPernod Ricard has implemented a strong personal data protection strategy and governance.\n\nThe Group drafted a comprehensive personal data protection roadmap ahead of GDPR enforcement. It works daily on GDPR compliance, in parallel with specific actions to address local requirements where relevant.\n\nThe Group DPO (Data Protection Officer) and the Group's personal data protection network enable Pernod Ricard to implement personal data protection compliance actions, implement policies and procedures at local level, and share best practices.\n\nThis governance structure involves a wide range of stakeholders, including the Group DPO, personal data protection champions regionally and locally, along with a Personal Data Protection Steering Committee and the various internal business teams (IT, marketing, HR, etc.).\n\n## Employee engagement & upskilling\n\nAs a pillar of the Group's digital transformation, personal data protection is a matter that concerns everyone at Pernod Ricard. This is why it places particular focus and effort on:\n\n- legal monitoring; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- employee training (including with Group-wide MOOCs as well glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> as both mandatory and tailored subject-specific trainings);\n- internal awareness campaigns; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- more generally on change management. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Custom tools & procedures\n\nThe Group has created various custom, user-friendly tools and procedures to ensure personal data protection compliance. These include:\n\n- comprehensive overarching documentation to ensure glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> consistent implementation of personal data protection and common standards. These are based on a global personal data protection policy, adapted to local requirements, along with detailed procedures and toolkits;\n- personal data protection by design and by default procedures glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and processes implemented on new projects, with specific privacy documentation on major projects;\n- audit processes and questionnaires to assess the maturity of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> third parties and compliance level on personal data protection;\n- checklists and templates on specific topics such as handling glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> data subject requests or handling potential personal data protection breaches.",

        "page_content": "## Prevention of corruption and anti-competitive practices 3.4.1.3\n\n## Prevention of corruption\n\nIntegrity and a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and all related misconduct have long been part of Pernod Ricard's core values.\n\n## Unambiguous tone from the top\n\n- The Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct, prefaced and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> endorsed by the Chairman and CEO, applies to all Group employees.\n- Pernod Ricard's Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer is in glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> charge of structuring and promoting the Group's comprehensive and robust anti-corruption programme.\n\n## Corruption & influence peddling risk map update\n\nIn 2022, Pernod Ricard updated its Group corruption and influence peddling risk map, and presented the results to the Executive Board, the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. Involving more than 1,440 employees, over 300 workshops worldwide, this project covered a full perimeter and generated a new corruption and influence peddling risk map that is an accurate reflection of the Group's operational & geographical realities.\n\n## Acomprehensive programme designed to protect against, detect and assess specific risks\n\n## Prevention\n\n- Pernod Ricard's Code of Business Conduct : the Code (1) was glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> overhauled in 2022 to be more practical and easier to use. It still includes, in particular, a section on anticorruption and business integrity in general. The new Code also covers other topics such as competition law, prevention of insider trading and conflicts of interest, but also health & safety, diversity & inclusion, speaking on social media, data ethics, harassment, bullying, confidentiality and Sustainability & Responsibility. It provides for practical advice on how to behave in real life situations, and whom to reach in case of doubt.\n- Group anti-bribery policy: in accordance with the French glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 2016 Sapin II law, the Policy specifically details the Group's rules to prevent, deter and detect public and private corruption and influence peddling risks. It also provides employees and stakeholders with clear, pragmatic examples of potentially sensitive situations.\n- Prior verification policy : Pernod Ricard's Third Parties are glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> subject to a due diligence process to determine their compliance risk profile (low, medium or high), allowing the Group to adjust, as appropriate, contractual and operational relationships to mitigate potential risks. Various levels of verification are set out under the procedure, depending on the initial risk assessment of each relationship category, as identified by Pernod Ricard's Sapin II risk map on corruption and influence peddling. This due diligence process is implemented via 'Partner Up' , the Group's global web-based platform where any employee engaging the Group in a business transaction can conduct adequate prior verification on relevant third parties.\n- Online training: training for employees on all chapters of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Code of Business Conduct. With a 'learning by doing' approach, a new mandatory MOOC was kicked off in 2019 to\n\ntrain employees on the updated Code of Business Conduct. This training was successfully completed by 92% of the mandatory target audience during the first campaign ( i.e. , all employees with a company-issued electronic device). Since then, the MOOC is mandatory as part of the onboarding pack for new employees and completion is digitally monitored.\n\n## Detection\n\n- Gifts and Hospitality policy : approval is required from the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Line Manager or the affiliate's designated key contact prior to receiving or offering any gifts or hospitality above a determined amount set at affiliate level.\n- 'Gifted!' : the Group's app to declare and seek approval to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> give or receive gifts and hospitality in accordance with the provisions of the Gifts & Hospitality policies. The app is accessible on all electronic devices.\n- Whistleblowing policy : employees and stakeholders are glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> invited to speak up about, amongst other things, any potential corruption involving Pernod Ricard activities inside or outside the Company. As part of the protection offered to whistleblowers, alerts may be filed anonymously, and the Group promotes a clear non-retaliation policy (see Subsection 3.4.2.3 'Whistleblower system'). Pernod Ricard's whistleblowing policy is underpinned by the global whistleblowing line: 'Speak Up' . It is accessible to all third parties worldwide (Internet or telephone), 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in a wide variety of languages. It offers confidentiality and anonymity (where allowed by local legislation) to encourage Pernod Ricard stakeholders to raise concerns about, among other things, any corruption-related matter or any breach of the rules set forth in the Code of Business Conduct.\n- Internal control principles : they apply to all Group affiliates glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and specify that all Pernod Ricard affiliates must comply, among other things, with the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct and the Procurement Code of Ethics. Pernod Ricard annually sends a self-assessment questionnaire to all affiliates. In this, they must state whether they are compliant with Group policies. The reliability of the responses is confirmed in a letter of representation signed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each entity.\n\n## Control & assessment\n\nIn addition, the Legal Department works with the internal audit team to support the compliance audit stream in the annual audit cycle. Finally, internal audit is also tasked with monitoring Group compliance with the rules in place to fight corruption and influence peddling.\n\n## Remediation\n\nEach time a breach of the Code of Conduct rules is confirmed following an internal investigation, a wide range of remediations and mitigating measures may be decided by management, including disciplinary sanctions on any employee responsible for such misconduct. The Group promotes a zero tolerance on breaches of internal rules and values and may - in accordance with local labour laws, decide to apply sanctions up to termination of employment.\n\n3.",

The MOOC also includes a chapter on Competition law.\n\n## Transparency and integrity of strategies 3.4.1.4 and influencing practices\n\n## Objectives & Policies\n\nGroup policy on lobbying is governed by the Code of Business Conduct. The Code was updated in May 2022 and a mandatory e-learning content has been created for employees covering prevention of corruption and bribery. This contains specific rules on dealings with public officials in the chapter related to prevention of corruption. It is also guided by more specific professional Codes (1) and institutional Codes such as the EU Transparency Register (2) , with which Pernod Ricard complies.\n\nIn addition, specific laws & regulations apply across the countries in which the Group operates. For instance, in France, the Group is registered on the list of representatives of interests established by the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (3) . It strictly complies with the High Authority's reporting obligations regarding lobbying activities. Transparency International even acknowledged its detailed reporting practice in their presentation of committed firms.\n\nThe Group has been a member of Transparency International France since 2013 and actively supports the promotion of transparency and integrity around lobbying and the work being done by this association. It is a signatory to a best practice guide on parliamentary lobbying expenditure.\n\nThe Group is a proactive signatory of a declaration published on 25 February 2014, together with seven companies who are members of Transparency International France. This declaration is open to all companies, business federations, professional associations, trade unions and NGOs (members and non-members of Transparency France) who wish to show leadership through their ethics and corporate social responsibility commitments. This joint declaration on lobbying was strengthened and updated in May 2019, with new signatories reaffirming their commitments (4) . As a result of such commitment and relationship, Pernod Ricard expanded the description of its advocacy priorities and positions on its public facing website this year (5) . This provides more detail to the public as to the public policy options that Pernod Ricard promotes in its dealings with stakeholders.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\n- Continue to work closely with Transparency International. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Roll out the revised version of the Code of Business Conduct glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> across the organisation.\n\n## Tax policy 3.4.1.5\n\n## Asignificant contribution to local communities\n\nThe Group commits to complying with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates along with applicable international standards.\n\nIn 2022, Pernod Ricard's income tax charge on recurring items (profit from recurring operations and financial result from recurring operations) was \u20ac651 million.\n\nIn addition to corporate income tax, Pernod Ricard pays and collects numerous other taxes and contributions as part of the Group's economic contribution to the communities in which it operates. These include:\n\n- sales taxes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- customs and excise; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- duties; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- payroll taxes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- property taxes; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- and other local taxes specific to each country. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nPernod Ricard's total annual contribution is estimated at around \u20ac6.7 billion (unaudited data).\n\n## Approach to taxation\n\nThe Group applies the following principles in tax matters:\n\n- support for operational activities in compliance with glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> applicable regulations;\n- integrity in the conduct of tax matters; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- tax management that is both proactive and efficient to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> preserve and maximise the value generated for the Group and its shareholders.\n\nPernod Ricard has subsidiaries in some 74 countries in which it operates. Whenever possible, management makes every effort to liquidate any dormant or quasi-dormant subsidiary inherited from past acquisitions.\n\nPernod Ricard is vigilant as to the operational and commercial reality of its transactions and refuses to take part in any artificial tax arrangements. The Group will only use tax incentives after considering their impact on its brands, reputation and S&R. The Group does not promote any form of tax evasion.\n\n## Transfer pricing\n\nPernod Ricard's strategy and organisation are built on a decentralised model with an ongoing relationship between Brand Companies and Market Companies. The Brand Companies generally own, protect and develop the intellectual property. They are also responsible for developing overall brand strategy as well as solutions and ways to activate them. The Market Companies implement this strategy locally.\n\nRelated-party transactions are done in accordance with the Group's transfer pricing policy, which is based on the arm's length principle (6) .",

The role of the S&R Committee within the Board of Directors is to monitor progress on the S&R Strategy, challenge goals and report to the wider Board.\n\nRegarding the monitoring of measures, the Group uses various internal reporting systems and indicators to monitor implementation of the actions taken. The results have already been extensively published and audited in a fully transparent manner in this report (see Sections 2, 3 and 4 in particular).\n\n## Risk identification and mapping 3.4.2.1\n\nPernod Ricard faces a range of internal and external risks in its own operations as well as in its supply chain. The main risks currently identified by the Group, along with the relevant methodology, are discussed under 'Risk factors' in Section 4 'Risk management'. Further discussion can be found at the start of Section 3 under the heading 'The main sustainability risks and opportunities'. The mapping processes described below were drawn from Pernod Ricard's existing risk management systems. In addition, in line with the requirement to publish a 'Non-Financial Statement', the Group has published its main non-financial risks and opportunities in Section 3.\n\n3.",

The Group's Code of Business Conduct advocates a Speak-up policy. This calls on all employees to report any ethical concern. This may relate to a practice or situation deemed to be contrary to or inconsistent with the Code, associated policies or any laws or regulations.\n\nPernod Ricard Ethics & Compliance team operates a Group-wide system: Speak-Up. It allows stakeholders wishing to report potential misconduct to do so in a safe and confidential manner. Hosted by a third party, it is available 24/7. Reports that are deemed to have been filed in good faith are investigated following a preliminary assessment by the Integrity Committee (1) .\n\nIf the allegations are deemed to be substantiated, the Integrity Committee or its local delegate examines their severity and provides recommendations on the appropriate mitigation and/or remediation measures and/or disciplinary sanctions against the wrongdoer(s).\n\nPernod Ricard has a zero-tolerance policy towards retaliation against anyone who has reported an allegation or supported an investigation in good faith. Pernod Ricard conducted dedicated workshops with Human Resources Directors and with the legal and compliance network to manage whistleblowing cases and conduct investigations. The Group also runs global communications campaigns to increase awareness and improve employee understanding on what can be reported and how alerts are being processed.",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy 3.4.3\n\n## Overview of the EU taxonomy regulation\n\nStemming from the European Commission's Action Plan for Sustainable Finance launched in 2018, the Taxonomy Regulation (1) constitutes an essential component of the EU's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal and make Europe carbon-neutral by 2050. The new classification system for sustainable activities aims to help redirect capital flows towards a more sustainable economy.\n\nUnder the Taxonomy Regulation, technical screening criteria are defined to identify activities that significantly contribute to six major environmental objectives:\n\n- climate change mitigation; (i)\n- adaptation to climate change; (ii)\n- sustainable use and protection of water and marine (iii) resources;\n- transition to a circular economy; (iv)\n- pollution prevention and control; and (v)\n- protection and restoration of biodiversity and the (vi) ecosystem.\n\nSince 1 January 2022, reporting businesses must provide financial information in their annual report on activities that are Taxonomy-eligible (when the activity is covered by the Taxonomy Regulation).\n\nPernod Ricard is required to publish KPIs highlighting the proportion of its Taxonomy-eligible turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) resulting from products and services associated with economic activities defined as sustainable in Annexes I & II of the Climate Delegated Acts (2) .\n\n## Presentation of the eligibility results\n\nThe scope of calculation of the Taxonomy indicators is the consolidated financial scope as detailed in Note 7 \" Consolidation scope\" in Section 6.6.\n\n## Turnover\n\nWhen considering eligible turnover for the purposes of the Taxonomy Regulation, Pernod Ricard uses a materiality threshold of 1% of the Group's consolidated turnover. Given that the first two climate objectives applicable as of 2021 prioritise economic activities that contribute significantly to EU Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, Pernod Ricard's core business of manufacturing and selling beverages is not covered by the Climate Delegated Act. Consequently, the Group's eligible turnover represents 0% of its 2022 consolidated turnover (\u20ac10,701 million, Section 6.1 \" Consolidated annual financial statement \") (3) .\n\n- Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to promote sustainable investments and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. (1) Available here.\n- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Available here. (2)\n- Additional information on the calculation of the KPI linked to revenue is presented in the methodological note (see Section 3.6.1). (3)\n- Additional information on the calculation of the KPI linked to investment expenditure is presented in the methodological note (see Section 3.6.1). (4)\n- Total Opex consists of (i) direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development; (ii) building renovation measures, short-term lease and (5) maintenance and repair, and (iii) any other direct expenditure relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n- The exemption of Opex KPI is described in the methodological note (see Section 3.6.1). (6)\n- For more information on the S&R commitments, targets, actions and contribution to SDGs, please see the previous pages. (7)\n\n## Capital expenditures (Capex)\n\nDue to the non-eligibility of its revenue-generating activities, Pernod Ricard's eligible Capex does not include Capex directly related to its activities and only concerns Capex implemented under 'individually sustainable measures', as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation. They represent 29.1% of the Group's acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets in 2021 (\u20ac669 million, Section 6.6 Note 4.1 Intangible assets and Note 4.2 Property, plant and equipment ) (4) .\n\nThese eligible investments mostly relate to the following types of activities:\n\n- real estate assets such as brand homes, onsite offices and 1) distilleries;\n- leasing of vehicle fleets; 2)\n- renewable energy technologies. 3)\n\n## Operating expenditures (Opex)\n\nOpex, as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation (5) , represent less than 5% of Pernod Ricard's total Opex in FY22. As a result, it is deemed non-material and exempt from the calculation of the numerator of Opex KPI as permitted by the regulation (6) .\n\n## Links to S&R achievements & initiatives\n\nPernod Ricard's strong climate, biodiversity and circular economy commitments are fully embedded in its S&R strategy \"Good Times from a Good Place\" which covers the entire value chain, from grain to glass.\n\nActions by Pernod Ricard that do not necessarily fall under the definition in the Taxonomy Regulation, hence resulting into non-eligible turnover, Capex and Opex should not be interpreted as reflecting the Group's progress towards sustainability objectives, as its ambitious 2030 roadmap is aligned with the UN SDGs (7) .\n\n3.",

        "page_content": "Ethics & compliance\n\n## Priority ambition to combat climate change\n\nPernod Ricard makes it a priority to fight climate change. This is translated into the ambitious carbon reduction targets set by the Group, aligned with the Science-Based Targets Initiative. For Scopes 1 and 2 (energy used directly on Group production sites), the Group's current target is to reduce its emissions by 54% by 2030 from its FY18 base year. This will mainly be achieved through investment in new energy-related technologies in Group distilleries, such as mechanical vapour recompression in Ireland (Irish Distillers) and Scotland (Chivas Brothers). This solution has already been implemented in Sweden by The Absolut Co. In parallel, the Group will switch globally to renewable electricity sources by 2025, following the Group commitment to RE100 (1) .\n\nFurthermore, in 2022, the Group launched its inaugural 'sustainability-linked' bond issue for \u20ac750 million. This transaction is indexed to two environmental commitments:\n\n- reduction of Pernod Ricard's absolute amount of GHG glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> emissions (Scopes 1 and 2); and\n- reduction of its water consumption in its distilleries per unit glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of alcohol produced.\n\nPernod Ricard is also focused on reducing its Scope 3 emissions, which are indirectly generated by the Group and its suppliers. Carbon reduction is now fully integrated into business discussions with glass manufacturers, in order to ensure they commit to lower carbon emissions for their supplies to the Group. Together with its regenerative agriculture engagement, this will contribute to achieving the Group's commitment to reduce its overall carbon intensity by 50% by 2030.\n\n## Projects that contribute to the circular economy transition and biodiversity protection\n\nThe KPIs of the Group's Taxonomy-eligible turnover, Capex and Opex are expected to increase when the four remaining environmental objectives, in particular \"Transition to a circular economy\" and \"Protection of biodiversity\", are added to the Delegated Regulations (assumption based on the most recent report from the Platform on Sustainable Finance (2) ).\n\nPernod Ricard's commitment to protect biodiversity is reflected in its strong regenerative agriculture engagement. The ambition of the Group is to have a positive impact in all its main 'terroirs', where raw materials are sourced. In its vineyards, Pernod Ricard local affiliates are testing regenerative practices, restoring life in the soil and in the ecosystem. Projects are being initiated with farmers to develop alternative ways to grow cereals or other crops used by the Group that have a positive impact on biodiversity and farming resilience. Pernod Ricard has become the first company to join the IUCN 'Agriculture and Land Health Initiative', a new international initiative designed to accelerate the transition to sustainable agriculture as a means of combating climate change and the loss of biodiversity.\n\nFurthermore, Pernod Ricard supports various projects in the field of circular economy, including a pilot programme launched by Absolut, Beefeater and Havana Club in Hong Kong and Singapore in partnership with ecoSPIRITS (3) . This programme will allow Pernod Ricard to reduce waste and CO2 emissions from the production and transport of glass bottles through reusable containers and bulk distribution.",

It is actively working with others to develop initiatives that fully align with the business's commitment to sustainability.\n\nLast September, Pernod Ricard was once again awarded LEAD membership of the Global Compact. This reflects its ongoing commitment to the UN SDGs and to the Global Compact's ten principles of responsible business. This year, the Group also signed up as an Early Adopter of the new Communication on Progress (COP) of the Global Compact. This is designed to help improve reporting on SDGs and contribute to the enhancement of the digital reporting platform. This new COP will enable companies to understand, measure, track and disclose their progress on the Ten Principles and their contribution to the SDGs.\n\nAchieving a better world, as the Global Compact recommends, requires taking responsibility and taking action. True to its convivial spirit, the Group actively supported Ukraine and the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nOther SDGs impacted\n\nSDG targets to which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Priority SGDs   | Pernod Ricard contributes                                                                      | Section 3 subsection title                                                     | Pages   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                 | 12.2;

It relates to the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. Unless otherwise stated, this data relates to activities under the Group's operational control.\n\n## Scope of social reporting\n\nThe social analysis in this report is based on all Group entities reporting data for their employees for the relevant period. When the Group acquires full ownership of a new entity, its corporate HR data is included in full in the figures. At the end of each financial year, the list of entities within the Group's social reporting is compared to the financial reporting list to ensure completeness. In FY22, reporting covered 137 entities with employees during the year.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and level of detail for corporate data have changed since FY19. Social data is no longer reported by affiliate but by legal entity.\n\nThe following entities are inactive in Workday but still existing because of historical data. These entities have no headcount and had no movement in FY22:\n\n- Pernod Ricard USA Finance, Inc.; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard USA Bottling, LLC; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Overseas, Inc.; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Wyborowa SA; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Our Vodka; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Asia Japan Representative Office; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Euro Trade LTD. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe following entities were updated in FY22:\n\n- Creation of Mx; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- JDC Servicios Pernod Ricard M\u00e9xico SA de C.Va merged with glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Pernod Ricard M\u00e9xico SA de CV;\n- DOBRY WYB\u00d3R sp. z.o.o. s.k. merged with WYBOROWA SA glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Oddzial w Warszawie;\n- Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits d'Armagnac SAS sold in FY22 ; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- DIAB - first year of reporting; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Sub Saharan Africa merged into Pernod Ricard glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> SOUTH AFRICA PTY LTD;\n- Pernod Ricard Mozambique and Pernod Ricard Ghana Limited glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> started to report as separate entities. Previously, the data was included in South Central Africa for Mozambique and West Africa for Ghana;\n- Pernod Ricard Namibia Pty Ltd first year of reporting ; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- 8degrees new entity and not reporting yet ; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- The Kyoto Distillery KK new and not reporting yet ; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- Convivialite (Shanghai) Food Sale Co., Ltd: created as of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> 1 July 2022, will report next year.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Region includes the Asia distribution network and the Group's Wines business. This also includes the affiliates Bodegas Tarsus and Pernod Ricard Winemakers Spain, based in Spain, and Pernod Ricard Winemakers Kenwood and Pernod Ricard Winemakers Mumm Napa, based in the United States. A distinction is made between Brand Companies and Market Companies for Australia and New Zealand resulting in two entities for each country.\n\nPernod Ricard's African activities are managed by Pernod Ricard's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America Region and the related data are therefore included in the data for this Region.\n\nThe social reporting indicators are selected to provide the Group with a reliable and accurate picture of its global footprint. The data collected enables Pernod Ricard to be increasingly socially responsible in respect of its employees worldwide.\n\n## Scope of societal reporting\n\nFor Responsible Procurement related information, the scope covers the Packaging (Dry goods), Raw Material (Wet goods), and Point of sale material purchasing categories. Are excluded from this analysis: A&P (Advertising & Promotions), IT, Business Services, Travel, Co-packing and Manufacturting (incl. Logistics).\n\nThis perimeter also focuses only on 37 Pernod Ricard entities which are: Chivas, Corby, Global Travel Retail, Havana Club, Hiram Walkers And Sons, Irish Distillers, Jan Becher, Lillet, Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt, Pernod Ricard Argentina, Pernod Ricard Brasil, Pernod Ricard China, Pernod Ricard Deutschland, Pernod Ricard Espa\u00f1a, Pernod Ricard Finland, Pernod Ricard France, Pernod Ricard Hellas & Kam, Pernod Ricard HQ (for Group Preferred Suppliers only), Pernod Ricard India, Pernod Ricard Italia, Pernod Ricard Japan, Pernod Ricard Korea, Pernod Ricard Mexico, Pernod Ricard Portugal, Pernod Ricard Rouss, Pernod Ricard South Africa, Pernod Ricard Turkey, Pernod Ricard UK, Pernod Ricard USA, Pernod Ricard Winemakers Australia/New Zealand, Pernod Ricard Helan Mountain, Pernod Ricard Winemakers Spain, Pernod Ricard Winemakers USA, The Absolut Company, Ungava Spirits, Wyborowa/Pernod Ricard Poland and Yerevan Brand Company.\n\nThe other entities are excluded from this perimeter because they purchase low volumes of the above purchasing categories and do not have the dedicated Procurement resources to manage the spend.\n\nIndicators relating to responsible drinking are included in the social report. The indicators cover all Pernod Ricard subsidiaries (Brand Companies and Market Companies), which must provide their societal information in the social reporting. When several subsidiaries are located in the same country, the implementation of the S&R strategy and the associated action plans may be carried out by a single subsidiary.",

        "page_content": "## Scope of environmental reporting\n\nPernod Ricard's environmental reporting relates to production sites under the Group's operational control on 30 June in the financial year in question and operational throughout the year. It does not cover administrative sites (head offices or sales offices) or logistics warehouses located outside industrial sites (only involves a few isolated warehouses). This is because their environmental impact is not significant compared to those within industrial sites. It also covers the agricultural supply chain.\n\nThe FY22 reporting covers 87 industrial sites. This figure is lower than in FY21 following the closure of one production site & reclassification of another production sites (1) . The industrial scope for this financial year therefore covers:\n\n- a production volume of 1,140 million litres (finished products glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> either bottled or in bulk), compared with 1,035 million in FY21; and\n- a volume of distilled alcohol of 287 million litres in FY22, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> compared with 244 million litres in FY21.\n\n## Clarification on indicators 3.6.1.2\n\n## Social indicators\n\nAverage headcount is calculated in terms of full-time equivalents, without taking account of short-term employee absences. Long-term absences involving contract suspensions are reflected in the calculation of the FTE.\n\nSince FY19, employees are included in the headcount of the legal entity with which they have an employment contract. Expatriates and seconded employees are included in the headcount of their host affiliates.\n\nPernod Ricard China employees are accounted for as staff on permanent contracts. Chinese employment contracts have a statutory term and are only converted into permanent contracts after a number of years. However, given the specific characteristics of employment legislation in China, Pernod Ricard considers its employees to be permanent staff. Due to the particular characteristics of local labour laws, as of last year the same rule applies to Pernod Ricard Minsk employees, as the concept of fixed-term contract does not exist in Belarus.\n\nWork-study contracts (apprenticeship contracts and training contracts) are not counted as fixed-term contracts. This also applies to work placement students, temporary workers and VIE programme volunteers.\n\nThe absenteeism rate is calculated based on the theoretical number of hours and working days worked per year. Maternity/paternity/parental leaves are included in the absenteeism rate.\n\nSince FY21, the calculation for lost time accident severity & frequency rates evolved to follow a more commonly used method and make the indicators easier to understand. The number of accidents and subsequent calendar days lost are now set against the annual full time equivalent for both employees & interim workers, and no longer the number of days theoretically worked during the year.\n\nAdditionally, and in line with the Group H&S policy, newly acquired companies are only included in their second full fiscal year for:\n\n- frequency/severity rates for workplace accidents; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- number with lost time; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- number of fatalities. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nCommuting accidents are not included in accident numbers. They are thus not used to calculate frequency and severity rates.\n\nIt should be noted that 'daily contract' data are included as long as available; any days lost after the contract termination are not included.\n\nDoubtful cases of lost-time accidents are requested to be reported by each affiliate and are reviewed quarterly by a H&S Committee composed of HQ H&S Director and manager, Brand Co QSE managers and QSE managers (or H&S coordinators) of each site requesting that a case be reviewed. Exclusion of doubtful cases can be decided when the work-relatedness is excluded and based on the H&S reporting protocol rules.\n\nTraining hours rules have been harmonised:\n\n- when available, actual hours will be used; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- when the hours are not available/tracked ( e.g. for some glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> e-learning) 1hr will be used by default.\n\nFor the training salaries costs, where detailed data was not available, a formula was introduced: total gross salary = number of hours \u00d7 (UTC + DTC)/(FTE \u00d7 theoretical yearly hours per FTE).\n\nHeadcount and FTE calculations consider employees leaving the Group on the last day of the fiscal year as active. The related termination events are then included in the next fiscal year to calculate departure rates & turnover.\n\nOne indicator was corrected: initially, in the 'Representation of Women at 30 June (Permanent Contracts)' table, Group headcount for FY21 had been reported at 6,952 and was corrected to 6,592.\n\nThe definition for the 'Top Management' classification was reviewed and reclarified following the FY19 publication. This classification reflects the employees from COMEX to Band C job levels.\n\nThe number of bartenders and bar owners trained to the Bar World of Tomorrow (BWOT) correspond to the total consolidated number of training sessions completed, since the official launch in 2020.\n\n## Societal indicators\n\nRegarding Responsible Procurement information, the global data are extracted from Partner Up tool. There are some exceptions: some suppliers from the following countries are excluded from Partner Up platform because the tool is not fully deployed in these countries: China, Brazil (for Brazil, only non-Brazilian third parties are created on Partner Up), Taiwan, South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Cuba. In this case, the list of suppliers is reported manually to Pernod Ricard Headquarters via and Excel sheet report.\n\nRegarding the calculated indicators: only active suppliers are considered (active supplier: doing business with Pernod Ricard for the last two years; beyond two years and without any activity, the supplier is considered inactive):\n\n- having signed the Supplier Standards: number of active 1. suppliers who have signed the Supplier Standards (using Partner Up or outside Partner Up);\n- analysed using the Risk Mapping tool: number of active 2. suppliers who have been analysed by the Risk Mapping Tool (using Partner Up or outside Partner Up);\n\n3.",

(Ecovadis, SMETA) but who did not start to implement the required mitigation plan: number of active suppliers, identified as risky, following an external assessment/audit (Ecovadis, SMETA) who require to start a mitigation plan (a plan to correct the non-conformities).\n\nFor the two last indicators, the methodology has been updated. In January 2022, the Group stopped its membership of the AIM Progress initiative and decided to extend the scope of social and ethical audits to other standards such as the Sustainable Winegrowing Accreditation (SWA).\n\n## Environmental indicators\n\nThe Group footprint on agricultural land is assessed by the areas on which purchased agricultural raw materials are used. These equivalent areas are estimated on the basis of the agricultural yields of the various materials used by the Group (1) . For transformed products, industrial yields are used to assess the quantity of agricultural materials purchased.\n\nSite environmental performance is expressed using various ratios. These depend on the business category used by the Group to classify sites:\n\n- distilleries: data broken down by volumes of pure distilled glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> alcohol;\n- bottling sites: data broken down by volumes of bottled glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> finished products;\n- wineries: data broken down by volumes made into wine; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- vineyards: data broken down by surface area cultivated with glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> vines.\n\nAt Group level, consolidated performance is expressed based either on:\n\n- the amount of distilled alcohol for environmental impact glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> primarily due to distillation ( e.g. , water or energy consumption), expressed in units per thousand litres of pure distilled alcohol (kl PA);\n- the bottled volume or the volume of finished products glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> manufactured (including products delivered in bulk) when bottling or production is the main source of impact (such as in the case of solid waste), expressed in units per thousand litres (kl);\n- the number of hectares occupied by vineyards for glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> agricultural properties, expressed in units per hectare (ha).\n\nFor industrial sites, this distinction is sometimes complex, as some sites have several activities. As such, since the time frames involved in bottling may sometimes differ widely from those for distilling (aged spirits: whiskies, cognac, etc.), these figures may be difficult to interpret from year to year. Both calculation methods are therefore presented for some indicators.\n\nSetting overall Group quantitative targets for the quantity of water or energy consumed per unit produced, for example, becomes complex as the consolidation of targets depends on the business mix during the year and the consolidated indicator chosen. For that reason, the performance captured by indicators should be used with care and interpreted over the long-term. Where a significant reporting error from previous periods is identified, historical data is only readjusted if the impact on Group performance is over 1%. This is to allow for a better interpretation of results and trends.\n\nThe definitions for 'renewable energy consumption' and 'renewable electricity consumption' were reviewed following the FY19 publication to come into line with RE100 requirements. Since FY20:\n\n- total renewable electricity consumption is calculated using glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the portion covered by green or renewable energy certificates plus renewable electricity produced and used on site;\n- total renewable energy consumption is calculated using total glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> renewable electricity consumption plus other renewable energy used on site (biogas, biofuel, etc.).\n\nThe Water Risk Assessment is done using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The Internal Water Risk Index (IWRI) is calculated based on the blended rating from three Aqueduct indicators:\n\n- overall Water Risk; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- baseline Water Stress; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- baseline Water Stress - 2030 projected using a 'Business as glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Usual' scenario.\n\nThree water risk levels are defined as a result of 'Internal Water Risk Index' analysis:\n\n- extremely high-risk, sites with an IWRI of over 4; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- high-risk, sites with an IWRI between 3 and 4; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- medium-risk, sites with an IWRI between 2 and 3; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- low-risk, sites with an IWRI under 2. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nSites from the top two risk levels ( i.e. , 3 or higher) are required to replenish their water consumption through water projects. Dedicated co-packers only include bottling process activities with at least 90% of production volume relating to Pernod Ricard. The water quantities replenished through projects in place are consolidated at country-level and for watersheds with the same level of risk.\n\nConcerning the Group carbon footprint calculation, both location-based and market-based energy emissions are calculated, although Scopes 1 and 2 calculations only take market-based emissions into account. The location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs; the market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen, and derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.",

        "page_content": "Carbon emissions data for the FY18 baseline for POS materials were used taking FY21 figures with revised calculation methodology, as data availability and accuracy significantly improved in FY21. In FY22, POS emissions calculation methodology was revised again for data reliability purposes.\n\nLastly, the Group is developing calculators with its suppliers and encouraging them to conduct Life Cycle Analysis in order to progressively replace their generic emission factors with specific ones, thus allowing for finer CO2 emissions calculation.\n\n## EU taxonomy indicators\n\nFor the turnover, while the Group's activity of ticketing for brand homes is within the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation in relation to the achievement of the climate objectives, the associated revenues are immaterial and are excluded from the reporting of Taxonomy-eligibility (less than 1% of the 2022 consolidated turnover).\n\nRegarding capital expenditures (Capex), an eligibility analysis has been conducted for Pernod-Ricard's business units, covering over 75% of Pernod-Ricard's Capex. This analysis was extrapolated to estimate the full scope. Note that Pernod Ricard warehouse Capex is deemed not eligible to be included as alignment criteria for real estate activities are not applicable to these investments.\n\nTaxonomy Regulation states that where the Opex is non-material for the business model of the company, it shall be exempted from the calculation of the numerator of Opex KPI and disclose that numerator as being equal to zero. The calculation of the Opex as defined by the Taxonomy has been based on the identification and calculation of R&D, short-term rentals and maintenance and repairs expenses, including R&D workforce costs. Opex (as defined by the regulation) are deemed immaterial as they represent less than 5% of Pernod-Ricard total Opex. The company is therefore exempt from the calculation of the numerator and its Opex KPI is nil.\n\n## Data collection, consolidation 3.6.1.3 and monitoring\n\n## Data collection methods\n\nTo ensure the standardisation and reliability of results, non-financial indicators are formalised in reporting procedures. This includes specific definitions for each indicator, which are passed on to all Managers involved in collecting and consolidating data.\n\nPernod Ricard constantly seeks to improve the collection and analysis of its data. It accordingly updates its procedures and user guide annually in line with the Group's evolving needs. Improvements are made to ensure compliance with:\n\n- the requirements of the decree implementing article 225 on glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> corporate transparency obligations on social and environmental matters; and\n- in accordance with applicable national or international glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> frameworks.\n\nUpdates also result from contributions from affiliates when reporting data and auditor feedback. Any changes from the previous year are highlighted.\n\nFor Health & Safety Lost Time accident reporting, a new tool called Intelex has been implemented for FY22 for affiliates to register their accidents. For number of accidents, number of days, frequency and severity rate, the source of the figures is Intelex.\n\nFor environmental indicators, this same tool was launched to collect data from FY22.\n\nFor EU Taxonomy indicators, this initial reporting exercise has been led jointly by the Finance and CSR teams at the Group and affiliate levels, mobilising Sustainability, Finance, Operations and Purchasing Departments. The main interpretations used to roll out this regulation are mentioned in the following section. The detailed reporting protocol is available on request from Pernod Ricard's head office.\n\n## Methods for consolidating and checking data\n\nOnce submitted by entities, data is compiled at management entity level, then at Region or Brand level for submission to Headquarters. The data is processed and consolidated at each level. Each entity collecting and compiling data is responsible for the indicators reported and certifies the data as well as the checks done.\n\nThis control is facilitated by automatic checks within the data entry tool in the consolidation documents sent to the Regions or Brands and in the consolidation tool. Amongst other things, these include consistency checks against previous years and between the indicators themselves. For social indicators, at each step the affiliates can explain any variations versus the previous financial year. For variations of 10% or more, a comment is required to facilitate understanding and tracking.\n\nOnce all the data have been collected, Headquarters performs consistency checks to identify any reporting or input errors. When there are significant variations, the Group checks with the affiliates to ensure the data is valid. Finally, Headquarters consolidates these data.\n\nRegarding the EU Taxonomy, Pernod Ricard has ensured that there is no double counting in the calculation of turnover, Capex and Opex KPIs across activities as directly allocable turnover, Capex and Opex are considered.\n\n3.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nTo the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Pernod Ricard (hereinafter the 'Company'), appointed as independent third party ('third party') and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Cofrac), under number 3-1886 r\u00e9v. 0 (Cofrac Inspection Accreditation, scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial performance statement, prepared in accordance with the Company's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended 30 June 2022 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement', respectively), presented in the Group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our procedures as described in the section 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, no material misstatements have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial performance statement does not comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly, the Information must be read and interpreted with reference to the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement and available on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the information relating to the Statement\n\nAs stated in the Declaration, the Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the methodological note of the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nManagement is responsible for:\n\n- selecting or determining the appropriate criteria for the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> preparation of the Information;\n- preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented with respect to these risks as well as the outcomes of these policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n\n- implementing such internal control as it determines is glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by applying the Company's Guidelines as referred to above.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the 'Information.'\n\nAs it is our responsibility to issue an independent conclusion on the information prepared by management, we are not authorised to participate in the preparation of the Information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to provide a conclusion on:\n\n- the Company's compliance with other applicable legal and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the duty of vigilance and the fight against corruption and tax evasion);\n- the fairness of information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> regulations.\n\n## Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with our audit verification programme in application of Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised - Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information).\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nOur independence is defined by Article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ). In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement.",

We conducted more than twenty interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\nThis work involved the use of information and communication technologies allowing the work and interviews to be carried out remotely, without hindering the good execution of the verification process.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures conducted in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- We familiarized ourselves with the activities of all companies glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> in the consolidation scope and the description of the principal risks.\n- We assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector.\n- We verified that the Statement covers each category of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> information stipulated in section III of Article L. 225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n- We verified that the Statement provides the information glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n- We verified that the Statement presents the business model glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and a description of the principal risks associated with the activities of all the consolidated entities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks.\n\n- We referred to documentary sources and conducted glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> interviews to:\n- assess the process used to identify and confirm the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented; and\n- corroborate the qualitative information (measures and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> outcomes) that we considered to be the most important (1) ; for certain information, (Alcohol in society, Responsible supply chains), our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, while for other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n- We verified that the Statement covers the consolidated glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16, with the limits specified in the Statement.\n- We obtained an understanding of internal control and risk glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> management procedures implemented by the Company and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information.\n- For the key performance indicators and other quantitative glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> outcomes (2) that we considered to be the most important, we implemented:\n- analytical procedures that consisted in verifying the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> correct consolidation of collected data as well as the consistency of changes thereto;\n- substantive tests, on a sample basis and using other glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> selection methods, that consisted in verifying the proper application of definitions and procedures and reconciling data with supporting documents. These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities (3) and covered between 10% and 49% of the consolidated data selected for these tests.\n- We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> relation to our knowledge of the entire Company.\n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less in scope than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, September 20, 2022 One of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nMarc de Villartay\n\nPartner, Audit\n\nJulien Rivals\n\nPartner, Sustainability Services\n\n- Selected qualitative information: see Appendix.

As with all control systems, they cannot however provide an absolute guarantee that such risks have been fully eliminated.\n\n## Description of the internal 4.1.2 control environment\n\n## Components of the internal control 4.1.2.1 system\n\nThe principal bodies responsible for internal control are as follows:\n\n## At Group level\n\n- The Executive Board is the permanent coordination body for glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the management of the Group;\n- The Executive Committee ensures that the Group's glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> operations are carried out properly and that its main policies are applied;\n- The Internal Audit Department works under the Group glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Chairman and CEO and reports to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The internal audit team based at Headquarters is in charge of implementing the audit plan, with the support of the audit teams in the Regions. The audit plan is drawn up once the Group's main risks have been identified and analysed. It is validated by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. It presents various cross-disciplinary issues that will be reviewed during the financial year, the list of affiliates that will be audited, and the main topics to be covered during the audits. The conclusions are then submitted to the Audit Committee, Executive Board and Statutory Auditors for examination and analysis; and\n- External Auditors : the Board of Directors selects the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Statutory Auditors to be proposed at the General Meeting on the basis of recommendations from the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Group has selected Statutory Auditors who are able to provide comprehensive worldwide coverage of Group risks.\n\n## At affiliate level\n\nThe Management Committee is appointed by Headquarters or the relevant Region and is composed of the affiliate's Chairman and CEO and of the Directors of its main functions. The Management Committee is responsible for managing the main risks that could affect the affiliate.\n\nThe affiliate's Chief Financial Officer , assisted in most cases by an internal controller, is tasked by the Managing Director of the affiliate with establishing appropriate internal control systems for the prevention and control of risks arising from the affiliate's operations, in particular, accounting and finance risks, including error or fraud.\n\n## Identification and management of risks 4.1.2.2\n\nDuring FY22, the Group focused on:\n\n- a review of the Group's risk mapping involving Senior glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Management and the Audit Committee. This annual review takes into account the major changes in the risk environment to which the Pernod Ricard Group is exposed;\n- strengthening internal control within the Group, using various glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> approaches, including the continued development of data analytics to strengthen auditing methods;\n- implementing the self-assessment questionnaire on internal glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> control and risk management. This questionnaire, which was updated during the financial year, complies with the French Financial Market Authority (AMF) reference framework for risk management and internal control, as does its application guide, itself updated in July 2010; and\n- performing audits: 27 internal audits were conducted in FY22. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> The purpose of these audits was to ensure that the Group's internal control principles were properly applied in its affiliates. They also allowed to review the processes in place, best practices and potential areas for improvement on various cross-cutting themes. Unlike in FY21, this year the teams were able to return to the field to carry out the majority of audit assignments.\n\nAll of the key areas for improvement identified were addressed in specific action plans drawn up at every affiliate and at Group level, which were validated by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Their implementation is regularly monitored and assessed by the Group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe work performed resulted in an improvement of the quality of internal control and risk management to improve within the Group.",

In particular, it covers corporate governance practices, operational activities and IT support. Submitted to the Group's affiliates, it enables them to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal controls. Responses to the questionnaires are documented and reviewed by the Regions and the Group's Internal Audit Department. This work is detailed in:\n\n- a summary by affiliate and an overall Group summary, both of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> which are provided to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee; and\n- a letter of representation from every affiliate to the Chairman glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and CEO of its Parent Company and a letter of representation from the various parent companies to the Chairman and CEO of Pernod Ricard. This letter is binding on the affiliates' management with regard to the adequacy of their control procedures in light of identified risks.\n\nThe Internal Audit Charter applies to all employees who have a management and audit position. It defines the standards, tasks, responsibilities and organisation of the Group's Internal Audit Department and the way in which it operates, in order to remind every employee to strive for compliance with and improvement of the internal control process.\n\nThe Pernod Ricard Quality, Safety and Environment Standards set out the rules to be followed in these areas. The Group's Operations Department is responsible for ensuring that they are followed.\n\nBudget control focuses on three key areas: the annual budget (reforecast several times during the year), monthly performance reporting and the strategic plan. Budget control is exercised by management control teams attached to the Finance Departments at Headquarters, in Regions and in affiliates. It operates as follows:\n\n- the budget is subject to specific instructions (principles and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> timetable) published by Headquarters and sent to all affiliates. The final budget is approved by the Group's Executive Board;\n- reporting is prepared on the basis of data input directly by glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> affiliates working to a specific timetable provided at the beginning of the year and in accordance with the reporting manual and the accounting principles published by Headquarters;\n- monthly performance analysis is carried out as part of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> reporting process and is presented by the Finance Department to the Executive Board, the Executive Committee and at Meetings of the Audit Committee and Board of Directors;\n- a multi-year strategic plan is established for the Group's main glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> brands every three years; and\n- a single management and consolidation system allows each glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> affiliate to directly input all its accounting and financial data.\n\nCentralised treasury management is led by the Treasury Unit of the Group's Finance Department.\n\n## Headquarters' legal and operational 4.1.2.4 control over affiliates\n\nAffiliates are mostly wholly owned, either directly or indirectly, by Pernod Ricard.\n\nPernod Ricard is represented directly or indirectly (through an intermediate affiliate) on its affiliates' Boards of Directors.\n\nThe Group's internal control principles lay down the various internal control rules applicable to all affiliates.\n\nThe role assigned to Pernod Ricard, as described in the subsection on 'Decentralised organisation' in Section 1 'Presentation of Pernod Ricard' of this universal registration document, is an important component of the control of affiliates.\n\n4.",

However, Pernod Ricard has put in place a crisis management organisation and mechanisms to better control the effects of the crisis and ensure the continuity of its operations at industrial and logistics levels throughout the world, as well as maintain dynamic management of its activity (including the management of its resources) in a very uncertain context depending on the country.\n\nThus, in such a context, the in-depth review carried out on the risk mapping in 2021, an exercise to identify the Group's risks, made it possible to highlight the Group's resilience in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic while influencing the redefinition of the contours of the main risks and their management.\n\nIn addition, in 2022, a new review of the mapping was carried out by the Internal Audit Department and submitted to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee in order to adapt the risks to the current context in which the Group operates.\n\nThis mapping is reproduced below to provide a visual representation of the issues, without replacing the explanatory text that follows. The different risks are classified according to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This risk mapping reflects Pernod Ricard's exposure and takes into account the control measures in place to limit the probability and impact. This mapping is reviewed annually to take into account major changes in the risk environment facing the Pernod Ricard Group.\n\nLIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHIGH",

Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue to its international scope, the Pernod Ricard Group is exposed to the risks of geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic instabilities.\n\nThe acceleration of international tensions observed in recent years may lead to an increase in customs barriers or international sanctions, as was the case in the context of the trade war between the United States and China, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other hand, as well as the adoption of Western sanctions against Russia following the war in Ukraine. In addition, the global sanitary crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the risk of the resurgence of a global macroeconomic crisis and social unrest.\n\nThese geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions in the Group's markets could lead to heightened volatility in Pernod Ricard's commercial and financial results. For Russia and Ukraine specifically, these markets represented c. 3% of the Group's worldwide net sales before the conflict. The economic and legal consequences of the war could significantly hamper\n\nthis stream of business. Macroeconomic instability and, in particular, potential constraints on consumer purchasing power, may have a negative impact on consumption opportunities and the Group's sales. Sustained geopolitical tensions could also lead to difficulties in accessing certain markets. These economic crises and trade tensions could weigh on the\n\nGroup's operating margin.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nFor the Group, the best way to protect itself is to diversify its activities, both geographically and by category: it is present in 74 countries and has a leading brand in all major spirit categories. Pernod Ricard continues to develop new distribution channels (e-commerce, home entertainment) and to exploit new consumption opportunities, such as the 'low/no alcohol' trend. Accordingly, the Group regularly reassesses its routes-to-market and local partners. Pernod Ricard also closely monitors political and regulatory changes to anticipate disruptions to its activities as far as possible. In addition, crisis management programmes are in place in all affiliates. Finally, under certain circumstances, production and logistics infrastructures can be adapted.\n\n## 2. Pressure on prices and margins\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe concentration and consolidation of distributors both locally and internationally has been ongoing for several years. E-commerce is also becoming an increasingly important alternative to traditional distribution channels. This competitive environment affects the Group's ability to increase its prices and may sometimes force Pernod Ricard to organise more aggressive and frequent promotional campaigns.\n\nThe Group also faces heightened competition from both major international players on its strategic brands and local groups or producers on its local brands, driven by the increasing success\n\nof craft products, as is the case with vodka in the United States. Lastly, purchase price inflation (materials, services), which is particularly high in this context, is closely monitored by The Group in order to limit pressure on margins.\n\nPotential impacts include:\n\n- the increased bargaining power of Pernod Ricard's customers glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> leading to margin erosion and/or loss of market share;\n- temporary delisting of products on shelves and/or removal glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of promotional materials;\n- pressure on Pernod Ricard to align prices across markets glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> within a region;\n- the more intense competition in mature markets and the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> increasingly competitive nature of emerging markets, requiring the Group to boost its advertising and promotional investments, or even to reduce or freeze prices in order to protect market share, thereby weighing on results;\n- damage to the brand image of products, resulting from price glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> reductions; and\n- a decrease in margins due to a deterioration in purchasing glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> conditions from the Group's suppliers and/or a limited ability to reflect cost increases in the price of its products.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, Pernod Ricard earmarks approximately 16% of net sales for A&P investments to reinforce brand equity and, in turn, the ability to increase prices. In addition, Pernod Ricard has rolled out several initiatives to increase net sales (Revenue Growth Management), such as the development of a promotional effectiveness tool, the analysis of commercial conditions and pricing structures, and the implementation of dedicated pricing resources. These initiatives are adopted in the affiliates and coordinated at Group level by the Headquarters.\n\nParticular attention is paid to the operating margin, a key indicator monitored by the management control teams. The Group has put in place the appropriate organisations and initiatives to ensure satisfactory purchasing conditions for its raw materials while maintaining relationships of mutual trust with its key suppliers.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Significant cyberattack\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's digital transformation has brought with it greater exposure to risks stemming from cyberattacks, as well as those related to IT and telecommunications system failures. These systems are of inestimable importance to the Group's day-to-day operations, in particular regarding processing, transmission and storage of electronic data relating as much to the Group's operations and financial statements, as to the communication between Pernod Ricard's personnel, customers and suppliers. In addition, more stringent personal data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation, increase the risks associated with regulatory non-compliance.\n\nPotential impacts of a cyberattack and its effects depend on the nature of the attack, but could include:\n\n- leakage, loss, theft of personal, strategic or confidential data, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and the resulting chain of potential repercussions;\n- system failure; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- incapacity to perform day-to-day operations. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nAlthough the Group invests a significant amount in maintaining and safeguarding its IT systems, particularly in view of growing threats in terms of cybercriminality, any malfunctions, significant disruption, loss or disclosure of sensitive data could disrupt the normal course of business, and have financial, operational or reputational consequences.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has a comprehensive cybersecurity roadmap based on a dedicated governance model and we continually invest in further security resources across our technological and operational landscapes. The cybersecurity team reports to an Executive Committee specifically focused on the security of the Group and partners with top security firms.\n\nThe Group continues to strengthen its security posture of its infrastructure, applications, websites and networks. Infrastructure monitoring and management is performed constantly. IT and security audits are regularly performed to assess against best practices. In addition, awareness-raising campaigns are conducted on a regular basis. Lastly, tests are carried out on the recovery of the Group's IT systems following a hypothetical ransomware attack, and a plan has been designed to facilitate the recovery of data as efficiently as possible to minimize any potential disruption.\n\n## 4. Rapid changes in consumer behaviour\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nAccentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the trend in consumer behaviour has accelerated, in terms of product offerings (artisanal spirits, trend for little or no alcohol), purchasing preferences (e-commerce, fast delivery) or dialogue and brand experiences (digital marketing, cross-channel points of contact, etc.). Moreover, the current uncertain macroeconomic environment could lead to changes in consumer behaviour.\n\nPernod Ricard needs to adapt its organisation, portfolio, business model and market access routes to these new trends and continue to innovate, always placing the consumer at the centre of its decisions and marketing and commercial choices.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, Pernod Ricard acts across its entire organisation:\n\n- the Consumer Insights organisation studies and improves knowledge of consumer behaviour and societal changes in order to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> anticipate changes in trends. This was strengthened in 2019 by its centralisation and the creation of relays in the markets as well as by the intensification of social listening resources;\n- innovation hubs have been created in the regions to develop products and services with high added value, both for the Group and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> for its consumers and users. In addition, an agile TLO experimentation method (Test, Learn, Optimise) has been set up;\n- from a strategic standpoint, the diversification of the business model, market access methods and portfolio management are closely glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> monitored and changes deemed relevant are implemented. For example, the Group entered the direct-to-consumer sales channel with the launch of Drinks&Co, a brand bringing together an online marketplace and physical stores. Moreover, the creation of Conviviality Ventures in 2017 also makes it possible to invest indirectly in new activities that complement those of Pernod Ricard by benefiting from the rich and innovative start-up ecosystem; and\n- finally, the Group continues its in-depth digital transformation. The six transformation priorities have been brought together in Key glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Digital Programmes. They make it possible to continuously improve the effectiveness of marketing and sales processes and to identify the maximum opportunities in the relationships that are established with the various partners through incubated programmes. These programmes are based on the in-depth exploitation of data and the latest available technologies such as machine learning algorithms.\n\nDifficulties in detecting and predicting future consumer behaviour could result in under-investment in categories, products and channels that turn out to be strong or conversely\n\nover-investment in those that are running out of steam.\n\nOver time, Pernod Ricard could lose market share or miss out on growth opportunities and damage its brand image and/or reputation.\n\n4.",

Talent development (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard's success depends on the commitment of its employees and its ability to attract and retain them as well as develop their skills, particularly in highly competitive labour markets, such as North America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, where turnover rates are normally higher than in the rest of the world. This competitive talent market is heightened by the search for scarce skills, changes in the aspirations of new generations and the pandemic impact that has accelerated certain trends. Moreover, employee development through geographic mobility is sometimes an issue (diversity of career paths, management of the partner's career, cost control, Covid impact, etc.).\n\nThe Group is aware that talent management must remain a key area of focus to ensure the sustainability of its activity and ensure the transmission of key know-how within the organisation. Excessively high turnover or unduly long job vacancies could have a financial impact and demotivate teams. This could potentially slow the implementation of key Group development projects and have an adverse impact on its business, results or reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, the Group established and embedded worldwide a robust global talent management strategic planning, fully leveraging technology and data, with a common language to assess performance and develop Talent & Performance. This together with a skills development framework and offer to grow Talent and facilitate dynamic career management. Accordingly, shared processes and tools have been developed to allow all affiliates to optimise the assessment of skills and performance, to formalise the identification of talents, to encourage internal mobility and to monitor employee engagement. Since 2019, a talent management process (Let's Talk Talent) powered by a global human capital management system, and a new global leadership model with expected behaviours at each level, has been put in place.\n\nShared by the whole Group, this global framework puts the employee at the centre of Human Resources processes and clarifies performance expectations, using a common language for everyone. Moreover, Pernod Ricard University trains the Group's future leaders through leadership and skills based development programmes. Succession plans are regularly reviewed by the Top Management, especially for key positions within the Group and annually Talent conversations meetings are conducted at the very top senior executive level to ensure Pernod Ricard have talents ready at the right time at the right place. Furthermore, from a talent engagement perspective, on a yearly basis the Group is conducting Global Employee Engagement Surveys. Lastly, measures are carried out regularly to improve quality of life at work. They include the facilitation of remote work, measures related to well-being at work, the modernisation of workspaces and managerial awareness-raising programmes.\n\n## 6. Negative media coverage\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe constant increase in the number of social networks, the speed of circulation of information and its influence, mean that Pernod Ricard could face the risk of being exposed to harmful media coverage and inappropriate publications or messages. Furthermore, the prolonged spread of misleading information in the media and in particular on social networks (fake news) has been observed in recent years. It cannot be ruled out that the Group could be affected by this type of action, which is difficult to control.\n\nA malicious attack aimed at harming Pernod Ricard's reputation or a genuine incident in relation to its brand portfolio could have a significant impact on the Group's image and reputation. Further widespread negative media coverage could jeopardise consumers' confidence in Pernod Ricard brands, resulting in a potential sales decline.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group's risk is managed through a series of internal and external measures. While internal measures focus primarily on raising the awareness of Pernod Ricard employees to the impact of social media and sharing best practices in terms of communication, external measures are used to monitor social networks.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Supply chain disruptions\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nWhile the global crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic has shown the resilience of the Pernod Ricard Group's supply chain, it has also shown that large-scale, unpredictable events could occur and render access to markets more complex. Other factors also remain relevant, such as the failure of a key supplier, the unavailability of certain raw materials (weather conditions, in particular) or the closure or impossibility of access to certain routes, whether sea or land. By way of illustration, a trend towards the concentration of suppliers of raw materials and packaging has been observed for a number of years. Today, many of the Group's affiliates work with the same suppliers, which creates risk-charged interdependence should one of them fail ( e.g. in the event of a major accident at one of their production sites).\n\nA breakdown in the supply chain could occur due to the unavailability of certain raw materials or packaging materials, causing production of some of the Group's products to be shut down.\n\nFurthermore, the unavailability of certain products on the shelves, for one or more of the reasons mentioned here, could result in penalties invoiced by the Group's customers for non-compliance with the commercial terms and conditions and service rates agreed between the parties.\n\nLastly, an unexpected rise in the cost of raw materials or packaging materials could significantly increase the Group's operating costs. As it is not certain that this increase can be offset by higher prices, the Group's results could be affected.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nAs part of the business continuity measures put in place for the Group's strategic brands, affiliates systematically identify supply alternatives whenever there is a risk of a single supplier. These alternatives are also tested to ensure the viability of these choices. In addition, to mitigate other scenarios taken into account in these business continuity plans (such as the loss of a storage site or transport difficulties), emergency stocks are planned and taken into account on a permanent basis in the supply and production decisions of Brand Companies and Market Companies.\n\nLastly, the reinforcement of the 'S&OP' process, supported by the rollout of IT tools, gives better visibility concerning future demand and associated supply plans. In this context, more detailed planning of needs - at the level of the Brand Companies in particular - makes it possible to secure supply volumes from key suppliers and facilitate allocation decisions for the various markets if necessary.\n\n## 8. Risks related to S&R challenges (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard places the responsibility and sustainability of its activities at the heart of its strategy and decisions. In this context, an ambitious roadmap for 2030, called Good Times From a Good Place, was rolled out in 2019. Structured around natural resources and key stakeholders for the Group, this strategy has four pillars ('Nurturing terroir', 'Valuing People', 'Circular Making' and 'Responsible Hosting'), with quantitative and qualitative objectives being defined for each of these.\n\nAll of these commitments represent real challenges that the Group is intent upon tackling, in line with its historical approach and the expectations of its stakeholders, in particular consumers, employees and shareholders.\n\nIn addition, in the current context, regulations related to CSR challenges are multiplying and may impose ambitious objectives on companies, which is liable to represent genuine challenges for the Group in terms of adaptation.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has built a solid governance around the issues of responsibility and sustainability. At the level of the Board of Directors, a CSR Committee ensures that Pernod Ricard's roadmap and commitments are monitored. In addition, at operational level, a steering Committee meets four times a year to ensure that the resources are put in place to achieve the objectives and new regulatory obligations. Furthermore, Pernod Ricard is setting up key partnerships to strengthen the implementation of the strategy, and endeavours to promote them publicly and to convert other players, so that regulations will not be necessary to address the subject in question. Finally, reporting and monitoring tools covering all indicators in all Group affiliates make it possible to verify the Group's progress and the alignment of all functions involved in achieving these goals.\n\nFailure to meet these objectives or the occurrence of an event in conflict with our commitments (such as an industrial accident) would damage the credibility and reputation that the Group has built up over recent years with its stakeholders, in addition to the direct consequences.\n\nIn addition, stricter regulations on CSR challenges could have the effect of mitigating, or even nullifying, the Group's ambitions to voluntarily minimise the negative consequences of its activity. The resulting new regulatory obligations could be more difficult for the Group to fulfil.\n\n4.",

Fraud\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is exposed to the risk of fraud, in particular due to its presence in many countries, the acceleration of its digitisation and the development of potential threats.\n\nWhether fraud is internal or external, any type of occurrence could lead to financial losses (including legal costs to recover defrauded sums or products), leakage of sensitive information or theft of major physical assets. It could also have a significant impact on the Group's reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Pernod Ricard Group has implemented training measures ( e.g. the online course on internal control) to raise fraud awareness among Pernod Ricard employees. In addition, a strong internal control framework - relying on the Group internal control principles and related tools - has been set up across the Group to limit the risk of occurrence. Further, the Group conducts internal and external audits each year to ensure the effectiveness of measures in place.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks II.\n\n## 1. Loss of a major industrial site/strategic inventory\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nToday, the main identified causes that could result in the loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory are:\n\n- a fire and/or explosion related to the manufacture and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> handling of flammable products ( e.g. alcohol);\n- a natural catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> flood; and\n- a malicious act. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nSeveral Group sites are located in seismic zones, particularly in NewZealand, Armenia, California and Mexico.\n\nCertain sites, including the San Jos\u00e9 plant in Cuba, are exposed to risk of cyclones.\n\nLastly, the Group has significant stock of maturing products, such as Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, cognac, rum, brandy and wines, which are highly flammable.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo manage this risk, an Operations Risk Manager reporting to the Operations Department is responsible for coordinating the actions of affiliates in the implementation of preventive measures (design and maintenance of facilities, training, operating procedures, etc.) and physical protection mechanisms (automatic extinguishing, retention basins, emergency procedures, etc.). In cooperation with the insurer, more than 40 industrial sites are reviewed each year, resulting in an appraisal of the quality of risk,\n\nand as such, recommendations for improvement for each.\n\nIn addition, a Group monitoring programme for business continuity and management systems is in place. Strategic affiliates have identified the various scenarios that could affect their operations and have drawn up business continuity plans including the implementation of emergency solutions and access to alternative means of production in the event of the loss of a site.\n\nThe loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory is considered a major risk for Pernod Ricard. The materialisation of this risk could result in a significant operating loss and as such a sharp drop or prolonged interruption in the supply of certain products, thereby preventing the Group from meeting consumer demand.\n\nMoreover, an incident at one of the sites, whether accidental or the result of a malicious act, could jeopardise the safety of Group employees or could cause environmental damage.",

Toxic contamination (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group purchases most raw materials (grapes, cereals, agave, etc.) used in the manufacture of its wines & spirits from farmers or industrial producers (alcohol, sugar, flavourings, etc.). The presence of undesirable substances in these raw materials or a defect in the distillation, fermentation or bottling process could result in the presence of chemical (contaminant), biological (microorganism), physical (foreign body) or allergen contamination.\n\nThe Group's reputation and image may be undermined at any time by one-off incidents at an industrial facility or relating to a specific product. For example, contamination, whether arising accidentally, or through an act of malice, could cause injury or intoxication to a consumer, thereby exposing the Group to litigation and causing reputational harm to brands.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented protection and control systems to limit the risk of contamination. The control of this risk is based both on the application of the HACCP method, which aims at identifying the risks involved in the manufacturing process and to bring them under control, as well as on the implementation of specific internal guidelines. This approach is also accompanied by the implementation of management systems compliant with the ISO 22000 standard for food safety management, which is aimed specifically at controlling such risk.\n\nAn operation to analyse contaminants, covering all Strategic International Brands and the most important Strategic Local Brands, is periodically conducted by the Group's head office. It consists of an array of chemical analyses covering all the contaminants considered possible, and involves detection testing for around 40 unwanted molecules plus several hundred pesticides.\n\n4.",

On the other hand, potential damage could be caused by Pernod Ricard (CO2 emissions, accidental pollution). | POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP Increasingly irregular crop yields, climate events such as frost, hail and drought and shifting climatic boundaries can affect the quality, availability and, to a greater extent, the price of raw materials. Where grains or sugar cane are concerned, this effect, coupled with rising global demand, is contributing to increasing market price volatility, which must be taken into account in procurement strategies and business supply models. As regards grapes - another of the Group's key raw materials - climate models point to a trend showing an increase in the alcohol content in wine and champagne, adjustments to certain qualitative parameters and changes in phytosanitary pressure, as well as the risks of frost or drought, which vary depending on |\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nFor grapes, the relevant inter-professional organisations, such as those for cognac and champagne and the corresponding organisations for wine in Australia and New Zealand, have incorporated this issue into their research programmes in order to adapt their practices to the changes (choice of grape varieties, vine training, vinification, etc.).\n\nThe availability and quality of water at the production sites are key factors in ensuring the quality of Pernod Ricard's products and are monitored very closely. Responsible water management is a significant component of the Group's CSR policy: each site has to ensure that the use of groundwater or river water and the release of wastewater back into the environment do not harm nature. Sites located in areas identified as high risk in terms of water supply are subject to enhanced monitoring so as to ensure the sustainability of resources used by minimising water consumption and recharging the equivalent volume of water in the same area from which it is taken.\n\nAs for the financial impact related to CO2 emissions generated directly by the Group's activities or indirectly by its suppliers, a CO2 emission reduction plan has been put in place, aligned with a scenario of less than 2\u00b0C.\n\nIn addition, Pernod Ricard's impact on the climate was taken into account in the definition of the 'Preserve to share' roadmap. In concrete terms, the 'Nurturing terroir' and 'Circular Making' pillars involve the Company in the following areas:\n\n- regenerative agriculture: by 2025, pilot regenerative agriculture programmes will be developed by the Group for vineyards in eight glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> wine-growing regions - Argentina, California, the Cognac region, Champagne, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and China - aiming to improve the quality of soils and ecosystems. Identical initiatives are under way for the Group's other major strategic raw materials to increase the resilience of agricultural systems. These programmes are also a remarkable opportunity to create carbon sinks through soil sequestration and to have a positive impact on the climate;\n- packaging (2) : as part of its commitment to reduce its scope 3 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (2018 being the reference year), the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Group is working to reduce packaging and commits its suppliers to decarbonising their activities. Pilots are conducted to test alternative distribution methods for products without primary packaging. Single-use plastic promotional items are eliminated; and\n- the balance of water resources and the carbon footprint: by 2030, offset of 100% of the consumption of production sites located in glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> watersheds under high water stress, by replenishing water resources in these regions, and a 50% reduction in the carbon intensity of the Group's activities, in line with the Science-Based Targets initiative.",

Personal health and safety (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPreventing and managing occupational risks is something the Company owes its employees.\n\nThe notion of 'occupational risk' can be defined as all threats to the health of employees encountered in the context of their professional activity. They may result in an accident or a so-called 'occupational' illness. A non-exhaustive list of occupational risks\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to preventing is as follows:\n\n- risks relating to falls and slips; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- risks relating to noise and vibrations; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- electrical risk; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- fire and explosion risk; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- road risk; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- risks relating to the use of certain machines or work glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> equipment; and\n- psychosocial risks. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nIn addition to these traditional risks related to the industrial environment and work in a company, the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected the physical and mental health of Group employees. Despite the implementation of demanding health protocols and the compliance with isolation and quarantine measures, some employees contracted the disease. In addition, repeated lockdowns and prolonged periods of work from home have created disruption to social links and affected the work-life balance.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has embarked on a process to reduce occupational accidents by launching a comprehensive inventory of industrial sites with the greatest potential for improvement at the end of 2017. The main sites are now assessed by an external company in accordance with specific criteria in terms of both the safety culture and the ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) management system.\n\nThanks to this inventory and the commitment of Senior Management, the Group announced its ambition to become the leader in the Wine & Spirits sector in terms of Health and Safety by 2025, which resulted in a programme called Taking care of each other, comprising the following three strategic areas:\n\n- develop a culture where safety is central to the Group's values of conviviality; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- engage, motivate and empower all employees and subcontractors on the issue of safety; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- improve our operational efficiency through excellence in Health and Safety. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThis programme, which is closely monitored by the Group's Top Management, is part of the Group's CSR strategy and has gradually been extended to all affiliates.\n\nFinally, the protection of the Health and Safety of its employees lies at the heart of the Group's decisions by rigorously applying the recommendations of local authorities and those of the World Health Organization. Several initiatives have been put in place, in affiliates and at head office, to prevent psychosocial risks linked to prolonged isolation in the context of a pandemic, such as:\n\n- dedicated mental health hotlines; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- partnerships with medical centres; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- virtual moments of conviviality through fun activities (dancing, cooking); and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- strict rules regarding over-connection and meeting and working hours. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nPersonal injury is one of the main potential impacts for the Group.\n\nThe most serious potential impacts are:\n\n- the death of one or more employees, subcontractors, visitors glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> or other third parties;\n- permanent disability of employees, subcontractors, visitors or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> other third parties; and\n- occupational illness. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nReputational impact related to inadequate management of working conditions must also be taken into account.\n\nThe active and widespread circulation of a virus such as Covid-19 could lead to repeated absences due to illness, the implementation of home working measures or the temporary stoppage of certain sites leading to potential production losses for the Group.",

Business ethics (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is a decentralised company, established in many countries whose anti-corruption laws may have an extraterritorial impact.\n\nExamples include the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act or France's Sapin II law. The Group is thus required to take into account and rigorously monitor the risk of corruption and influence peddling, as well as to ensure such risks are taken into account in all relevant legal systems, in all regions of the world in which it operates.\n\nMoreover, Company employees interact, even to a marginal extent, with political and administrative officials. The nature of Pernod Ricard's business, whose motto is 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9', means that inappropriate invitations may be sent to persons with public authority.\n\nRecent regulations concerning the fight against corruption, influence peddling and compliance with business ethics expose Pernod Ricard to the risk of administrative and criminal sanctions, as well as a reputational risk in the event of non-compliance.\n\nIn addition, certain corrupt practices, consisting in offering undue, excessive and/or inappropriate benefits, even without deliberate intention to obtain an undue advantage, are severely punished by the anti-corruption laws of three of the main countries in which the Group operates and provide for the criminal liability of the legal entities and natural and moral persons involved, accompanied in particular by heavy financial penalties for the Company as well as for the perpetrators of such practices.\n\nReputational damage resulting from a judicial conviction or breach of the rules could damage the Company's overall credibility, and an illicit or reprehensible act, even on a single occasion, could negatively impact all Group employees seeking to deliver a message to public authorities. This would mean that the ability to lawfully influence legislation that is harmful to the Group's business sector would be hampered. It could also result in regulatory developments harming the Company's business (tax increases, marketing restrictions, etc.).\n\nAs a result, these regulations could together result in a significant increase in financial expense or a reduction in the Group's activities.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has drawn up a mapping of specific risks related to corruption and influence peddling, updated in 2022. This tool aims to identify and manage corruption and influence peddling risks inherent to the Group's activities and specific to production and distribution processes, as well as cross-functional risks. The Group is also committed to promoting a 'zero tolerance' policy through a clear discourse by the Group's Management and relayed by the local management in affiliates. Specific rules for employees and stakeholders have been put in place. These are set out in the Group's Code of Business Conduct, also updated in 2022, and which includes a mandatory online course for all employees, in order to better understand the potential risks of corruption and influence peddling and the behaviours to adopt in order to prevent them. Pernod Ricard has also adopted digital tools to support its compliance initiatives: Speak Up, a global reporting system for behaviour that violates the Code of Business Conduct; Gifted!, an application dedicated to the declaration and validation of gifts and invitations; Partner Up, a platform for assessing the risk of corruption and influence peddling of third parties working with the Group.\n\nIn line with the development of legislation on these subjects and the expectations of stakeholders, the Group is also working on Human Rights and environmental issues. Since 2015, Blue Source, a mandatory process for all Pernod Ricard direct procurement, has been rolled out. This aims to ensure the integrity of the Group's partners in these areas and supports them in implementing action plans when necessary. Potential partners assessed as not meeting the standards set are not selected to support the Group in its activities.\n\nFinally, the Group's lobbying policy is governed by the Code of Business Conduct, which contains very specific provisions to prevent any reprehensible practices, whether unintended or otherwise. In France, Pernod Ricard files a disclosure statement with the HATVP (2) , the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life, and is a member of Transparency International's Forum des entreprises engag\u00e9es (3) . The Group is also a joint signatory of a best practice guide on parliamentary lobbying expenditure published by Transparency International.\n\n- Note that this risk is also covered in Section 3.4 of the Non-Financial Information Statement.

Risks related to taxes and levies (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nAs an international player in the Wine & Spirits sector, the Group is very sensitive to changes in indirect taxation, in particular customs duties and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, such as the temporary retaliatory duties introduced by the US government in 2019 on imports of single malt Scotch whisky and Spanish wines, followed by duties on certain categories of Cognac in 2021 (transatlantic dispute known as Airbus/Boeing, where the US measures consisted of commercial retaliation to European subsidies for the aerospace industry).\n\nThe Group is also exposed to possible changes in tax regulations, in particular concerning direct taxation, in the countries in which it operates, notably at the instigation of the OECD, the European Union or national governments (including tax rates), and accounting policies and standards.\n\nLastly, Pernod Ricard may be subject to tax audits in several countries, and there is no guarantee that the tax authorities will validate the positions taken by the Group, even if the Group deems them to be correct and reasonable in view of its\n\noperations.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has a tax policy based on compliance with applicable laws and regulations, sound conduct and proactive and efficient tax management. It involves the rejection of all artificial arrangements, the application of a transfer pricing policy based on the arm's length\n\nprinciple, efficient organisation of the tax function within the Group and a transparent attitude towards the tax authorities. Very often, when the Group is confronted with increases in customs duties that affect the entire wine & spirits industry in a given country, the authorities of the exporting country provide their diplomatic support to resolve the problem. As a result, European governments opened a dialogue with the US government to eliminate customs duties arising from the Airbus/Boeing dispute. This action led to the temporary truce in the dispute and the suspension of retaliatory tariffs concerned in the spring of 2021 lasting until June 2025.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's diversification in terms of geographies and product categories mitigates the potential impact of tax risks.\n\nAn increase in import duties and excise taxes or a change in laws relative to duty free sales could result in an increase in the price of the Group's products and a reduction in the consumption of its Wine & Spirits brands or an increase in the Group's costs, thereby affecting the Group's financial position and operating profit. Nevertheless, this risk is qualified by the size of advertising and promotional investment which can, in certain cases, limit the\n\nimpact on consumption of an increase in prices. Other changes in tax regulations could also have a material impact on the Group's results, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate in the countries in which the Group operates. Lastly, in the event that the tax authorities successfully challenge the Group on any material positions, the Group may be subject to additional tax liabilities that may have an adverse effect on the Group's financial position if they are not covered by provisions or if they otherwise trigger a cash payment.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Anti-alcohol environment and regulations (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's businesses throughout the world are subject to a growing number of regulations. Regulatory decisions and changes in legal and regulatory systems could have adverse impacts on Pernod Ricard's business, particularly in the areas of advertising and promotions, labelling and access to distribution. In almost all countries in the world, the production, import/export and sale and distribution of alcohol are subject to special regulations. These are constantly changing. Likewise, the presentation or labelling, advertising and promotion of alcoholic products are subject to increasingly strict regulations, the aim of which is often to better inform consumers about the risks of inappropriate alcohol use and sometimes even reduce their\n\nalcohol consumption.\n\nThe religious, cultural and media context of each country leads to wide variation in the regulation of alcoholic beverages. Senior Management observes a move towards increased constraints on this type of product, its promotion or its distribution, at speeds which nevertheless vary significantly from one country to another.\n\nRegulatory decisions and changes in legal and regulatory requirements in these areas could have a negative impact on Pernod Ricard's business:\n\n- advertising and promotions : regulatory authorities in the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> countries in which the Group trades could impose restrictions on advertising for alcoholic beverages ( e.g. television advertising or sponsorship of sports events). One effect of these limitations would be to prevent or restrict the Group's ability to retain or recruit consumers for its brands in a challenging competitive environment. Restrictions on advertising freedom could also constrain the Group's ability to launch new innovations. They thus have a significant impact on the Group's business;\n- labelling : changes to labelling requirements for alcoholic glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> beverages could diminish the appeal of these products for consumers, who might switch to other less tightly regulated products, resulting in a decline in sales. Furthermore, such changes could have the consequence of increasing costs, thereby affecting the Group's results; and\n- access to distribution : government authorities in countries in glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> which the Group operates may seek to restrict consumer access to the Group's products. For example, the prohibition of alcohol in Bihar (India) led to the cessation of Pernod Ricard's activities in that State. Likewise, restrictions on channels, hours or points of sale are occurring regularly in many countries. These restrictions tend to shift consumption to illegal or parallel distribution channels, which compete with the Group's lawful business.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard actively participates in public debates relating to the adoption of laws and regulations that affect the Group. The Company's teams promote the Group's positions and solutions to local decision-makers and legislators. Pernod Ricard does this through professional bodies to which it belongs, or directly when the subject specifically concerns the Group.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to ensuring that the products distributed are promoted responsibly and in line with the ethical marketing or commercial standards agreed within the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD). Internal controls are in place to ensure compliance with the Pernod Ricard Commercial Communication Code, which includes all the rules to which marketing communications are subject.\n\nIn line with its CSR ambitions, Pernod Ricard also wants to be part of the players who are proactively changing legislation and practices, by promoting alternatives to exclusively repressive solutions to treat alcohol abuse and which have not proven their effectiveness. Currently, more than 150 initiatives to prevent the dangers of abusive or inappropriate consumption are developed by the Group worldwide, alone or with partners. From 2021, a pictogram 'prohibited for minors' as well as a pictogram on the risk of drink-driving have been affixed to all bottles produced by the Group's brands, three years ahead of the initial schedule (insofar as the regulations in the country where they are sold allow it), as well as a digital label warning consumers in detail of the risks related to alcohol abuse.\n\nThe WHO action plan (2022-2030) to reduce the harmful use of alcohol also recognises a role for self-regulation in marketing (where Pernod Ricard has particularly virtuous practices) as well as voluntary consumer information practices, such as the initiatives taken by the Group. This action plan thus rejects any binding global framework agreements and reaffirms the value of public/private dialogue, thus showing a very marked difference from the tobacco sector.\n\n4.",

        "page_content": "Risk factors\n\n## 3. Counterfeiting/IP Rights\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's brands are one of the key aspects of its competitiveness. However, they face various threats: unauthorised reproduction, imitation, use of signs likely to create confusion in the mind of the public, refilling of bottles with counterfeit liquids. These issues remain crucial in various markets, and could pose serious threats to consumers, including endangering their health. In addition, the increasing sophistication of techniques for unauthorised reproduction of the Group's products can lead to difficulties in authenticating them. The Covid-19 pandemic has benefited illicit trade players. The latter made significant profits in the face of a legitimate market weakened by lockdown measures, the closure of on-trade premises, and sometimes even national measures prohibiting the production, import, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages. Today, despite the recovery in activity, companies in the sector remain vulnerable due to profound disruptions in their supply chain (shortage of raw materials, extended delivery times for goods, stock-out situations), creating further openings for the black market. Lastly, the pandemic greatly accelerated the growth of e-commerce, both legal and illegal, due to the postponement of demand during lockdowns; it also sped up the globalisation of counterfeiting activities, enabling a sharp increase in the illicit online B2B trade and thus giving counterfeiters access to quality fraudulent items (finished products, fake caps, fake labels, etc.) wherever they were.\n\nFraudulent use of the Group's brands damages its image and reputation and impacts its development prospects and results, and could cause consumers to shun the Group's products if their reliability is not guaranteed (in the case of refills) or if third parties deliberately create confusion with the Group's brands (brand imitation). It also increased operating costs.\n\nWhile avenues for legal recourse are generally satisfactory, it may be difficult in some countries to obtain swift and dissuasive sanctions against counterfeiters.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe protection and defence of the Group's intellectual property rights is based on a specific organisation established to maximise desired efficiency while minimising costs.\n\nFirst component: at the end of 2014, the Group set up a centralised team (the 'Group Intellectual Property Hub') dedicated notably to protecting the brands. This team ensures the protection of rights and defends them against any attempt by third parties to file similar rights in order to avoid confusion among consumers and the undermining or dilution of the Group's brands. From 1 July 2022, this team will also manage intellectual property disputes (and in particular legal actions launched against counterfeits and/or imitations that may be present on the markets) instead of the Brand Companies that were previously responsible for them. This change should further strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against unauthorised use of the Group's rights and make it possible to optimise protection strategies.\n\nSecond component: a Global Trade Intelligence team leads the fight against illicit trade in the Group's products globally by coordinating all action taken against counterfeiting and other forms of trafficking. This action takes the form of investigations on the ground or online, and legal action combined with initiatives to raise awareness among local authorities. The Global Trade Intelligence team also supports the marketing and operations teams at the Group's Head Office and affiliates in the development of technical/technological measures to improve the protection and authentication of our products. Examples of such measures include a scheme based on the principle of the smart bottle, introduced in strategic markets such as China, which enables consumers to check the authenticity of the Group's products using a QR code integrated into the packaging.\n\nThe defence of intellectual property rights also involves operational staff, who are called on to identify imitations (products/brands) in the field and to pass on all necessary information to the aforementioned teams for action.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Major litigation\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nLike other companies in the Wine & Spirits sector, the Group may be the subject of legal action or other litigation and complaints from consumers or government authorities. In addition, the Group routinely faces litigation in the normal course of business. The Group records provisions for all disputes in which it is involved and all risks it faces. At 30 June 2022, these provisions totalled \u20ac441 million, compared with \u20ac366 million at 30 June 2021 (see Note 4.7 Provisions to the consolidated financial statements ).\n\nMajor litigation of any type could have an adverse impact on the Group's financial position (in the event of a fine or damages), or the Group's image and reputation due to media coverage and posts on social networks, and may result in the loss of rights, in particular intellectual property rights (such as in the event of the cancellation of a trademark).\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo avoid litigation, the Legal Department, in charge of the Group's protection and defence, has implemented preventive measures. Marketing and operational teams are made aware of legal issues on an ongoing basis, model agreements are made available, and the legal teams provide support in the very early stages of projects. Legal functions have been established at the regional and local levels to ensure better local monitoring. Furthermore, a quarterly report listing the major risks identified by local legal teams, particularly with regard to compliance, counterfeiting, cyberattack, personal data and potential major disputes is sent to staff at head office, who are responsible for coordination.\n\n## Financial risks IV.\n\nThe Group's main financial risks are market, credit and liquidity risks. They are subject to risk management policies and procedures put in place to measure and manage them and reduce their occurrence or impact.\n\nIn an economic context that remains uncertain and in order to manage the liquidity risk that may result from the repayment of financial liabilities at their contractual maturity, Pernod Ricard has taken precautionary measures to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet its needs and continues to diversify its sources of financing, thereby limiting dependence on various lenders.\n\nThus, the Group anticipated the refinancing of a portion of its bonds in October 2021 (issuance and early redemption of existing bonds in euros via the exercise of the make-whole option provided for in the contract, for an equivalent amount).\n\n## 1. Foreign exchange risk (2)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue to its international footprint, the Group is naturally exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies (excluding the euro, its functional and reporting currency) in which its operations are carried out (transaction and translation risks) and in which its assets and liabilities are denominated.\n\nFluctuations of this nature may therefore have an impact on Pernod Ricard's results and shareholder equity. They include:\n\n- conversion risk for the financial statements of consolidated glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> affiliates with a functional currency other than the euro; and\n- operational risks on operating cash flows not denominated glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> in the entities' functional currency.\n\nMoreover, fluctuations in currencies against the euro (notably the US dollar) may impact the nominal amount of these debts and the financial expense reported in euros in the consolidated financial statements, and this could affect the Group's reported results.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency of the distributing entity. The resulting net foreign exchange exposures are hedged by the use of forward transactions. Residual risk may be partially hedged by the use of financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) intended to hedge highly probable receivables or payables or to secure the receipt of dividends. For asset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural\n\nhedging.\n\nThe Group also issued in April 2022 a bond of \u20ac750M with a maturity of 7 years (1) . The transactions made it possible to substantially extend the average maturity of the Group's bond debt.\n\nAs of 30 June 2022, the Group's cash position stood at \u20ac2.5 billion, plus around \u20ac3.3 billion in undrawn secured credit lines, including a \u20ac500 million revolving credit line set up in March 2022.\n\nThe Credit Agreements also set out obligations, including a commitment to provide lenders with adequate information, compliance with a solvency ratio at each half-year end (which must be less than or equal to 5.25) and compliance with certain commitments customary in this type of credit agreement (including the maintenance of the credit's pari passu ranking).\n\n4.",

Credit risk (2)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe diversity and multiplicity of the Group's distribution network, spread over many countries, and the diversification of the main customers from the large retail sector, limit its exposure.\n\nMoreover, internal procedures are in place to assess the financial health of the Group's customers and adapt credit terms and activity as appropriate.\n\nLastly, risk of this nature is limited by the subscription of credit insurance with the standard guarantees. The Group's risk hedging policy is based on the partial transfer of risk to insurers.\n\n## 4. Pensions (3)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's unfunded pension obligations amounted to \u20ac361 million as of 30 June 2022. During FY22, the Group's\n\nThe Group's pension obligations are for the most part covered by balance sheet provisions and partially covered by pension funds or insurance. The amount of these provisions is based on certain actuarial assumptions, including, for example, discounting factors, demographic trends, pension trends, future salary trends\n\ncontributions to pension plans totalled \u20ac64 million. and expected returns on plan assets.\n\nThe asset/liability balance is subject to, among other factors, the performance of invested assets. A liquidity crisis or major financial shock could significantly undermine the performance of financial assets and jeopardise the asset/liability balance. A pronounced asset/liability imbalance may require an increase in the Group's pension liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and result in an increase in the allowance for retirement provisions. This could have a significant negative impact on the Group's financial income/(expense).\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nSpecific governance and a management policy have been implemented and are regularly reviewed in line with the risk profile of the Group's various pension plans. The investment strategy is subject to frequent review in order to minimise the volatility of assets. The buy-in transaction achieved for the largest of the Group's Pension Fund in September 2019 is a concrete example of the active derisking strategy. The Fund's Trustee has purchased an insurance policy from a highly rated and well established insurance company to cover the majority of the pensions obligations. The insurance policy therefore reduces the Group's exposure on that Fund to funding deficits arising from market risks, including inflation and interest rate risks, and longevity risks. In addition, defined-benefit plans (mainly affiliates in North America, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe) are subject to an\n\nannual actuarial valuation on the basis of country-specific assumptions.\n\n- Note 4.9 to the consolidated financial statements (1)\n- Note 4.9 to the consolidated financial statements.

This transfer is accompanied by a policy of prevention to reduce risk as much as possible. The Group evaluates its risks with care in order to fine-tune the level of coverage of the risks it incurs.\n\nThe Group has two types of coverage: Group insurance programmes and local policies. The programmes at Group level are monitored by the Audit Director who coordinates the insurance and risk management policy, and also by a person in charge of monitoring industrial risk prevention.\n\n## Insurance policies 4.3.1\n\nIn order to cover the main risks, Pernod Ricard has set up international insurance programmes for all Group affiliates, barring exceptions due to local regulatory constraints in certain countries or as a result of more attractive conditions offered by the local market. These programmes provide the following coverage:\n\n- property damage and business interruption losses; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- operating/product liability, including costs and losses glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> incurred by the Group due to accidental and/or criminal contamination;\n\n## Coverage 4.3.2\n\n## Type of insurance\n\n## Coverage and limits on the main insurance policies (1)\n\n| Property damage                                           | Coverage: fully comprehensive (except exclusions). glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Basis of compensation: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| and business interruption losses                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| General civil liability (operating and product liability) | interruption losses.

All these players have the experience and means required for managing exceptional situations.\n\n## Risks and disputes: provisioning procedure 4.4\n\nAs part of its commercial activities, the Pernod Ricard Group is involved in legal actions and subject to tax, customs and administrative audits. The Group only records provisions for risks and contingencies when it is likely that a current obligation stemming from a past event will require the payment of an amount that can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to extinguish this liability. Provisions accordingly involve an assessment by Group Management.\n\n## Financial and accounting information 4.5\n\n## Preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements 4.5.1\n\nIn addition to the management information described above, the Group prepares half-year and annual consolidated financial statements. This process is managed by the Consolidation Department attached to the Group's Finance Department, as follows:\n\n- communication of the main Group accounting and financial glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> policies through a procedures manual;\n- preparation of specific instructions by the Consolidation glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Department, including a detailed timetable, and issuance to the affiliates prior to each consolidation;\n- consolidation by sub-group; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- preparation of the consolidated financial statements on the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> basis of the information provided, to cover the entire scope of consolidation; and\n- use of a single software package by Group affiliates. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> The maintenance of this software package and user training are carried out by the Group's Finance Department, with occasional assistance from external consultants.\n\nIn addition, consolidated affiliates sign a letter of representation addressed to the Statutory Auditors, which is also sent to the Headquarters. This letter is binding on the Senior Management of each consolidated affiliate with regard to the accuracy and completeness of the financial information sent to the Headquarters in respect of the consolidation process.\n\n## Preparation of Pernod Ricard's separate financial statements 4.5.2\n\nPernod Ricard prepares its separate financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. It prepares the consolidation package in accordance with the instructions received from the Company's Finance Department.\n\nParis, 20\u00a0September 2022\n\nMr\u00a0Alexandre Ricard\n\nChairman and CEO",

glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> of around 16%, with an optimised return on investment;\n- the continuation of our investments in structure costs, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> in particular to support the rollout of the Conviviality Platform;\n- an increase in CAPEX, with a ratio of approximately 7% of net glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> sales, and an increase in strategic inventories to support future growth;\n- a share buyback programme for FY23 of between glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> \u20ac500 million and \u20ac750 million will be carried out, in line with the priorities defined

        "page_content": "## Definitions and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures 5.5 to IFRS measures\n\nPernod Ricard's management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group's performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.\n\n## Organic growth 5.5.1\n\nOrganic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements, acquisitions and disposals and changes in applicable accounting principles.\n\nExchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year's exchange rates.\n\nFor acquisitions in the current year, the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year.\n\nWhere a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year, the Group excludes in the organic movement calculations the results for that business from the prior year. For disposals or terminations in the current year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.\n\nThis measure enables the Group to focus on the performance of the business which is common to both years and which represents those measures that Local Managers are most directly able to influence.\n\n## Free Cash Flow 5.5.2\n\nFree Cash Flow comprises the net cash flow from operating activities, aggregated with the proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and after deduction of the capital expenditures.\n\n## 'Recurring' indicators 5.5.3\n\nThe following three measures represent key indicators for the measurement of the recurring performance of the business, excluding significant items that, because of their nature and their unusual occurrence, cannot be considered as inherent to the recurring performance of the Group:\n\n## Recurring Free Cash Flow glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nRecurring Free Cash Flow is calculated by restating Free Cash Flow from non-recurring items.\n\n## Profit from recurring operations glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nProfit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-current operating income and expenses.\n\n## Group share of net profit from recurring operations glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nGroup net profit from recurring operations corresponds to net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent before other non-recurring operating income and expenses, non-recurring financial income and expenses and non-recurring income taxes.\n\n## Net debt 5.5.4\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross financial debt (translated at the closing rate), including lease liabilities and derivatives designated as fair value hedges and net foreign currency asset hedges (hedging of net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## EBITDA 5.5.5\n\nEBITDA stands for 'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation'.

        "page_content": "## Material contracts 5.6\n\n## Significant contracts not related 5.6.1 to financing\n\n## Suntory 5.6.1.1\n\nIn 1988, Allied Domecq entered into a series of agreements with Suntory Ltd, one of Japan's leading producers and distributors of spirits. One of the provisions of these agreements concerned the creation of a joint-venture company in Japan called Suntory Allied Ltd, in which 49.99% of the capital and voting rights are owned by Allied Domecq and 50.01% by Suntory Ltd. Suntory Allied Ltd was granted the exclusive distribution rights for certain Allied Domecq brands in Japan until 31 March 2029.\n\nThe management of Suntory Allied Ltd is jointly controlled by Pernod Ricard, as successor-in-interest to Allied Domecq, and Suntory Ltd.\n\n## Sale and repurchase agreements 5.6.1.2\n\nPernod Ricard did not conclude any sale and repurchase agreements during FY22.\n\n## Financing contracts 5.6.2\n\n## Credit Agreements 5.6.2.1\n\n## 2017 Credit Agreement (syndicated credit)\n\nAs part of the refinancing of the bank debt taken out in 2012 to cover the Group's short-term financing requirements, Pernod Ricard and certain of its affiliates signed a new five-year \u20ac2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the ' Credit Agreement ') on 14 June 2017. As the extension options to six or seven years have been activated, this agreement now expires in 2024.\n\nThe obligations of each of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard. No security interest ( s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ) was granted under the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n\n## 2022 Credit Agreement (bilateral credit)\n\nOn 22 March 2022, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard Finance entered into a bilateral revolving credit agreement, the 'Bilateral Credit Agreement', together with the Credit Agreement, the ' credit agreements ', with a principal amount of \u20ac500 million, for an initial period of three years, with the possibility of an extension of one year at the end of the third year and one additional year at the end of the fourth year.\n\nThe obligations of Pernod Ricard Finance under the Bilateral Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard. No security interest ( s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ) was granted under the terms of the Bilateral Credit Agreement.\n\n## Provisions of the Credit Agreements\n\nThe Credit Agreements cLontain customary representations and warranties, as well as the usual restrictive covenants contained in such contracts, notably restricting the ability of some Group companies (subject to certain exceptions) to pledge their assets as security interest, alter the general nature of the Group's activities or carry out certain acquisition transactions.\n\nThe Credit Agreements also set out obligations, including a commitment to provide lenders with adequate information, compliance with a solvency ratio at each half-year end as mentioned hereunder (the ' Solvency Ratio '), and compliance with certain commitments customary in this type of credit agreement (including the maintenance of the credit's pari passu ranking).\n\n## Solvency ratio (total consolidated Net 5.6.2.2 debt/consolidated EBITDA)\n\nThe Solvency Ratio must be 5.25 or less. At 30 June 2022, the Group was compliant with this solvency ratio (see 'Liquidity risks' in this management report).\n\nThe Credit Agreements incorporate the main terms of the 2012 syndicated Credit Agreement and, in addition, provide for certain cases of voluntary or compulsory early repayment obligations, depending on circumstances, which are standard practice for credit agreements of this kind (including non-compliance with commitments, change of control and cross default). The Credit Agreements also contain a clause under which the taking of control of Pernod Ricard by any other person or group of persons acting in concert (other than Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard or any group of persons acting in concert with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard) is likely to constitute grounds for compulsory early repayment.\n\n## Bond issuance 5.6.2.3\n\nThe Group has issued Bonds (the 'Bonds') through (i) Pernod Ricard, and (ii) Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC, a wholly-owned affiliate of Pernod Ricard, whose issues are secured by Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe nominal amount of the Bonds and the interest thereon constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the issuer in question, ranking equally amongst themselves and pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt, present and future, of said issuer. In addition, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC have undertaken not to grant any security interests in respect of Bonds or other debt securities admitted, or liable to be admitted, to trading on a regulated market, an over-the-counter market or other stock exchange unless the Bonds benefit from similar collateral or other collateral approved, as the case may be, by the mass of bondholders (Pernod Ricard) or by the meeting of bondholders (Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC).\n\nThese bond issuances include a clause regarding change of control, which could lead to the compulsory early repayment of Bonds upon request of each bondholder in the event of a change of control of Pernod Ricard (benefitting a person or a group of persons acting in concert) and leading to a deterioration in Pernod Ricard's financial rating.\n\nIn addition, these Bonds may be redeemed early if certain customary events of default arise.\n\n5.",

According to the terms of the Programme, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC may issue Bonds by means of private placements in various currencies. The issues of Pernod Ricard International Finance LLC under the programme will be secured by Pernod Ricard SA. The securities may be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. The maximum nominal amount of securities outstanding under the Programme is set at \u20ac7 billion (or its equivalent in any other currency). At its meeting on 21 July 2021, the Board of Directors authorised Pernod Ricard to issue Bonds under the Programme up to a maximum nominal amount of \u20ac1.5 billion (or its equivalent in any other currency) for a period of one year from 21 July 2021.\n\n## Sustainability-Linked Bond 5.6.2.5.\n\nOn 7 April 2022, Pernod Ricard successfully completed its inaugural sustainability-linked bond issuance for an aggregate amount of \u20ac750 million for seven years. This transaction illustrates Pernod Ricard's ongoing integration of sustainability actions into its daily operations and financing strategy, in line with the Group's Sustainability & Responsibility (S&R) Roadmap. This first sustainability-linked bond illustrates the Group's ambition to become an active player in sustainable finance.\n\nPernod Ricard has chosen two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are relevant, core and material to its overall business and of high strategic significance to the Group's current and/or future operations. The KPIs are aligned with the S&R roadmap and the United Nations 2030 SDGs as part of the 2030 Agenda. For these two KPIs, Pernod Ricard has set ambitious Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) to highlight its commitment and leadership across the sector, with both shortand long-term trajectories.",

This result reflects the numerous investments made in terms of energy efficiency (such as the replacement of boilers with high energy efficiency units and the recycling of steam using mechanical vapour recompression technology), the increased use of biofuels and biomass in distilleries, the installation of on-site solar panels as well as the purchase of renewable electricity through PPAs and green certificates over the last four years.\n\nThe reduction in the intensity of water consumption by distilleries is on track, with the FY25 target almost achieved in FY22. The Group consolidated the water consumption reduction roadmaps of the main contributing affiliates, and identified associated investment plans to achieve the 2030 targets.\n\nThese KPIs were audited by an external independent third party, with moderate assurance. The audit report is available on the Group's official website.\n\n## Europe Factoring Agreement 5.6.2.6\n\nOn 15 December 2008, certain affiliates of Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard Finance signed a factoring framework agreement with BNP Paribas Factor, to set up a pan-European factoring programme in the gross amount of \u20ac350 million, which was increased to \u20ac400 million by an addendum dated 23 June 2009. The programme was most recently renewed on 3 December 2018, for a period of five years from 1 January 2019. This programme was agreed in the amount of \u20ac500 million. The receivables are sold under the contractual subrogation regime under French law, except where certain local legal restrictions are in force. As substantially all of the risks and rewards related to the receivables are transferred to the purchaser in accordance with this factoring programme, transferred receivables are deconsolidated.\n\n## Securitisation (Master Receivables 5.6.2.7 Assignment Agreement)\n\nOn 24 June 2009, certain affiliates of Pernod Ricard entered into an international securitisation programme arranged by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The purpose of the programme was the transfer of eligible commercial receivables to \u20acSTR, in accordance with the provisions of a framework agreement dated 24 June 2009 and country-specific agreements entered into at the time that each relevant affiliate joined the programme. This programme was renewed on 13 June 2022 under the terms of an addendum to the framework agreement. The programme amounts to \u20ac65 million, US$230 million, \u00a3145 million and 400 million Swedish kronor.\n\nThis two-year programme includes a change of control clause that applies to each affiliate participating in the programme as a seller, which could lead to the early repayment of the programme by the affiliate concerned by such change of control. 'Change of control' is defined as Pernod Ricard ceasing to hold, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the share capital or voting rights of an affiliate participating in the programme as a seller, unless (i) Pernod Ricard continues to hold, directly or indirectly, 50% of the share capital or voting rights of such affiliate and (ii) issues, at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, a guarantee in terms that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB deems satisfactory (acting reasonably) for the purpose of securing the obligations of such affiliate under the securitisation transaction documents.\n\n## Factoring agreement Pacific 5.6.2.8\n\nOn 18 March 2013, a new agreement for the sale of receivables was signed between Pernod Ricard Winemakers Pty Ltd (formerly Premium Wine Brands Pty (1) ), Pernod Ricard Winemakers New Zealand Limited (formerly Pernod Ricard New Zealand Limited) and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. This factoring agreement covers Australia and New Zealand and amounts to AUD128.5 million and NZD45 million. The receivables sale agreement was taken over in full by BNP Paribas on 4 December 2015, replacing The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.\n\nAdditional information on the impact of these financing contracts on the Group's financial statements is provided in Notes 4.8.1 Breakdown of net financial debt by nature and maturity and 4.8.7 Bonds to the consolidated financial statements .",

The Company is headquartered at 5, cours Paul Ricard, 75008 Paris, France and is listed on the Euronext exchange. The annual consolidated financial statements reflect the accounting position of Pernod Ricard and its affiliates (the 'Group'). They are reported in millions of euros (\u20ac), rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThe Group manufactures and sells wines and spirits.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 on 31 August 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies and significant events Note 1\n\n## Accounting policies and principles Note 1.1\n\n## Principles and accounting standards governing 1. the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements\n\nBecause of its listing in a country of the European Union, and in accordance with EC Regulation 1606/02, the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe accounting policies used to prepare the annual consolidated financial statements to 30 June 2022 are consistent with those used for the annual consolidated financial statements to 30 June 2021, with the exception of standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union applicable to the Group from 1 July 2021 (see Note 1.1.2 Changes in accounting standards ). The Group does not adopt early application of standards or interpretations.\n\nThe Group's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards 2.\n\n## Standards, amendments and interpretations whose implementation has been mandatory since 1 July 2021\n\nDuring the first half of the year, the Group finalised the calculation of the impacts related to the decision published by the IFRIC in April 2021 on IAS 19 'Employee benefits' and regarding attribution of employee benefits to periods of service. This decision clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed in allocating the IAS 19 expense.\n\nThis decision impacts few plans, mainly in France, and reduces the amount of the retirement provision in the Group's consolidated financial statements by \u20ac11 million (before deferred tax of \u20ac3 million). It has no material effect on the cost of services recognised on an annual basis. As the impact of this decision is relatively insignificant, the Group has not restated its financial statements for past periods and has recognised this amount directly in the Group's consolidated reserves. The impact of this decision on Group shareholder equity is identified separately in 6.4 Statement of changes in consolidated shareholder equity for the period .\n\nThe Group applies the changes made by the IFRIC decision of April 2021 relating to the customisation and configuration costs of SaaS (Software as a Service) software from 1 July 2021.\n\nThe latter clarifies:\n\n- the rules for recognising this type of expense as intangible assets glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> or expenses, considering in particular that, in the event that the Company does not have control of the underlying assets, these costs do not meet the definition of non-current assets;\n- the rules for recognising these expenses, limiting the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> possibility of spreading them over several financial years to the sole case of customisation services provided by the supplier of the SaaS software and not distinct from the services of supplying the software.\n\nThe implementation of this decision has no material impact on the Group's financial statements. As such, the Group has not applied this decision to the comparative financial statements. The costs of configuring and customising SaaS software that had previously been capitalised were restated at 1 July 2021 as a counterparty to shareholder equity for \u20ac25 million after tax, with the exception of costs eligible for spreading over several financial years, in accordance with the provisions of the IFRIC decision (see Note 6.4 Statement of changes in consolidated shareholder equity for the period ).\n\nAs of 1 July 2021, the Group has applied the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 as part of the phase 2 benchmark interest rate reform, which were published by the IASB in August 2020 and adopted by the European Union. The Group has finalised negotiations with the counterparties to make the transition to the new indices for the currencies concerned (GBP, CHF, JPY and EUR). At closing, the Group's exposure to financial instruments indexed to floating rates with a maturity date beyond implementation of the reform is limited.\n\nNo other new standards, amendments or interpretations are applicable to Pernod Ricard as of 1 July 2021.\n\n## Measurement basis 3.\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost method, except for certain categories of assets and liabilities, which are measured in accordance with the methods provided by IFRS.\n\n## Principal uncertainties arising from the use of 4. estimates and judgements by Management\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS means that Group Management makes a certain number of estimates and assumptions which have an impact on the amount of the Group's assets and liabilities, and items of profit and loss during the financial year. These estimates are made on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, and are based on information available at the time of their preparation. Estimates may be revised where the circumstances on which they were based change or where new information becomes available. Future outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAs indicated in Note 4.1 Intangible assets and goodwill , in addition to annual impairment tests applied to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (such as brands), the Group carries out spot impairment tests where there is an indication that the value of an intangible asset may have been impaired. Any impairment loss is calculated using discounted future cash flows and/or the market values of the assets in question. These calculations require the use of assumptions regarding market conditions and projected cash flows, and any changes in these assumptions may thus lead to results different from those initially estimated.\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nAs indicated in Note 4.7 Provisions , the Group runs defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. In addition, provisions are also recognised in virtue of certain other post-employment benefits such as life insurance and medical care (mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom). The carrying amount of these provisions at the reporting date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\nThese benefit obligations are based on a number of assumptions such as discount rates, future salary increases, the rate of employee turnover and life expectancy.\n\n6.",

        "page_content": "These assumptions are generally updated annually. The assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022 and the procedures used in their determination are set out in Note 4.7 Provisions . The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified. However, such actuarial assumptions may change in the future and this may have a material impact on the amount of the Group's benefit obligations and on its profits.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nAs indicated in Note 3.3 Corporate income tax , the deferred tax assets recognised result mainly from tax loss carryforwards and from temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised if it is probable that the Group will have future taxable profits against which such losses will be used. The assessment of whether the Group will be able to use these tax losses is largely a matter of judgement. Analyses are carried out to decide whether or not these tax loss carryforwards are likely to be usable in the future.\n\n## Provisions\n\nAs explained in Note 4.7 Provisions , the Group is involved in a number of disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. In some cases, the amounts requested by the claimants are significant and the legal proceedings can take several years. In this context, provisions are calculated on the basis of the Group's best estimate of the amount that will be payable based on the information available (notably that provided by the Group's legal advisers). Any change to assumptions can have a significant effect on the amount of the provision recognised. The carrying amount of these provisions at the reporting date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\n## Judgements\n\nIn the absence of standards or interpretations applicable to a specific transaction, Group Management uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that provide relevant and reliable information in the context of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nAccording to the provisions of IAS 29, Argentina and Turkey are considered to be hyperinflationary economies.\n\nHowever, given the contribution of the business performance of Argentina and Turkey to the Group's financial statements, the impact of the application of IAS 29 has been deemed non-material, and the corresponding restatements have not been made.\n\n## Business combinations 5.\n\nBusiness combinations carried out before 1 July 2009 were recognised using the accounting standards in force as of 30 June 2009. Business combinations after 1 July 2009 are measured and recognised in accordance with the revised version of IFRS 3: the consideration transferred (cost of acquisition) is measured at the fair value of assets given, shareholder equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the transaction date. Identifiable assets and liabilities belonging to the acquired company are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition, such as legal, due diligence and other professional fees are recognised as other operating expenses incurred.\n\nAny surplus consideration in excess of the Group's share in the fair value of the acquired company's identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. The option is available for each transaction to apply either proportionate or full goodwill methods. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign entities is denominated in the functional currency of the business acquired. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test once a year or more often if there is any indication that its value may have been impaired.\n\nFinally, in accordance with IFRS 3 as revised and IAS 27 as amended, the Group recognised in shareholder equity the difference between the price paid and the proportional part of non-controlling interests acquired in previously controlled companies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation 6.\n\n## Reporting currency used in the consolidated 6.1 financial statements\n\nThe Group's annual consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros, which is the functional currency and the reporting currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## Functional currency 6.2\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the economic environment in which it mainly operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the entity's local currency. However, in a very limited number of entities, a functional currency that is different from the local currency may be used if it reflects the entity's economic environment and the currency in which most of the entity's transactions are denominated.\n\n## Translation of transactions denominated 6.3 in foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are generally translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at the historical exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applying at the closing date. Foreign currency differences are recognised in profit and loss for the period, except for foreign currency differences arising on debts designated as hedges for the net foreign currency assets of consolidated affiliates. The latter are recognised directly in shareholder equity, under translation differences, until the disposal of the net investment. Foreign currency differences related to operating activities are recognised within operating profit for the period; foreign currency differences related to financing activities are recognised within financial income (expense) or in shareholder equity.\n\n## Translation of financial statements 6.4 of affiliates whose functional currency is different from the euro (the reporting currency)\n\nThe balance sheet is translated into euros at year-end exchange rates. The income statement and cash flows are translated on the basis of average exchange rates. The differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of these affiliates are recognised in translation differences within shareholder equity under other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, translation differences previously recognised in shareholder equity are recognised in profit and loss.",

        "page_content": "## Assets held for sale and discontinued 7. operations\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations), where they are significant, assets and liabilities held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation or amortisation. They are shown separately in the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. An asset is considered as being held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. In order for this to be the case, the asset must be available for immediate sale and its sale must be highly probable. Items in the balance sheet related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented under specific lines in the annual consolidated financial statements. Income statement items related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented separately in the financial statements for all periods reported upon if they are significant from a Group perspective.\n\n## Consideration of climate risks 8.\n\nClimate scenarios are currently being analysed, and will set out the climate change challenges for the Pernod Ricard Group. Considering the information studied to date, the Group believes that climate change has no short-term impact on the assumptions used to prepare the financial statements, given the nature of its activities and its geographical location. The consideration of the effects of climate change is notably reflected in Pernod Ricard's 'Good times from a Good Place' strategy through its commitments in terms of 'Net zero Carbon', the supply of sustainable agricultural raw materials, the footprint on its terroirs and the circularity of its packaging and promotional items.\n\nIn addition:\n\n- Pernod Ricard has taken into account the future effects glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> deemed most likely in the medium and long term relating to these climate challenges, more responsible consumption and costs aimed at implementing the 'Good times from a Good Place' strategy in its business plans for the preparation of its impairment tests. The Group's exposure to climate impacts could result in changes in the price of raw materials, energy and transport;\n- the implementation of this strategy does not call into glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> question the useful life of its tangible assets. Nevertheless, in order to comply with its roadmap, the Pernod Ricard Group invests in additional assets aimed at reducing the climate impact of its activities;\n- Pernod Ricard's climate commitments in terms of reducing glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> greenhouse gases and its water consumption are also reflected in its financing strategy, through the issuance in 2022 of a 'sustainability-linked' bond for \u20ac750 million, the interest rates of which will depend on the achievement of ambitious objectives as part of its sustainable development strategy.\n\n## Significant events during Note 1.2 the financial year\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals 1.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Group pursued its strategy by strengthening its positions, in particular through partnerships/acquisitions of super and ultra-premium brands in booming categories such as the acquisition of minority stakes in the Company Sovereign Brands, owner in particular of the Bumbu Rum brand and of the French sparkling wine brand Luc Belaire. The Group also strengthened its positions in e-commerce through the 100% acquisition of The Whisky\n\nExchange, as well as its luxury offering through the acquisition of a majority stake in Ch\u00e2teau Sainte Marguerite, a C\u00f4tes-de-Provence Cru Class\u00e9 since 1955.\n\nAcquisitions and partnerships concluded during the financial year represented a total amount of around \u20ac550 million, included in 'Purchases of financial assets and activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nAs part of its dynamic brand portfolio management strategy, the Group also sold the Armagnac Montesquiou brand in France. It also entered into an agreement to sell the Tormore Scotch Whisky brand and its distillery.\n\n## Bond issues and redemption 2.\n\nOn 4 October 2021, the Pernod Ricard Group, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, issued a bond issue of \u20ac500 million over an eight-year tranche, bearing interest at the fixed annual rate of 0.125%.\n\nOn 21 October 2021, Pernod Ricard SA redeemed the full \u20ac500 million bond bearing a coupon of 1.875% maturing in September 2023 in accordance with the optional redemption clause set out in the terms and conditions of this bond. This early redemption gave rise to the payment of an exceptional balance (known as make-whole call) of \u20ac24 million.\n\nOn 7 April 2022, Pernod Ricard carried out a Sustainability-linked bond issue denominated in euros, with a maturity of seven years, for an amount of \u20ac750 million and bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.375%. Two environmental commitments have been indexed to this obligation: the reduction in the absolute amount of the Group's greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) and the reduction in its water consumption per unit of alcohol produced in the distilleries. The financial conditions of this bond will be impacted by an adjustment of the coupon rate of 0.25% per objective in the event the failure to achieve the target for either one of the two criteria selected on the date the targets are measured, i.e. at the end of the 2025 financial year. This adjustment will apply from the first day of the interest period following the first measurement date and until the maturity of the bond.\n\n## Employee share ownership plan 3.\n\nDuring FY22, the Group set up an employee share ownership plan for the second time in its history. Details of this plan, as well as its impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements, are provided in Note 6.2 Employee Share Ownership Plan , to the annual consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impact of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict 4.\n\nIn February 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated dramatically into a situation of war.\n\nIn this context, the health and safety of Pernod Ricard employees remain the Group's primary concern, leading to the provision of assistance to local teams and their families. Pernod Ricard made a donation of \u20ac1 million to support the work of the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and, to meet the requests of many employees who wished to contribute to this, pledged to double the amount of their individual donations.\n\nThe Group generated approximately 3% of its net sales in Russia and Ukraine before the conflict. It does not hold any significant assets in the region. Analysis of these assets, in these exceptional circumstances, led the Group to recognise impairments of receivables. No other impairments were identified. A cautious approach was used in performing brand impairment tests and goodwill, consisting mainly of excluding future cash flows from the region, given the high level of uncertainty.\n\n6.",

They are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received, after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, certain costs associated with business and promotional activity and sales-related taxes and duties, notably excise duties.\n\n## Costs of commercial and promotional activity\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15, certain costs of services rendered in connection with sales, such as advertising programmes in conjunction with distributors, listing costs for new products, promotional activities at point of sale, and advertising and promotional expenses, are deducted directly from net sales if there is no distinct service whose fair value can be reliably measured.\n\n## Duties and taxes\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, certain import duties, in Asia for instance, are classified as cost of sales, as these duties are not specifically re-billed to customers (as is the case for social security stamps in France, for example).\n\n## Discounts\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, early payment discounts are not considered to be financial transactions, but rather are deducted directly from net sales.\n\n## Gross margin after logistics expenses, contribution after advertising and promotion expenses, profit from recurring operations and other operating income and expenses\n\nThe gross margin after logistics expenses corresponds to net sales (excluding duties and taxes), less costs of sales and logistics expenses. The contribution after advertising and promotion expenses includes the gross margin after logistics expenses and advertising and promotion expenses. The Group applies recommendation 2013-R03 of the French accounting standards authority (Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables - ANC), notably as regards the definition of Profit from recurring operations. Profit from recurring operations is the contribution after advertising and promotion expenses less trading costs and overheads. This is the indicator used internally to measure the Group's operational performance. It excludes other operating income and expenses, such as those related to restructuring, capital gains and losses on disposals, impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and other non-recurring operating income or expenses. These other operating income and expenses are excluded from Profit from recurring operations because the Group believes they have little predictive value due to their occasional nature. They are described in detail in Note 3.1 Other operating income/(expenses) .\n\nThe Group is focused on the single business line of Wines and Spirits sales. The Group is structured into three primary operating segments constituted by the following geographical areas: Europe, Americas and Asia/Rest of the World.\n\nThe Group Management Team assesses the performance of each segment on the basis of net sales and its profit from recurring operations, defined as the gross margin after logistics expenses, advertising, promotional and structure costs. The operating segments presented are identical to those included in the reporting provided to Senior Management, in particular for the performance analysis.\n\nItems in the income statement and the balance sheet are allocated on the basis of either the destination of sales or profits. Operating segments follow the same accounting policies as those used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Intra-segment transfers are transacted at market prices.\n\n| At 30.06.2021 \u20acmillion                                | Americas   | Asia/Rest of the World   | Europe   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Income statement items                                |            |                          |          |         |\n| Segment net sales                                     | 3,794      | 5,494                    | 4,185    | 13,473  |\n| o/w intersegment sales                                | 1,167      | 1,854                    | 1,628    | 4,649   |\n| Net sales (excluding Group)                           | 2,627      | 3,640                    | 2,557    | 8,824   |\n| Gross margin after logistics expenses                 | 1,699      | 2,060                    | 1,534    | 5,293   |\n| Contribution after advertising and promotion expenses | 1,229      | 1,518                    | 1,153    | 3,900   |\n| Profit from recurring operations                      | 803        | 996                      | 624      | 2,423   |\n| Other information                                     |            |                          |          |         |\n| Current investments                                   | 106        | 109                      | 316      | 531     |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment             | 42         | 165                      | 236      | 444     |",

        "page_content": "Deferred tax is recognised on time differences between the tax and book values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and is measured using the balance sheet approach. Deferred taxes relating to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognised on a net basis. The effects of changes in tax rates are recognised in shareholder equity or in profit and loss in the year in which the change of tax rates is decided. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to present value. In order to evaluate the Group's ability to recover these assets, particular account is taken of forecasts of future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are only reported when they are likely to be recovered, based on projections of taxable income calculated by the Group at the end of each financial year. All assumptions used, including, in particular, growth in operating profit and financial income (expenses), taking into account interest rates, are updated by the Group at the reporting date based on data determined by the relevant senior management.\n\nDeferred taxes are broken down by nature as follows:\n\n| \u20acmillion                                                                 | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Margins in inventories                                                   | 111          | 180          |\n| Fair value adjustments on assets and liabilities                         | 13           | 20           |\n| Provisions for pension benefits                                          | 78           | 65           |\n| Deferred tax assets related to losses eligible for carryforwards         | 913          | 1,028        |\n| Provisions (other than provisions for pensions benefits) and other items | 509          | 551          |\n| Total deferred tax assets                                                | 1,623        | 1,844        |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation                                             | 175          | 190          |\n| Fair value adjustments on assets and liabilities                         | 2,469        | 2,734        |\n| Pension and other hedging assets                                         | 181          | 215          |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities                                           | 2,825        | 3,139        |\n\nTax loss carryforwards (recognised and unrecognised) represented potential tax savings of \u20ac1,298 million at 30 June 2022 and \u20ac1,154 million at 30 June 2021.

With the exception of assets with indefinite useful lives, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their period of use, which is generally less than five years, and are written down when their recoverable amount is less than their net carrying amount. Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.\n\nIn the context of the Group's activities, and in accordance with IAS 38 'Intangible assets', research and development costs are recognised as expenses in the financial year during which they are incurred, except for certain development costs which meet the capitalisation criteria described by the standard.\n\n## Movements of the period\n\n| \u20acmillion                | 30.06.2020   | Acquisitions   | Allowances   | Disposals   | Foreign currency gains and losses   | Other movements   | 30.06.2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Goodwill                | 5,747        | 15             | -

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that its value may have been impaired. To perform these tests, goodwill is allocated by geographical area on the basis of asset groupings at the date of each business combination. These asset groupings correspond to groups of assets which jointly generate identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. If impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss for the financial year.\n\nGoodwill mainly stems from the acquisitions of Allied Domecq in July 2005 and Vin&Sprit in July 2008. The change in the value of goodwill in the period was mainly due to the acquisitions mentioned in Note 1.2.1 Significant events during the financial year -Acquisitions and disposals , as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n## Brands\n\nThe entry value of acquired brands is determined using an actuarial calculation of estimated future profits or using the royalty method and corresponds to the fair value of the brands at the date of acquisition. As the Group's brands are intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, they are not amortised but are rather subject to an impairment test at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that their value may have been impaired. Brands acquired as a part of acquisitions of foreign entities are denominated in the functional currency of the business acquired.\n\nThe main brands recorded on the balance sheet are: Absolut, Ballantine's, Beefeater, Chivas Regal, Kahl\u00faa, Malibu, Martell and Brancott Estate. Most of these were recognised at the time of the acquisitions of Seagram, Allied Domecq and Vin&Sprit. The change in the gross value of brands for the period was mainly due to the acquisitions mentioned in Note 1.2.1.1 Significant events during the financial year - Acquisitions and disposals , as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n## Impairment of tangible or intangible assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment tests whenever there is an indication that the value of the asset has been impaired and at least once a year for non-current assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill and brands).\n\nThe assets subject to impairment tests are included in cash generating units (CGUs), corresponding to linked groups of assets which generate identifiable cash flows. The CGUs include assets related to the Group's brands and are allocated in accordance with the three geographical areas defined by the Group, on the basis of the sale destination of the products. Impairment tests on CGUs are carried out in the third quarter and are regularly monitored until the reporting date in order to verify the relevance of the business plans and any changes to the market data underlying the discount rates used.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised within operating profit. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nValue in use is measured based on cash flows projected over a 19-year period. This period reflects the typically long lives of the Group's brands and their productive assets. Discounted projected cash flows are established based on annual budgets and multi-year strategies, extrapolated into subsequent years by gradually converging the figure for the last year of the Plan for each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal value derived by capitalising the cash flows generated in the last forecast year. Assumptions applied to sales and advertising and promotional expenditure are determined by Management based on previous results and long-term development trends in the markets concerned. The cash flow projection methodology takes into account, with respect to Working Capital Requirements and investments, the specific features of white spirits and maturing alcohols. The present values of discounted cash flows are sensitive to these assumptions, as well as to consumer trends and economic factors.\n\nMarket value is based either on the sale price, net of selling costs, that could be obtained under normal market conditions or earnings multiples observed in recent transactions relating to comparable assets. The discount rate used for these calculations is an after-tax rate applied to after-tax cash flows and corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital. This rate reflects specific rates for each market or region, depending on the risks that they represent. Assumptions made in terms of future changes in net sales and in terms of terminal values are reasonable and consistent with market data available for each of the CGUs. Additional impairment tests are applied where events or specific circumstances suggest that a potential impairment exists.\n\nIn addition to annual impairment tests applied to goodwill and brands, specific impairment tests are applied where there is an indication that the value of an asset may have been impaired.",

Fair value results and the disposal gain or loss are recorded, in accordance with the management intention, either (i) in the income statement under the heading 'Financial income/Financial expenses other non-recurring financial items' or (ii) in consolidated shareholder equity under the heading 'Other comprehensive income' and are not recycled through profit or loss.\n\nFair value is determined on the basis of the financial criteria most appropriate to the specific situation of each company. The fair value of financial assets listed on a financial market is their stock market value. The valuation criteria generally used for other non-consolidated investments are share of shareholder equity and future profitability.\n\n## Loans, guarantees and deposits\n\nLoans, guarantees and deposits are valued at amortised cost.\n\n|                                        | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022   | 30.06.2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20acmillion                               | Current      | Non-current  | Current      | Non-current  |\n| Net financial assets                   |              |              |              |              |\n| Shareholder equity instruments         | -            | 286          | -            | 345          |\n| Other financial assets                 | -            | 294          | -            | 247          |\n| Net loans and receivables              |              |              |              |              |\n| Loans, receivables and deposits        | -            | 106          | -            | 169          |\n| Total net non-current financial assets | -            | 685          | -            | 761          |\n| Derivative instruments                 | 8            | 65           | 32           | 4            |\n| Financial assets                       | 8            | 750          | 32           | 766          |\n\n6.",

Net realisable value is the selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale of inventories. Most inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method. The cost of long-cycle inventories is computed using a single method which includes distilling and ageing costs. These inventories are classified in current assets, although a substantial part remains in inventory for more than one year in order to undergo the ageing process used for certain wines and spirits before being sold.\n\nThe inventories and work-in-progress are broken down at closing as follow:\n\n## Movements of the period\n\n| \u20acmillion           | 30.06.2020   | Change in gross values   | Change in impairment   | Foreign currency gains and losses   | Other movements   | 30.06.2021   |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Raw materials      | 173          | 3                        | -

In the case where a potential obligation resulting from past events exists, but where the occurrence of the outflow of resources is not probable or where the amount cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed among the Group's commitments. The amounts provided for are measured by taking account of the most probable assumptions or using statistical methods, depending on the nature of the obligations. Provisions notably include:\n\n- provisions for restructuring; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- provisions for pensions and other long-term employee glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> benefits;\n- provisions for litigation (tax other than corporate income glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> tax, legal, employee-related).\n\nLitigation is kept under regular review, on a case-by-case basis, by the Legal Department of each affiliate or region or by the Group's Legal Department, drawing on the help of external legal consultants in the most significant or complex cases. A provision is recorded when it becomes probable that a present obligation arising from a past event will require an outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to settle this obligation.\n\n## Breakdown of provisions 1.\n\nThe breakdown of provisions at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n| \u20acmillion                                                      | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current provisions                                        |              |              |\n| Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits | 477          | 361          |\n| Other non-current provisions for risks and charges            | 253          | 318          |\n| Current provisions                                            |              |              |\n| Provisions for restructuring                                  | 50           | 27           |\n| Other current provisions for risks and charges                | 113          | 123          |\n| Total                                                         | 893          | 829          |\n\nThe cost of restructuring measures is fully provisioned in the financial year, and is recognised in profit and loss under 'Other operating income/(expenses)' when it is material and results from a Group obligation to third parties arising from a decision made by the competent corporate body that has been announced to the third parties concerned before the closing date. This cost mainly involves redundancy payments, early retirement payments, costs of notice periods not served, training costs of departing individuals and costs of site closure. Scrapping of property, plant and equipment, impairment of inventories and other assets, as well as other costs (moving costs, training of transferred individuals, etc.) directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. The amounts provided for correspond to forecast future payments to be made in connection with restructuring plans, discounted to present value when the payment schedule is such that the effect of the time value of money is significant.\n\n6.",

They are also subject to tax audits, some of which may lead to an adjustment. The main disputes are described in Note 6.5 Disputes .\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the provisions recorded by the Group for all litigation and risks in which it is involved amounted to \u20ac441 million, excluding uncertain tax positions recognised in current tax liabilities. The Group does not provide details (with exceptions), as it believes the disclosure of the amount of any provision booked in consideration of each pending dispute would be likely to cause serious harm to the Group.\n\nThe change in 'Other current and non-current provisions' during the period is explained as follows:\n\n- allowances stem mainly from proceedings brought against glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the Company and its affiliates, as part of the normal course of business and the emergence of new risks, including tax risks (other than corporate income tax risks);\n- reversals are made at the time of corresponding payments or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> where the risk is considered to be nil. Unused reversals primarily concern the re-evaluation or the statute of limitation of certain risks, including tax risks.\n\n## Provisions for pension benefits 3.\n\nIn accordance with applicable national legislation, the Group's employee benefit obligations are composed of:\n\n- long-term post-employment benefits (retirement glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> bonuses, pensions, medical and healthcare expenses, etc.);\n- long-term benefits payable during the period of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> employment.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nContributions are recognised as expenses as they are incurred. As the Group is not committed beyond the amount of such contributions, no provision is recognised in respect of defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the projected unit credit method is used to measure the present value of defined benefit obligations, current service cost and, if applicable, past service cost. The measurement is made at each closing date and the personal data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculation requires the use of economic assumptions (inflation rate and discount rate) and assumptions concerning employees (mainly average salary increase, rate of employee turnover and life expectancy). The assumptions used in FY21 and FY22 and the methods used for their determination are described below.\n\n- A provision is recorded in the balance sheet for the difference between the actuarial debt of related obligations (actuarial liabilities) and any assets dedicated to funding the plans, measured at their fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans has three components, which are accounted for as follows:\n\n- the cost of services is recognised in operating profit. It glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> includes:\n- the cost of services rendered during the period, glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the cost of past services resulting from the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> modification or reduction of a plan, fully recognised in profit and loss for the period in which the services were performed,\n- gains and losses resulting from liquidations; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the financial component, recorded in financial income glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (expenses), comprises the impact of discounting the liabilities, net of the expected return on plan assets, measured using the same discount rate as that used to measure the liabilities;\n- revaluations of liabilities (assets) are recognised as glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> non-recyclable items of comprehensive income, and consist mainly of actuarial differences, namely the change in plan obligations and assets due to changes in assumptions and to experience gains or losses, the latter representing the difference between the expected impact of some actuarial assumptions applied to previous valuations and the actual impact. Depending on the nature of the texts governing the plans in certain zones, if the hedging assets exceed the commitments entered into the accounts, any assets generated may be limited to the present value of the future reimbursements and the expected decreases in future contributions.\n\nThe Group grants pension and retirement benefits and other post-employment benefits (medical insurance or life insurance), in the form of defined contribution or defined benefit plans:\n\n- in France, benefit obligations mainly comprise arrangements glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> for retirement indemnities (non-funded) and supplementary pension benefits (partly funded);\n- in the United States and Canada, benefit obligations include glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> funded pension plans guaranteed to employees as well as unfunded post-employment medical plans;\n- in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, benefit glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> obligations mainly consist of pension plans granted to employees.",

        "page_content": "Defined benefit plans in the Group relate mainly to affiliates in the United Kingdom, in North America and in the rest of Europe. Defined benefit plans are subject to an annual actuarial valuation on the basis of assumptions depending on the country. Under these pension and other benefit plan agreements, employees receive at the date of retirement either a capital lump sum payment or an annuity. These amounts depend on the number of years of employment, final salary and the position held by the employee. At 30 June 2022, fully or partly funded benefit obligations totalled \u20ac4,022 million, equivalent to 94% of the total benefit obligations.\n\nCertain affiliates, mainly those located in North America, also provide their employees with post-employment medical cover. These benefit obligations are unfunded. They are measured using the same assumptions as those used for the pension obligations in the countries in question.\n\nSeveral affiliates, mainly in Europe, also provide their employees with other long-term benefits. Benefit obligations of this type are mainly in respect of long-service awards and jubilee awards.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the provision between 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2022:\n\n|                                                                   | 30.06.2021          | 30.06.2021                                   | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022          | 30.06.2022                                   | 30.06.2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| \u20acmillion                                                          | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        |\n| Net liability/(asset) at beginning of period                      | 196                 | 145                                          | 341          | 52                  | 140                                          | 192          |\n| Impacts of IFRIC IAS 19 interpretation                            |                     |                                              |              | (11)                | -

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Financial liabilities Note 4.8\n\nIFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) replaced IAS 39 as of 1 July 2018. IAS 32 has been applied since 1 July 2004. IFRS 7 has been applied since 1 July 2007. The amendment approved by the European Union on 22 November 2011 has been applied from 1 July 2011.\n\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are recognised, on the basis of their effective interest rates, in accordance with the amortised cost method. The effective interest rate includes all costs, commissions and fees payable under the contract between the parties. Under this method, costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are recognised in profit and loss on the basis of the effective interest rate.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7 (Statement of cash flows), cash and cash equivalents presented in assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and shown in the consolidated cash flow statements include items that are immediately available as cash or are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in their value. Cash is composed of cash at bank and on hand, short-term deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months and money market mutual funds that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in their value. Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity of less than three months. Bank overdrafts, which are considered to be equivalent to financing, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## IFRS 16 (Leases)\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys, at inception, the right to control the use of an identified asset for a set period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe lease liability is initially calculated at the present value of the future lease payments. The discount rates are based on the Group's borrowing rate plus a spread to take into account country-specific economic environments. They are estimated in each currency using available market data.\n\nThey take into account the term of the leases. Lease payments may include fixed or variable payments that depend on a rate or index known at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nThe period used to calculate the lease liability corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the contract, unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a renewal option beyond this period. The probability of exercising an option is determined on a lease-by-lease basis, taking into account Management's intentions. This liability is then calculated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet from the commencement date. They are presented in 'Lease liabilities' with a corresponding entry in 'Property, plant and equipment', depending on the nature of the underlying asset (see Note 4.1 Property, plant and equipment ). Lease liabilities comprise a current and non-current portion on the basis of the expected future payments.\n\nIn the income statement, depreciation expenses are recognised on the basis of the use of the underlying asset and interest expenses are presented in financial income/(expense).\n\nIn the cash flow statement, repayments of lease liabilities are reported under 'Lease repayments' in cash flows from financing activities, while interest payments are reported under 'Interest paid' in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nThe Group has chosen not to apply IFRS 16 to leases corresponding to assets with a low unit replacement value or to short-term leases. These leases are recognised directly in expenses.\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross debt (translated at the closing rate), including lease liabilities and fair value and net foreign currency assets hedged derivatives (hedging of net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.",

Accordingly, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is shown in the balance sheet if and only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and if it intends to settle the net amount. The assets and liabilities offset stem from the multi-currency cash pooling implemented within the Group.\n\n| At 30.06.2021 \u20acmillion    | Gross financial assets and liabilities   | Amounts offset in the balance sheet   | Net amounts in the balance sheet   | Impact of master netting agreements and similar agreements   | Financial instruments received as collateral   | Net amounts under IFRS 7   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Assets                    |                                          |                                       |                                    |                                                              |                                                |                            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 2,290                                    | (212)                                 | 2,078                              | -                                                            | -                                              | -                          |\n| Liabilities               |                                          |                                       |                                    |                                                              |                                                |                            |\n| Bank debt                 | 434                                      | (212)                                 | 222                                | -                                                            | -                                              | -                          |\n\n| At 30.06.2022 \u20acmillion    | Gross financial assets and liabilities   | Amounts offset in the balance sheet   | Net amounts in the balance sheet   | Impact of master netting agreements and similar agreements   | Financial instruments received as collateral   | Net amounts under IFRS 7   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Assets                    |                                          |                                       |                                    |                                                              |                                                |                            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 2,770                                    | (243)                                 | 2,527                              | -                                                            | -                                              | -                          |\n| Liabilities               |                                          |                                       |                                    |                                                              |                                                |                            |\n| Bank debt                 | 648                                      | (243)                                 | 405                                | -                                                            | -                                              | -                          |",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe methods used are as follows:\n\n- debt: the fair value of the debt is determined for each loan glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> by discounting future cash flows on the basis of market rates at the balance sheet date, adjusted for the Group's credit risk; for floating rate bank debt, fair value is approximately equal to the net carrying amount;\n- bonds: market liquidity enabled the Bonds to be valued at glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> their fair value using the quoted prices;\n- other long-term financial liabilities: the fair value of other glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> long-term financial liabilities is calculated for each loan by discounting future cash flows using an interest rate taking into account the Group's credit risk at the reporting date;\n- derivative instruments: the market value of instruments glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> recognised in the financial statements at the balance sheet date was calculated on the basis of available market data, using current valuation models.\n\nThe hierarchical levels for fair value disclosures below accord with the definitions in the amended version of IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures):\n\n- level 1: fair value based on prices quoted in an active market; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- level 2: fair value measured based on observable market data glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (other than quoted prices included in Level 1);\n- level 3: fair value determined by valuation techniques based glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> on unobservable market data.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, derivatives were measured taking into account the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and the Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA). The measurement is based on historical data (rating of counterparty banks and probability of default). At 30 June 2022, the impact was not significant.\n\n## Risk management 2.\n\nManagement and monitoring of financial risks is performed by the Financing and Treasury Department. Reporting to the Group Finance Department, it oversees all financial exposures and processes or validates all financing, investment and hedging transactions, as part of a programme approved by Senior Management.\n\nAll financial instruments used hedge existing or forecast hedge transactions or investments. They are contracted with a limited number of counterparties that have a first-class rating.\n\n## Management of liquidity risk\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group's cash and cash equivalents totalled \u20ac2,527 million (compared with \u20ac2,078 million at 30 June 2021). An additional \u20ac3,260 million of renewable medium-term credit facilities with banks was confirmed and undrawn. Group funding is provided in the form of long-term debt (bank loans, Bonds, etc.) and short-term financing (commercial paper and bank overdrafts) as well as factoring and securitisation, which provide adequate financial resources to ensure the continuity of its business. The Group also set up a \u20ac7 billion EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme in May 2020. The Group's short-term financial debt after hedging was \u20ac1,242 million at 30 June 2022 (compared to \u20ac192 million at 30 June 2021).\n\nWhile the Group has not identified any other significant cash requirement, it cannot be fully guaranteed that it will be able to continue to access the funding and refinancing needed for its day-to-day operations and investments on satisfactory terms, given the uncertain economic context.\n\nThe credit ratings sought by Pernod Ricard from rating agencies on its long- and short-term debt are Baa1/P2 from Moody's and BBB+/A2 from Standard & Poor's, respectively.\n\nThe Group's bank and bond debt contracts include covenants and a financial ratio. Breaches of these covenants or financial ratio could force the Group to make accelerated payments. At 30 June 2022, the Group was in compliance with the covenants under the terms of its syndicated loan, with a solvency ratio (total net debt converted at the average rate/consolidated EBITDA) of 5.25 or less.\n\nFurthermore, while the vast majority of the Group's cash surplus is placed with affiliates of global banks enjoying the highest agency ratings, it cannot be ruled out that these Group investments may lose some of their liquidity and/or value.\n\nThe currency controls in place in certain countries limit the Group's ability to use cash (prohibition on investment with the Group) and, in some cases, delay the possibility of paying dividends (authorisation is required from the relevant authorities, notably in Cuba). At 30 June 2022, the delayed availability cash amounted to \u20ac190 million, including \u20ac183 million relating to Cuba.\n\nSpecific terms of financing agreements and the schedule of financial liability maturity are respectively disclosed in the 'Material contracts' subsection of the management report and in Note 4.8 -Financial liabilities of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Management of currency risk\n\nAs the Group consolidates its financial statements in euros, it is exposed to fluctuations against the euro by the currencies in which its assets and liabilities are denominated (asset risk) or in which transactions are carried out (transaction risk and translation of results).\n\nWhile some hedging strategies allow exposure to be limited, there is no absolute protection against exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nFor asset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural hedging. This principle was applied for the acquisition of Seagram, Allied Domecq and Vin&Sprit, with part of the debt being denominated in USD, reflecting the importance of cash flows generated in dollars or linked currencies.\n\nMovements in currencies against the euro (notably the USD) may impact the nominal amount of these debts and the financial expense published in euros in the consolidated financial statements, and this could adversely affect the Group's results.\n\nFor operational currency risk, the Group's international operations expose it to currency risks affecting transactions carried out by affiliates in a currency other than their operating currency (transaction accounting risk).\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency of the distributing entity. Exposure to currency risk on invoicing between producer and distributor affiliates is managed via a monthly payment centralisation procedure involving most countries with freely convertible and transferable currencies and whose internal legislation allows this participation. This system hedges against net exposure using forward exchange contracts.",

In order to limit this exposure, the Group performs a rigorous selection of counterparties according to several criteria, including credit ratings, and depending on the maturity dates of the transactions.\n\nHowever, no assurance can be given that this rigorous selection will be enough to protect the Group against risks of this type, particularly in the current economic context.\n\n6.",

If the derivative is designated as a hedge of a net foreign currency investment, the change in value of the 'effective' portion of the hedge is recognised in shareholder equity and the change in value of the 'ineffective' portion is recognised in profit and loss.\n\n## Hedging instruments (by risk category and nature of hedge)\n\n|                                                                          |                                               | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   |       | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|\n| Type of hedge at 30.06.2021 \u20acmillion                                     | Description of financial instrument           | < 1 year                       | > 1 year and < 5 years         | > 5 years                      | Total | Assets       | Liabilities  |\n| Fair value hedge                                                         |                                               |                                |                                |                                |       | 22           | -

Most of these other current liabilities are due within one year.\n\n## Notes to the cash flow statement Note 5\n\n## Working Capital Requirement 1.\n\nWorking Capital Requirements increased by +\u20ac252 million. It is mainly explained as follows:\n\n- inventory: +\u20ac632 million; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- trade receivables: +\u20ac185 million; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- trade payables: \u20ac(550) million; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- others: \u20ac(15) million. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\n## Acquisitions of financial investments and 2. activities\n\nThe acquisitions of financial investments and activities net of disposals generated a cash outflow of \u20ac(723) million, mainly related to acquisitions and disposals of activities in the period, related in particular to the transactions described in paragraph 1.1 of Note 1.2 Significant events during the financial year .\n\n## Additional information Note 6\n\n## Shareholder equity Note 6.1\n\n## Share capital 1.\n\nIn April 2022, the Group reduced its share capital by cancelling 3,929,205 shares previously held that were acquired under the Group's share buyback programme. Following this transaction, the capital changed to \u20ac399,818,400, divided into 257,947,355 shares with a par value of \u20ac1.55 each:\n\n|                             | Number of shares   |   Amount \u20acmillion |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Share capital on 30.06.2021 | 261,876,560        |               406 |\n| Share capital on 30.06.2022 | 257,947,355        |               400 |\n\nAll Pernod Ricard shares are issued and fully paid for a nominal value of \u20ac1.55. Only one category of Pernod Ricard shares exists. These shares obtain double voting rights if they have been nominally registered for an uninterrupted period of 10 years.\n\n## Bond issues/repayment of debt 3.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Pernod Ricard Group carried out bond issuance/subscriptions for \u20ac1,564 million and repayment of debt for \u20ac493 million. These transactions mainly correspond to the bond subscriptions and redemptions described in paragraph 1.2 of Note 1.2 Significant events during the financial year .\n\nIn addition, the Group increased the stock of commercial paper for \u20ac173 million.\n\nThe Group also paid \u20ac127 million in respect of its lease liabilities, of which \u20ac115 million related to repayment of the nominal amount and \u20ac12 million to interest payments reported in cash flows from operating activities.\n\n6.",

        "page_content": "## Treasury shares 2.\n\nTreasury shares are recognised on acquisition as a deduction from equity. Subsequent changes in the value of treasury shares are not recognised. When treasury shares are sold, any difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the shares at the date of disposal is recognised as a change in shareholder equity and has no impact on profit and loss for the year.\n\nOn 30 June 2022, Pernod Ricard and its controlled affiliates held 1,014,620 Pernod Ricard shares for a value of \u20ac146 million. These treasury shares are reported, at cost, as a deduction from shareholder equity.\n\nAs part of its stock option and bonus share allocation plans, Pernod Ricard SA holds shares either directly (treasury shares) or indirectly (calls or repurchase options). These shares may be allocated if options are exercised under the stock option plans or, in the case of bonus shares, if performance targets are met.\n\n## Interim dividend 3.\n\nAt its meeting of 27 April 2022, the Board of Directors decided to pay an interim dividend of \u20ac1.56 per share in respect of FY22, i.e. a total of \u20ac401 million. The interim dividend was paid on 8 July 2022 and recognised under 'Other current liabilities' in the balance sheet at 30 June 2022.\n\n## Capital management 4.\n\nThe Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise its cost of capital and profitability for its shareholders, provide security for all its counterparties and maintain a high rating. In this context, the Group may adjust its payment of dividends to shareholders, repay part of its capital, buy back its treasury shares and authorise share-based payment plans.\n\n## Liquidity agreement 5.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, Pernod Ricard SA put in place a 12-month liquidity agreement, effective from 1 June 2012, through Rothschild & Cie Banque. The agreement is tacitly renewable for successive periods of 12 months. It complies with the French Financial Markets Association (AMAFI) Code of Ethics, which was approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in its decision of 21 March 2011.\n\nThe sum of \u20ac5 million was allocated for the implementation of the liquidity agreement.\n\n## Share-based payments Note 6.2\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 2 (Share-based payments) to transactions whose award and settlement are share-based.\n\nPursuant to this standard, stock options and performance shares granted to employees are measured at fair value. The amount of such fair value is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the rights and a corresponding double entry is recognised as an increase in shareholder equity.\n\nThis fair value was calculated using valuation models taking into account the characteristics of the plan and market data at the date of grant and on the basis of Group Management assumptions.\n\n## Description of share-based payment plans\n\nThe Group grants long-term incentive plans to high-level executives, key Group executives and high-potential managers. As of the grant on 10 November 2022, these plans are granted through shares, whether or not subject to internal or external performance conditions; the stock option mechanism is no longer used for new allocations. In addition, for all plans granted during the financial year, the presence condition was revised to three years instead of the four years previously in force.\n\nIn the course of FY22, three share allocation plans were set up on 10 November 2021:\n\n- a performance share plan including: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- a performance condition based on the positioning of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR (1) ) compared to the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers over the period from 13 October 2021 to 13 October 2024 inclusive (three years),\n- a performance condition based on the average level of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> profit from recurring operations compared to budget, measured over three consecutive financial years, including that in which the shares were allocated,\n- a condition relating to the achievement of Corporate Social glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Responsibility (CSR) targets measured over three consecutive financial years, including that in which the shares were allocated;\n- a performance share plan including: glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- a performance condition based on the average level of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Profit from Recurring Operations compared to budget, measured over three consecutive financial years, including that in which the shares were allocated,\n- a condition relating to the achievement of Corporate Social glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Responsibility (CSR) targets measured over three consecutive financial years, including that in which the shares were allocated;\n- a share plan without performance conditions. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>",

        "page_content": "For one of the plans, part of the grant is contingent on the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR (1) ) compared to the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers: the shares will be pre-vested on 10 November 2023 provided that the positioning of the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR (1) ) is equal to or greater than 7 th position out of 13 (the number will be determined in stages according to the level of performance achieved). The other part of the allocation of this plan is subject to an internal performance condition, the achievement of which will depend on the average of the Group's profit from recurring operations for the financial years ended 30 June 2022, 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024 compared to the budgeted profit from recurring operations for each financial year, at constant exchange rates and scope. The fair value here corresponds to the market price of the share on the grant date, less the loss of dividends expected during the vesting period ( i.e. three years for all beneficiaries) and includes the probability of achieving the TSR performance condition. The IFRS 2 accounting expense of the plan will be adjusted at the latest at the end of the vesting period in relation to this condition.\n\nThe fair value of the other two plans (with and without internal performance conditions) corresponds to the market price of the share at the grant date, less the loss of dividends expected during the vesting period ( i.e. three years for all beneficiaries).\n\nFor all these plans, vesting will be definitive if the presence condition is validated on 10 November 2024.\n\n## Employee share ownership plan\n\nIn the spring of 2022, employees in 24 markets ( i.e. around 80% of the Group's employees) had the opportunity to participate in the Pernod Ricard share ownership plan, as part of a structured offer, including in particular a 20% discount on the reference share price.\n\nThe acquisition price was set at \u20ac156.14, corresponding to 80% of the average opening share price over the 20 trading sessions preceding the Chairman & CEO's decision, i.e. from 19 April to 9 May 2022.\n\nAt 13 May 2022, date of the end of the vesting/withdrawal period, all shares available under this offer (525,183) had been subscribed by the employees of the affiliates present in the 24 markets participating in the plan.\n\nThe IFRS 2 expense measuring the benefit offered to employees is measured with reference to the fair value of a discount offered on non-transferable shares.\n\nThe IFRS 2 expense recognised in respect of this plan in the FY22 consolidated financial statements amounts to \u20ac6.0 million.\n\nThis plan did not result in a capital increase, as the shares concerned were bought back by the Group on the secondary market during the FY22 financial year; the employee contribution was also made over the financial year.\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments Note 6.3\n\n| \u20acmillion                                                       | Total   | < 1 year   | > 1 year and < 5 years   | > 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Commitments given at 30.06.2021                                | 2,340   | 870        | 1,332                    | 138         |\n| Commitments given in relation to companies within the Group    | 3       | 1          | 1                        | -           |\n| Investment commitments                                         | 3       | 1          | 1                        | -           |\n| Commitments given as part of specific transactions             | -       | -          | -                        | -           |\n| Other                                                          | -       | -          | -                        | -           |\n| Commitments given in relation to the financing of the Company  | 29      | 22         | 1                        | 6           |\n| Financial guarantees given                                     | 29      | 22         | 1                        | 6           |\n| Other                                                          | -       | -          | -                        | -           |\n| Commitments relating to the operating activities of the issuer | 2,308   | 846        | 1,330                    | 133         |\n| Firm and irrevocable commitments to purchase raw materials     | 2,006   | 628        | 1,307                    | 70          |\n| Tax commitments (customs guarantees and others)                | 249     | 179        | 9                        | 61          |\n| Operating lease agreements                                     | 10      | 4          | 4                        | 1           |\n| Other                                                          | 44      | 34         | 9                        | 1           |\n\n6.",

        "page_content": "## Lines of credit received and not used 1.\n\nThe lines of credit received and not used correspond primarily to the nominal amounts of the syndicated loan and a bilateral credit line not drawn at 30 June 2022 (see Note 4.8 Financial liabilities ).\n\n## Firm and irrevocable commitments to purchase 2. raw materials\n\nIn the context of their cognac, wine, champagne and whisky production, the Group's main affiliates have signed raw material supply agreements for eaux-de-vie , grapes, base wines and grain in the amount of \u20ac2,213 million.\n\n## Contingent liabilities Note 6.4\n\nPernod Ricard has received several notices of tax adjustment for the financial years 2007 to 2018, specifically concerning, for an amount of 9,037 million Indian rupees (equivalent to \u20ac110.6 million, including interest as of the date of the reassessment), the tax deductibility of promotion and advertising expenses. It should be noted that the level and amount of this risk have been gradually and significantly reduced in recent years and that the Company obtained two court rulings in its favour in FY20 for the period from FY07 to FY14. These court decisions further strengthen Pernod Ricard India's position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses. Reassured by these decisions and after consulting with its tax advisers, Pernod Ricard India will continue to dispute the merits of the reassessment proposal and believes it has a probable chance of success in litigation. Accordingly, no provision has been booked for this matter.\n\nThe tax authorities conducted a special audit for financial year 2017 and made tax adjustments for an amount of 2,398 million Indian rupees (equivalent to \u20ac29.2 million) on various grounds. Pernod Ricard has challenged the order before the higher appellate forum and believes it has strong chances of relief from the appellate authorities.\n\n## Disputes Note 6.5\n\nIn the normal course of business, Pernod Ricard is involved in a number of legal, governmental, arbitration and administrative proceedings.\n\nA provision for such procedures is constituted under 'Other provisions for risks and charges' (see Note 4.7 Provisions ) only when it is likely that a current liability stemming from a past event will require the payment of an amount that can be reliably estimated. In the latter case, the provisioned amount corresponds to the best estimation of the risk. The provisioned amount recorded is based on the assessment of the level of risk on a case by case basis, it being understood that any events arising during the proceedings may at any time require that risk to be reassessed.\n\nThe provisions recorded by Pernod Ricard at 30 June 2022 for all litigation and risks in which it is involved amounted to \u20ac441 million, compared with \u20ac366 million at 30 June 2021\n\n(see Note 4.7 Provisions ), excluding uncertain tax positions recognised in Income tax payable. Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other than in exceptional circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no other governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings pending or threatened, including any proceeding of which the Company is aware, which may have or have had over the last 12 months a significant impact on the profitability of the Company and/or the Group, other than those described below.\n\n## Disputes relating to brands\n\n## Havana Club\n\nThe Havana Club brand is owned in most countries by a joint venture company called Havana Club Holding SA (HCH), of which Pernod Ricard is a shareholder, and is registered in over 160 countries in which the Havana Club rum is distributed. In the United States, this brand is owned by a Cuban company (Cubaexport). Ownership of this brand is currently being challenged in the United States by a competitor of Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn 1998, the United States passed a law relating to the conditions for the protection of brands previously used by nationalised companies. This law was condemned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002. However, to date, the United States has not amended its legislation to comply with the WTO decision.\n\n- The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 1. decided that this law had the effect of preventing any renewal of the US trademark registration for the Havana Club brand, which, in the United States, has been owned by Cubaexport since 1976, without obtaining a specific licence from OFAC. In August 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) denied the renewal of the said Havana Club trademark registration, following OFAC's refusal to grant a specific licence. Cubaexport petitioned the Director of the USPTO to reverse this decision and also filed a claim against the OFAC, challenging both OFAC's decision and the law and regulations applied by OFAC. In& March 2009, the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against Cubaexport. In March 2011, in a two-to-one decision, the Court of Appeals blocked Cubaexport from renewing its trademark. A certiorari petition was filed before the US Supreme Court on 27 January 2012, with the support of the French government, the National Foreign Trade Council and the Washington Legal Foundation. On 14 May 2012, the Supreme Court denied the petition. In November 2015, Cubaexport again applied for a specific licence from OFAC to renew the trademark in the United States. On 11 January 2016, OFAC granted Cubaexport's licence application and on 13 January 2016, the application to the Director of USPTO was declared admissible and the trademark was renewed for the 10-year period ending on 27 January 2016. A request for a further renewal for a period of 10 years from 27 January 2016 was also granted.\n\n6.",

        "page_content": "- A competitor of the Group has petitioned the USPTO to 2. cancel the Havana Club trademark registration in the United States. In January 2004, the USPTO denied the petition and refused to cancel the trademark registration. As this decision was appealed, proceedings are now ongoing before the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (DC Court). These proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of Cubaexport's petition to the USPTO. Following acceptance of the petition by the Director of the USPTO, these judicial proceedings resumed and the plaintiff amended the complaint. In response, Cubaexport and HCH filed two motions in 2016: one to dismiss all actions commenced against them and one to expedite proceedings on certain issues. Both applications have been fully disclosed and are awaiting a decision by the Court. In February 2021, HCH and Cubaexport filed a notice of supplemental authority with the DC Court. To date, after the filing of our notice of supplemental authority, the case is no longer listed as stayed on the DC Court's docket. We are now waiting for the Court's order on the two motions.\n\nThese risks constitute a potential obstacle to the Group's business development but there are no foreseeable obligations resulting from these events at the present time. The resolution of these disputes would represent a business development opportunity for the Group.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThe Group's companies are regularly audited by the tax authorities in the countries in which they are registered.\n\nThe assessment of the risk related to each tax dispute is regularly reviewed by the affiliate or region concerned and by the Group's Tax Department, with the assistance of external counsel for the most significant or complex cases. Provisions are recognised if necessary. Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other than in exceptional circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing tax litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\n## India\n\nPernod Ricard India (P) Ltd has an ongoing dispute with the Indian customs authorities over the declared transaction value of concentrates of alcoholic beverages (CAB) imported into India. Customs are challenging the transaction values, arguing that some competitors used different values for the import of similar goods. This matter was ruled on by the Supreme Court which issued an order in July 2010, setting out the principles applicable for the determination of values which should be taken into account for the calculation of duty. Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd has already paid the corresponding amounts up to 2001. For the period between 2001 and December 2010, Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd has paid almost the entire differential duty as determined by customs in Delhi following the initial adjustment notice received in 2011. A second notice received in 2013 and confirmed by a court on 14 August 2017\n\nhas been suspended by the Supreme Court. With regard to imports of alcoholic beverage concentrate (CAB) since 2011, the Indian authorities have issued opinions and reports disputing the values of the transactions. The Group continues to work actively with the authorities and the courts to resolve outstanding issues.\n\nPernod Ricard India (P) is also involved in a debate with the Indian customs authorities over the transaction value of international products imported into India. Discussions are ongoing with the relevant authorities and jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, Pernod Ricard India (P) received several notices of tax adjustment for FY07 to FY18 relating to the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses (see Note 6.4 Contingent liabilities ). In FY20, Pernod Ricard India (P) obtained two court rulings in its favour for the period from FY07 to FY14, strengthening its position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses.\n\nIt should be noted that the above-mentioned disputes are only the subject of provisions, which, where appropriate, are recorded in other provisions for risks and charges (see Note 4.7 -Provisions ) or in current tax liabilities (see Note 3.3 -Corporate income tax ), when it is probable that a present obligation resulting from a past event will require a settlement the amount of which can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to extinguish this liability.\n\n## Commercial disputes\n\n## Colombia\n\nA complaint was filed before the Colombian Competition Agency (the Superintendencia De Industria Y Comercio) on 14 November 2017 by the Department of Cundinamarca and its wholly owned distilling company Empresa de Licores de Cundinamarca against Pernod Ricard SA, Pernod Ricard Colombia SA and a competitor company. In late December 2020, Pernod Ricard Colombia received notice of a similar complaint, initially filed in September 2019 by the departments of Valle and Antioquia (as well as its wholly-owned distillation companies). The complaint alleges that the defendants have committed violations of the Colombian Unfair Competition Act and, in particular, articles 7 and 18 thereof, through the illegal import of spirits into Colombia. The complaints allege that the companies have gained an unfair market advantage over local producers through such activity. The plaintiffs seek damages corresponding to the loss of profits and taxes over the period 2013/17 (2019 in the case of Valle and Antioquia).\n\nPernod Ricard intends to vigorously defend itself against such allegations. This recent complaint contains allegations that are similar to those made in prior legal proceedings before the New York courts brought by Cundinamarca, the Republic of Colombia and several other Colombian departments in 2004. The New York proceedings were dismissed voluntarily by the parties in 2012.",

Control is the power to influence the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, irrespective of the percentage held in the entity.

Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Pernod Ricard S.A. for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements ' section of our report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\n## Brands' valuation\n\n(Notes 1.1.4, 1.2.4, 3.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nAs of 30 June 2022, indefinite-life brands were recorded in the balance sheet for a net carrying amount of \u20ac11,301 million, i.e. 31% of total assets.\n\nCash Generating Units (\"CGUs\") are defined as the brand and all assets required to generate the cash flows associated with the brand. An impairment loss is recorded when their net carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. Their recoverable amount is determined as part of mandatory annual impairment tests given their indefinite life and/or specific tests required in the event of an indication of a loss in value. Recoverable amounts are generally determined based on discounted future cash flow calculations and involve significant management judgments of components such as price and volume growth rates, the timing of future operating expenses and discount and long-term growth rates.\n\nIn addition, and as indicated in Note 1.2.4, given the high level of uncertainty related to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, future cash flows from the region have been excluded from the calculations of the recoverable amounts of CGUs.\n\nBased on its annual impairment tests results, the Company recorded an impairment loss before tax of \u20ac10 million for the year ended 30 June 2022, as disclosed in Notes 3.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- assessing the principles and methods of calculating CGUs' glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> accounting and recoverable amounts, notably the exclusion of future cash flows arising from the Russo-Ukrainian region from the calculations of the recoverable amounts of CGUs;\n- testing the operation of Group controls covering the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> calculation of CGUs' recoverable amounts;\n- for CGUs with a recoverable amount close to their carrying glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> amount ('sensitive brands' CGUs'), confirming the results of the valuation model used by management by comparing them with the results of our models;\n- corroborating the reasonableness of the main data and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> assumptions underlying the estimates (such as the discount rates and long-term growth rates), primarily for 'sensitive brands' CGUs', especially with regard to available market analyses and in relation to economic environments where the Group operates;\n- being informed of the commercial outlook of the brands based glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> on interviews with management and comparing the accounting estimates of prior period cash flow projections with corresponding actual values to assess reliability;\n- testing the arithmetical accuracy of the valuations used by the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> Company on a sample basis;\n- assessing management's sensitivity analysis on recoverable glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> amounts to changes in main assumptions.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from 1 July 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce ') relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

The tax authorities of the countries in which the Group companies operate regularly have queries on issues relating to their everyday activities. Tax audits can therefore give rise to tax reassessments and litigation with these tax authorities. The assessment of the risk related to each tax litigation is regularly reviewed by each concerned subsidiary or region and by the Group's tax department, with the support of its external counsels for the most significant and complex litigations. Part of the amount of provisions for contingences for all legal disputes or risks involving the Group relate to tax risks and litigation.\n\nMore particularly, the Indian subsidiary is involved in disputes with customs and tax authorities over, among others, the declared transaction value of imported products into India and the tax deductibility of promotional and advertising expenses. As indicated in the Note 6.5 'Disputes', the reassessment proposals are only the subject of provisions or income tax payables where appropriate, when it is likely that a current liability resulting from a past event will require an outflow of resources which can be reliably estimated.\n\nGiven the Group's exposure to tax issues, which are in part specific to its business sector, and the high level of management judgment in estimating the risks and amounts recorded, we considered tax risks to be a key audit matter and the understatement of the corresponding provisions to be a possible source of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce ') is included in the Group's information given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L.823-10 of the code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and this information should be reported by an independent third party.\n\nBased on discussions with management, we have been informed of the procedures implemented by the Group to identify uncertain tax positions and, where necessary, provide for tax risks or income tax payables.\n\nIn addition, we assessed the judgments made by management in evaluating the probability of taxes being payable, the amount of potential exposure and the reasonableness of the estimates adopted for provisions for tax risks or income tax payables. We particularly focused on the impact of changes in local tax regulations and ongoing audits conducted by local tax authorities. To assess whether the tax liabilities were appropriately recognized, and with the assistance of our tax experts, we:\n\n- conducted interviews with the Group's tax department and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> regional and local management teams in order to assess the current state of the investigations and reassessments made by tax authorities and monitor the development of ongoing tax disputes;\n- consulted the recent Group company decisions and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> correspondence with local tax authorities, and reviewed the correspondence between the relevant companies and their lawyers, where necessary;\n- analysed lawyers' responses to our information requests; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- performed a critical review of the estimates and positions glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> adopted by management;\n- assessed whether the latest developments were taken into glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> account in the provisions recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes 1.1.4, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation N\u00b0 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n6.",

        "page_content": "Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Pernod Ricard by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 13 May 2003 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and on 17 November 2016 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG S.A. were in the 19 th year and 6 th year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce '), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Analysis of Pernod Ricard SA income statement 7.4 and balance sheet\n\n## Relations between the Parent 7.4.1 Company and its affiliates\n\nThe main role of Pernod Ricard SA, the Group's Parent Company, is to carry out general interest and coordination activities in strategy, financial control of affiliates, external growth, marketing, development, research, human resources and communication. Pernod Ricard SA's financial relations with its affiliates mainly involve the billing of royalties for the operation of brands owned by Pernod Ricard SA, various billings and the receipt of dividends.\n\n## Income statement and balance 7.4.2 sheet as at 30 June 2022\n\n## Analysis of FY22 income statement\n\nOperating income represented an amount of \u20ac397 million as at 30 June 2022, i.e. an increase of \u20ac79 million compared to 30 June 2021, partly due to an increase of \u20ac72 million in net sales (see Note 17).\n\nThe amount of operating expenses as at 30 June 2022 was \u20ac(512) million compared with \u20ac(406) million in the previous financial year, i.e. an increase in expenses of \u20ac(106) million.\n\nThe operating result was a loss of \u20ac(115) million in the year ended 30 June 2022, a deterioration of \u20ac(27) million compared with the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nFinancial income/(expense) amounted to \u20ac1,808 million at 30 June 2022 compared to \u20ac726 million at 30 June 2021, i.e. an increase of \u20ac1,082 million (see Note 18).\n\nExceptional items at 30 June 2022 represented an expense of \u20ac(3) million.\n\nLastly, income tax comprised tax income of \u20ac145 million related to the effects of the tax consolidation in FY22.\n\nAs a result, net profit for FY22 was \u20ac1,835 million.\n\nThe Covid-19 health crisis and the Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a significant impact on the results of the Pernod Ricard SA entity.\n\n## Analysis of the FY22 balance sheet\n\n## Assets\n\nTotal net fixed assets stood at \u20ac13,243 million at 30 June 2022 compared with \u20ac13,147 million for the previous financial year, i.e. a increase of \u20ac(97) million. The main changes observed are as follows:\n\n- an increase of \u20ac22 million in intangible assets; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- an increase of \u20ac73 million in financial investments glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (see Note 3).\n\nCurrent assets amounted to \u20ac2,107 million during the financial year, an increase of \u20ac515 million compared to 30 June 2021.\n\nPrepaid expenses and deferred charges, amounting to \u20ac397 million, consist of the items Unrealised foreign exchange losses and Bond redemption premiums.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nShareholder equity amounted to \u20ac6,128 million at 30 June 2022, compared with \u20ac5,905 million at 30 June 2021. The main movements for the period were:\n\n- profit for the financial year of \u20ac1,835 million; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the payment of the balance of the dividend for FY21 of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> \u20ac347 million;\n- the payment of an interim dividend of \u20ac1.56 per share in glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> respect of FY22, amounting to \u20ac401 million. This interim dividend was paid on 8 July 2022;\n- the continuation of the share buyback programme with the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> cancellation of the shares bought back for a total amount of \u20ac752 million;\n- the impact of the application of the IFRIC directive relating to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), concerning the allocation of employee benefits, had the effect of reducing the amount of the pension obligation provisioned by \u20ac6.5 million (see Note 1.8 Pensions and other long-term employee benefits).\n\nThe amount of provisions for risks and charges was \u20ac380 million, a reduction of \u20ac36 million.\n\nDuring the period, borrowings increased by \u20ac1,024 million. This was mainly due to:\n\n- the contracting of two new bonds of \u20ac500 million and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> \u20ac750 million and the repayment of a bond of \u20ac500 million;\n- the change in accrued interest for \u20ac0.4 million; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the impact of foreign exchange on debts in dollars of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> \u20ac272 million.\n\nOperating payables amounted to \u20ac717 million, a decrease of \u20ac579 million, mainly due to:\n\n- the increase of \u20ac44 million in accounts payable; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- the change in miscellaneous debts, including \u20ac671 million on glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the intra-group current account and \u20ac54 million on the dividends payable account.\n\nThe deferred income and adjustment account of \u20ac293 million at 30 June 2022 comprised the \u20ac169 million increase in the value of unrealised foreign exchange gains compared with 30 June 2021.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Pernod Ricard SA separate financial statements\n\n## Accounting policies Note 1\n\nThe annual financial statements for the period are prepared in accordance with the policies of French GAAP, which apply under Regulation 2014-03 of the French Accounting Standards Body (ANC) of 5 June 2014 and all rules subsequently amended. The general accounting conventions have been applied, in compliance with the principle of prudence, in accordance with the following base assumptions:\n\n- going concern; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- consistency of accounting policies from one financial year to glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the next;\n- accruals basis of accounting; and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- in accordance with the general rules of drawing up and glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> presenting the annual financial statements.\n\nThe basic method used to measure items recorded in the balance sheet is based on historical cost.\n\n## Intangible assets 1.\n\nThe brands acquired from the merger of Pernod and Ricard in 1975 and from subsequent mergers are the Company's main intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost; depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life.\n\nAs part of its digital transformation, Pernod Ricard SA has developed tools to use data generated by the Group's various activities. This production of algorithms falls within the scope of the accounting regulations for internally generated intangible assets. Development costs are recognised as intangible assets from the date on which the technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the human and material resources are sufficient to produce these tools. The amount recognised as intangible assets relating to these projects represented an amount of \u20ac19.6 million for FY22. The amortisation period is five years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment 2.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost (purchase price plus ancillary costs but not including fees incurred in connection with asset purchases). Impairment is calculated using the straight-line or declining-balance methods, on the basis of the estimated useful lives of the assets:\n\n- buildings: between 20 and 50 years (straight-line); glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- building fixtures and fittings: 10 years (straight-line); glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- equipment: 5 years (straight-line); glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- furniture, office equipment: 10 years (straight-line) or 4 years glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (reducing balance).\n\n## Financial investments 3.\n\nThe gross value of investments is composed of their acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf the value in use of investments is lower than their acquisition cost, a provision for impairment is recognised in financial income/(expense) for the amount of the difference.\n\nPernod Ricard SA mainly uses two methods to estimate the value in use of its equity investments:\n\n- the enterprise value of the main securities is estimated on the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> basis of the most recent estimate of the revalued net asset value, by identifying in particular the unrealised capital gains on assets held by the affiliates, such as the brands. The adjusted net asset value is assessed based on methods such as the discounted cash flow method. The term of the cash flow projections reflects the characteristics of the Group's brands and their production assets. Discounted projected\n\ncash flows are established based on annual budgets and multi-year strategies, extrapolated to subsequent years by gradually converging the growth for the last year of the plan for each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal value derived by capitalising the cash flows generated in the last forecast year;\n\n- for other equity investments, value in use is estimated based glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> on the share of the affiliate's shareholder equity represented by the investment.\n\n## Receivables 4.\n\nReceivables are recognised at their nominal value. A provision is recognised in the event that their value falls below the net carrying amount at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Marketable securities 5.\n\nThis item includes the treasury shares acquired for the allocation of stock option and performance share plans from the time of acquisition.\n\nA liability is recognised when it becomes probable that the rights to receive the marketable securities concerned under the plans will be exercised. For other marketable securities, an impairment provision is recognised when the cost price is higher than the market price.\n\n## Bonds 6.\n\nRedemption premiums are amortised over the life of the loans.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges 7.\n\nProvisions for risks and charges are recognised in accordance with French Accounting Regulation 2000-06 on liabilities, issued on 7 December 2000 by the French Accounting Regulatory Committee (CRC).\n\nThis accounting regulation provides that a liability be recognised when an entity has an obligation towards a third party and that it is probable or certain that this obligation will cause an outflow of resources to the third party without equivalent consideration being received. A present obligation must exist at the reporting date for a provision to be recognised.\n\n## Pensions and other long-term employee 8. benefits\n\nSince the year ended on 30 June 2014, the Company has opted to recognise the full liability for pensions and other long-term employee benefits in the balance sheet, as provided by recommendation 2013-02. At 30 June 2022, the provision for pensions and other long-term employee benefits was \u20ac50 million.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, the Group finalised the calculation of the impacts related to the first-time application of the decision published by the IFRIC in April 2021 relating to IAS 19 'Employee benefits' and the attribution of employee benefits to periods of service. This decision clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed in allocating the IAS 19 expense. The Company has chosen, in accordance with the ANC update of 17 November 2021 to its Recommendation No. 2013-02 of 7 November 2013 on the rules for valuing and recognising pension commitments and similar benefits, to also apply this accounting method for its financial statements prepared in accordance with French accounting principles. This change constitutes a change in accounting method and has the effect of reducing by \u20ac6.5 million the amount of the pension commitment provisioned at 30 June 2021 in the annual financial statements of Pernod Ricard SA through the counterparty of retained earnings, which was increased by the same amount.",

The measurement is made at each balance sheet date and the personal data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculation requires the use of economic assumptions (inflation rate and discount rate) and assumptions concerning employees (mainly average salary increase, rate of employee turnover and life expectancy).\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the total amount of benefit obligations was \u20ac50 million. These obligations are fully provisioned.\n\nFor information, the inflation rate used for the valuation at 30 June 2022 was 2.00% and the discount rate was 1.75%.\n\nPlan assets are measured at their market value at each balance sheet date.\n\n## Accounting for actuarial gains and losses\n\nActuarial gains and losses arise primarily when estimates differ from actual outcomes, or when there are changes in long-term actuarial assumptions ( e.g. discount rate, rate of increase of salaries, etc.).\n\nThe Company has applied the option set out in recommendation 2013-02, in which the full pension liability is recognised, since the financial year ended 30 June 2014.\n\n## Components of the expense recognised for the financial year\n\nThe expense recognised in respect of the benefit obligations described above incorporates:\n\n- expenses corresponding to the acquisition of an additional glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> year's rights;\n- interest expense arising on the unwinding of the discount glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> applied to vested rights at the start of the year (as a result of the passage of time);\n- income corresponding to the expected return on plan assets glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> measured using the discount rate which is used to measure plan liabilities;\n- income or expense corresponding to actuarial gains or losses; glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n- income or expense related to changes to existing plans or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> the creation of new plans;\n- the income or expense related to any plan curtailments or glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> settlements.\n\n## Deferred income and adjustment accounts Note 10\n\n| \u20acthousand                                                         | At 30.06.2021   | Increases   | Decreases   | At 30.06.2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Deferred income                                                   | 18,989          | -           | (2,696)     | 16,293          |\n| Unrealised foreign exchange gains (1) (see breakdown in Note 1.9) | 124,000         | 293,234     | (124,000)   | 293,234         |\n| Total                                                             | 142,989         | 293,234     | (126,696)   | 309,527         |\n\n## Accrued income and expenses Note 11\n\n## Accrued income\n\n| \u20acthousand                                                     | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Amount of accrued income in the following balance sheet items |              |              |\n| Loans and advances to affiliates and associates               | 53,536       | 59,370       |\n| Trade receivables                                             | 338,459      | 457,204      |\n| Other receivables                                             | 1,036,227    | 1,205,107    |\n| Cash                                                          | 93,028       | 312,516      |\n| Total                                                         | 1,521,251    | 2,034,197    |\n\n## Accrued expenses\n\n| \u20acthousand                                                       | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Amount of accrued expenses in the following balance sheet items |              |              |\n| Bank debt                                                       | -            | -            |\n| Trade payables                                                  | 148,218      | 192,328      |\n| Taxes and social payables                                       | 62,721       | 58,942       |\n| Other payables                                                  | 1,065,925    | 449,023      |\n| Total                                                           | 1,276,864    | 700,293      |\n\n7.",

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditors' report on the annual financial statements 7.10\n\nThis is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThis statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended 30 June 2022\n\nTo the Pernod Ricard S.A. Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Pernod Ricard for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as of 30 June 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements ' section of our report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\n## Valuation of investments\n\n(Notes 1.3 and 3 to the financial statements)\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, consolidated and non-consolidated investments are recorded in the balance sheet at a net carrying amount of \u20ac13,026 million and represent 83% of total assets. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf the value in use of investments is lower than their net carrying amount, a provision for impairment is recognised in financial income/(expense) in the amount of the difference. As disclosed in Note 1.3 to the financial statements, value in use is determined based on two methodologies:\n\n- The enterprise value of the main investments is based on the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> most recent estimate of the adjusted net asset value, by identifying unrealized capital gains on assets owned by the subsidiaries, such as brands. The adjusted net asset value is assessed based on methods such as the discounted cash flows method.\n- For other investments, value in use is estimated based on the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> share of the subsidiary's equity represented by the investment.\n\nEstimates of the value in use of these investments are based on complex valuation models for subsidiaries which in turn own several subsidiaries and require management to exercise significant judgment (particularly regarding cash flow assumptions and taking into consideration asset revaluations).\n\nGiven the weight of investments in the balance sheet, the complexity of the models used and their sensitivity to changes in the data and assumptions underlying estimates, we considered the determination of the value in use of investments to be a key audit\n\nmatter.\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the Company's controls covering the process for determining the value in use of investments. Our other procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- verifying, based on information communicated to us, that the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> values in use for investments estimated by management are supported by appropriate documentation of the valuation method and amounts used;\n- obtaining and analysing the valuation report on certain glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> investments produced by the Company's external valuation advisors;\n- comparing data used in investment impairment tests with glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> source documents by entity and the results of our audit procedures on these subsidiaries;\n- sample testing the arithmetical accuracy of values in use glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> adopted by the Company.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of disclosures in Note 1.3 to the financial statements.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from 1 July 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWithout qualifying our opinion mentioned above, we draw your attention to the change in accounting method related to the valuation of pensions and other long-term employee benefits described in note 1.8 \u00ab Pensions and other long-term employee benefits \u00bb in the notes to the financial statements, which presents the impact of the application of the IFRS IC decision on IAS 19 \u00ab Employee benefits \u00bb regarding the attribution of employee benefits to periods of service.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n7.",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Pernod Ricard S.A. by the Shareholders' Meeting of 13 May 2003 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and 17 November 2016 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs of 30 June 2021, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and KPMG S.A. were in the 19 th year and 6 th year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

or\n- make free allocations of shares to employees and/or (iii) Executive Directors of the Company and/or its current or future affiliates, under the terms and conditions of articles L. 225-197-1 and L. 22-10-59 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, it being specified that the shares may be allocated, in particular, to an employee savings plan in accordance with the provisions of article L. 3332-14 of the French Labour Code; or\n\n- retain them and subsequently tender them (in exchange, (iv) as payment or otherwise) within the scope of external growth transactions, subject to the limit of 5% of the number of shares comprising the share capital; or\n- deliver shares upon the exercise of rights attached to (v) securities granting access to the share capital through reimbursement, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or in any other manner; or\n- cancel all or some of the shares repurchased in this (vi) manner, under the conditions provided for in article L. 22-10-62 paragraph 4 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with the authorisation to reduce the share capital granted by the Combined General Meeting of 10 November 2021 in its 14 th resolution; or\n- allow an investment services provider to act on the (vii) secondary market or to ensure the liquidity of the Company's shares by means of liquidity agreements in compliance with the terms of a Code of Ethics approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).\n\nThis programme is also intended to enable the Company to trade in the Company's shares for any other authorised purpose or any purpose that might come to be authorised by law or regulations in force.\n\nThe number of Company's shares purchased may be such that:\n\n- the Company does not purchase more than 10% of the shares glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> comprising the Company's share capital at any time during the term of the share buyback programme; this percentage applies to the share capital adjusted in accordance with capital transactions carried out after this General Meeting; in accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, when shares are repurchased to favour the liquidity of the share under the conditions set out by the applicable regulations, the number of shares taken into account for calculating the 10% cap is equal to the number of shares purchased, less the number of shares sold during the authorisation period;

These means include, in particular, over-the-counter transactions, sales of blocks of shares, sale and repurchase agreements and the use of any financial derivatives, traded on a regulated market or over-the-counter, or setting up option strategies (purchases and sales of puts and calls and any combinations thereof in compliance with the applicable regulations). Transactions involving blocks of shares may account for the entire share buyback programme.\n\nThese transactions may be carried out during periods considered appropriate by the Board of Directors. However, during a public offering period, buybacks may only be carried out if they:\n\n- enable the Company to comply with its prior commitments glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> undertaken before the launch of the public offering; and\n- are undertaken in connection with the pursuit of a share glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> buyback programme that was already in progress; and\n- fall within the scope of the objectives referred to in items glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> (i) to (iii) above; and\n- cannot cause the offer to fail. glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT>\n\nThe General Meeting decides that the maximum purchase price per share shall be \u20ac320, excluding acquisition costs.",

The deduction is no longer mandatory when the legal reserve reaches an amount equal to one-tenth of the share capital. It once again becomes mandatory in the event that, for whatever reason, this reserve falls below one-tenth of the share capital.\n\nFor the first distributable profit (dividend) as determined in accordance with the law, an amount corresponding to 6% of the fully paid up share is deducted, subject to the possibility that the Board of Directors authorises shareholders who request to do so to pay up their shares in advance, it being specified that the payments cannot give rise to entitlement to the aforementioned initial dividend.\n\nThis initial dividend is not cumulative, i.e. if profits for the financial year are not sufficient to make this payment or are only sufficient to make the payment in part, the shareholders cannot claim this on profits generated in the following financial year.\n\nFrom the available surplus, the Ordinary General Meeting may decide to deduct all amounts it considers appropriate, either to be carried forward to the following financial year or to be transferred to extraordinary or special reserves, with or without special allocations.\n\nThe balance is distributed among shareholders as an additional dividend.\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting is authorised to distribute non-statutory reserves set up in previous years any amounts that it considers should be either:\n\n- distributed to the shareholders or allocated to total or partial glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> depreciation of the shares; or\n- accumulated or used for the repurchase and cancellation of glyph<c=2,font=/AAPCKA+ArialMT> shares.\n\nWholly depreciated shares are replaced by dividend right certificates granting the same rights as the existing shares, with the exception of entitlement to the initial statutory dividend and capital repayment.\n\nDividend payment terms and conditions are fixed by the Ordinary General Meeting or, failing that, by the Board of Directors within the maximum period set by law.\n\nIn deliberating on the financial statements for the financial year, the Ordinary General Meeting has the option to grant each shareholder the choice between a cash or stock dividend, for all or part of a dividend or interim dividend payment.\n\nDividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months following the year end. This period may be extended by court ruling. Dividends will be transferred to the French State after the statutory period, i.e. five years.\n\n## Changes in the share capital and the rights attached to shares 9.1.10\n\nAny changes in the share capital or the voting rights attached to the shares making up the share capital shall be governed by the standard legal provisions as the articles of association (1) do not contain any specific provisions in this respect.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors 9.1.11\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s, member of the Compagnie R\u00e9gionale des Commissaires aux Comptes de Versailles (Versailles regional auditors' association), represented by Mr Marc de Villarty, whose registered office is at TSA 20303, 92030 La D\u00e9fense Cedex, reappointed by the General Meeting of 19 November 2017 for a term of six financial years, which will end after the General Meeting to be convened in 2023 to approve the preceding year's financial statements.\n\nKPMG SA, member of the Compagnie R\u00e9gionale des Commissaires aux Comptes de Versailles (Versailles regional auditors' association), represented by Ms Caroline Bruno-Diaz and Mr \u00c9ric Ropert, whose registered office is at Tour Eqho, 2 avenue Gambetta, 92066 Paris La D\u00e9fense Cedex, and whose term of office as passed by the General Meeting of 17 November 2016 will end after the General Meeting to be convened in 2022 to approve the preceding year's financial statements.\n\nThe renewal of the term of office of KPMG SA is subject to the approval of the General Meeting of 10 November 2022.\n\n## Fees of Statutory Auditors and members of their networks\n\nThe fees of the Statutory Auditors and members of their networks for the 12-month financial year are set out in Note 6.8 Fees of the Statutory Auditors and members of their networks for the 12-month financial year in Section 6 'Annual consolidated financial statements' of this universal registration document.\n\n9.",
