STRONG FUTURE.\n\nDAVID RAE President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n\nOverall, 2022 was another very strong year for Dundee Precious Metals. We delivered solid results at our mining operations and advanced our organic growth portfolio, all while maintaining the high standards for safety and sustainability which are core to our culture and values.\n\nWe achieved our gold production guidance while managing industry cost pressures and maintained our position as one of the lowest-cost gold producers. We generated strong free cash flow, returned $44.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our sustainable quarterly dividend, and continued to invest in our future, progressing the feasibility study update for Loma Larga in Ecuador and advancing exploration activities which led to a high-grade discovery at the \u010coka Rakita prospect in Serbia. We also continued to deliver on our ESG priorities and seek further opportunities to achieve our strategic objective of generating a net positive impact from our operations.\n\n## REVIEW OF 2022 PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2022, we delivered strong operating performance, producing 273,109 ounces of gold and 31 million pounds of copper at an all-in sustaining cost of $885 per gold ounce. This translated into strong financial results, including free cash flow generation of $166 million and adjusted net earnings of $129 million. We ended the year in a very strong financial position, with $433 million of cash on our balance sheet, no debt and an undrawn $150 million revolving credit facility. Notably, we delivered these results while achieving an impressive health and safety record, including over 6 million hours without a lost time injury at our Bulgarian operations.\n\nDuring the year, we made significant steps towards building for our future. We continued to advance the feasibility study ('FS') update for the highquality Loma Larga project in Ecuador, announced an exciting high-grade discovery at \u010coka Rakita, completed optimized life of mine ('LOM') updates at both Chelopech and Ada Tepe, and released strong initial drill results from exploration at the Tierras Coloradas prospect in Ecuador.\n\n## CHELOPECH: HIGH/uniF6BAQUALITY, CORNERSTONE ASSET\n\nChelopech continued its track record of consistent performance, producing 179,135 ounces of gold and 31 million pounds of copper.\n\nWe continue to focus on extending the mine life through our in-mine and brownfield exploration programs. In March 2023, we announced our year end 2022 Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource update, along with a LOM update extending mine life to 2031. In 2022, brownfield exploration at Chelopech focused on an intensive drilling campaign to support the application for a Commercial Discovery at Sveta Petka, the exploration licence surrounding the Chelopech mine.\n\nCombined with our demonstrated track record of converting Mineral Resources into Mineral Reserves and our in-mine and growing brownfield exploration programs, there is strong potential to continue extending mine life at Chelopech.\n\nDuring the year, we made significant steps towards building for our future.",

Highlights of the updated LOM plan, which is the result of an accelerated grade control drilling program and a strategic mine planning study include:\n\n- \u00b7   A 22% increase to LOM recovered gold ounces, for an additional 66,000 ounces compared to the previous LOM plan\n- \u00b7   A 13% increase in gold grade, and\n- \u00b7   A 1% increase in recovery.\n\nThe new LOM plan has resulted in an improved threeyear outlook for gold production for the Company. Overall, the new mine plan for Ada Tepe is another example that highlights the strength of our technical and operations team, and their ability to maximize the long-term value of our assets.\n\n## TSUMEB: FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL STABILITY, EFFICIENCIES AND COST REDUCTION\n\nIn 2022, the Tsumeb smelter processed 174,122 tonnes of complex concentrate. This was slightly below our revised guidance for the year. However, as we look ahead to 2023, we have a maintenance strategy in place to address the challenges that we encountered, and are forecasting a consistent throughput rate over the next three years. We are also expecting cost per tonne to decline, reflecting our ongoing efforts to optimize efficiencies and reduce costs.\n\n## BUILDING A STRONG FUTURE\n\n## LOW/uniF6BACOST FUTURE GROWTH AND EXPLORATION POTENTIAL IN ECUADOR\n\nIn 2022, we continued to advance the Loma Larga project in Ecuador. During the year, we received technical approval for the Environment Impact Assessment and approval for the tailings facility, key permitting milestones. Drilling activities as well as the next steps in the environment permitting process are currently paused as we await the outcome of an appeals process related to the decision on the Constitutional Protective Action following a hearing held in mid-October, which will provide clarity on the required consultation process.\n\nWe are currently leveraging our significant operating expertise at Chelopech to explore additional optimization opportunities at Loma Larga, which will be included in the updated FS. We expect to complete the optimized FS in the second half of 2023.\n\nWe continue to see Loma Larga as a high-quality project with the potential to generate strong economic returns following the results of this ongoing optimization work. As we continue to advance the project, our approach to developing Loma Larga will benefit from our firm commitment to the highest standards for engagement with local communities and environmental stewardship, in addition to our development and operating experience to unlock the significant potential of the project.\n\nAt the Tierras Coloradas exploration project, which is located in the province of Loja, we completed approximately 2,700 metres of drilling in the fourth quarter of 2022, which confirmed the presence of well-mineralized vein systems, with over eight kilometres of strike length delineated. We are planning further work in 2023 to follow-up on these encouraging results.\n\nWe see Loma Larga as a high-qualty project with the potential to generate strong economic returns following the results of our ongoing optimization work.",

Drilling at \u010coka Rakita in the fourth quarter of 2022 defined a large, high-grade footprint that remains open in multiple directions, which we believe has further exploration upside potential. Significantly, preliminary metallurgical test work indicates that the mineralized material is amenable to gravity recovery and conventional flotation, producing a clean gold concentrate with strong recoveries.\n\nGiven the potential of \u010coka Rakita, our activities in Serbia will be focused on aggressively advancing exploration and we are therefore pausing further work on the Timok feasibility study. We are planning to follow-up on these exceptional drill results we reported in January with a further 40,000 metres of infill and extensional drilling, and are targeting an initial Mineral Resource at \u010coka Rakita by the end of 2023.\n\nWe are excited about this new development in a region where we have developed strong relationships within the local communities and with the government and where we have had a local and regional presence for many years.\n\n## TRACK RECORD OF DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION\n\nIn 2022, we generated $166 million of free cash flow and significantly strengthened our balance sheet, ending the year with $433 million of cash, a $40.8 million investment portfolio, no debt and an undrawn $150 million revolving credit facility.\n\nWe have also demonstrated a strong track record of deploying our capital in a disciplined manner that balances our desire to reinvest in growing and optimizing the business with our commitment to\n\nreturning capital to our shareholders. In addition to investing in our future growth and exploration prospects, we have continued to pay a quarterly dividend since 2020, and in 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million common shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bid.\n\nIn aggregate, we returned approximately 27% of our free cash flow back to our shareholders in 2022. In February 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program to purchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common shares.\n\n## INDUSTRY/uniF6BALEADING ESG\n\nWe are focused on generating value for all of our stakeholders through our strong ESG performance. ESG is fundamental to our culture and is integrated into all levels of our organization. We have long understood the strategic importance of maintaining our social license and have seen first-hand how excelling in this important area is a competitive advantage that can unlock additional value and lead to superior long-term returns.\n\nDuring 2022, we made progress on a number of social and environmental initiatives, including developing our long-term commitments related to climate change. We are always looking for ways to reduce the impact of our operations, and we are very proud of what we have achieved at Chelopech, which has one of the lowest greenhouse gas emission intensity rates among gold mines in the world. However, we also recognize the global importance of climate change and our responsibility to further mitigate its impacts. We therefore announced our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, including a commitment to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 37.5% by 2035 and to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050, and to develop a Scope 3 emissions target by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we returned 27% of our free cash flow back to our shareholders.\n\nWe also continued to deliver strong ESG performance, ranking in the 91st percentile among metals and mining companies in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.",

In 2022, DPM scored in the 91st percentile for ESG performance among companies in the metals and mining industry in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is recognized by investors as a high-quality ESG rating agency. This result led to our inclusion in the 2023 S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook, which features companies that scored in the top 15% of their industry. As well, we received an 'A' rating from MSCI ESG Research LLC, a leading independent ESG rating agency.\n\nWhile we are proud of being recognized for our strong performance, we are constantly seeking opportunities to improve and to achieve our strategic objective of generating a net positive impact from our operations.\n\n## ADDING VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION\n\nWe have established a strong track record of unlocking value through innovation, including achieving improvements in safety, lowering costs and reducing our environmental impact. We have achieved these successes by encouraging creative thinking and problem solving, and we are continuously looking for new ways to improve. We view our strength in innovation as a competitive advantage and a valuable skillset which supports our growth ambitions and helps us to unlock future opportunities.\n\n## UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DELIVER SUPERIOR VALUE\n\nLooking forward, our updated three-year outlook reflects a strong production and attractive all-in sustaining cost profile. Over the next three years, we expect to produce an average of 270,000 gold ounces and 32 million pounds of copper annually.\n\nWe believe that DPM represents a compelling value opportunity relative to our peers, given our proven strengths and excellent future prospects, including:\n\n- \u00b7   Strong, consistent production from our operations and an all-in sustaining cost that ranks us among the lowest in the gold industry;\n- \u00b7   A robust free cash flow profile;\n- \u00b7   Financial strength and flexibility;\n- \u00b7   A record of disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders;\n- \u00b7   Attractive development projects;\n- \u00b7   Proven exploration success, both in extending mine life at our operations and discovering new brownfield opportunities;\n- \u00b7   A strong technical team with a history of adding real value through innovation;\n- \u00b7   Our strong ESG performance and constructive relationships with our host communities and governments\n\nWe are confident that we have laid a strong foundation for an exciting future ahead. We are committed to building on our record of strong performance and our unique strengths in ESG and innovation to generate superior value for all of our stakeholders.\n\nI'd like to close by acknowledging the contributions of our dedicated employees across the company and our local stakeholders globally, all of whom contributed to our strong results.\n\nOn behalf of our entire team, thank you for your support.\n\nDAVID RAE President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to building on our record of strong performance and our unique strengths in ESG and innovation to generate superior value for all of our stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Operating Highlights\n\nIn 2022, the Company's mine operations, Chelopech and Ada Tepe, delivered robust gold production within or towards the higher end of their respective annual guidance ranges for the year, while copper production at Chelopech was 3% below the low end of the guidance range. Despite inflationary cost pressures in 2022, the Company achieved an all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold within the guidance range for the year.\n\n- x Gold contained in concentrate produced in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 73,420 ounces and 273,109 ounces, respectively, was 11% and 12% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to mining in lower grade zones at Ada Tepe, partially offset by higher gold recoveries at Chelopech, in line with the mine plans for both operations.\n- x Payable gold in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 65,831 ounces and 242,697 ounces, respectively, was 11% and 13% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 primarily reflecting lower gold production.\n- x Copper production in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 7.4 million pounds and 30.8 million pounds, respectively, was 19% and 11% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower copper grades.\n- x Payable copper in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 6.7 million pounds and 27.2 million pounds, respectively, was 18% and 17% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower copper production.\n- x All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $1,008 was 33% higher than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses reflecting the local inflationary environment, lower by-product credits as a result of lower volumes of copper sold, and lower volumes of gold sold, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2022 of $885 was 35% higher than 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold, lower by-product credits, higher freight charges and higher local currency operating expenses, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n- x Complex concentrate smelted during the fourth quarter of 2022 of 41,835 tonnes was 19% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to a 17-day shutdown to repair a water leak in the off-gas system and instability in the power grid as a result of abnormally heavy rainfall in December. Complex concentrate smelted during 2022 of 174,122 tonnes was 8% lower than 2021 due primarily to unplanned downtime as a result of maintenance to the off-gas and baghouse systems during the year, partially mitigated by near record-level quarterly production in the third quarter of 2022.\n- x Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $443 and $463, respectively, was comparable to the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily  to  higher  sulphuric  acid  by-product  credits  and  lower  labour  costs  related  to  the  cost optimization initiative undertaken in 2022, partially offset by lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted and higher inflationary local currency operating expenses.\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nFinancial results from operations in 2022 reflected lower volumes of metal sold, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\n- x Revenue during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $152.9 million and $569.8 million, respectively, were 8% and 11% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of gold and copper sold.\n- x Cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $91.1 million was 3% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher local currency mine operating expenses in Bulgaria. Cost of sales in 2022 of $357.4 million was comparable to 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar largely offset by higher local currency mine operating expenses in Bulgaria and higher depreciation.",

Net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations in 2022 were $35.9 million ($0.19 per share) compared to $190.7 million ($1.02 per share) in 2021, due primarily to an impairment charge of $85.0 million in respect of Tsumeb, as well as lower volumes of metal sold, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n- x Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $33.3 million ($0.18 per share) and $129.0 million ($0.68 per share), respectively, compared to $51.4 million ($0.27 per share) and $202.0 million ($1.09 per share) in the corresponding periods in 2021, due primarily to the same factors affecting net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations, with the exception of the adjusting items primarily related to the Tsumeb impairment charge.\n- x Earnings before income taxes in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $37.6 million and $58.7 million, respectively, compared to $60.3 million and $229.4 million in the corresponding periods in 2021. These changes reflect the same factors that affected net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations, except for income tax, which is excluded.\n- x Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 was $58.3 million and $252.9 million, respectively, compared to $84.3 million and $336.9 million in the corresponding periods in 2021, reflecting the same factors that affected adjusted net earnings, except for interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.\n- x Cash provided from operating activities in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $49.3 million and $232.1 million, respectively, was 45% and 8% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021, due primarily to the same factors impacting earnings before income taxes, excluding the non-cash impairment charge in respect of Tsumeb, as well as timing of deliveries and subsequent receipt of cash.\n- x Free cash flow in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $33.3 million and $166.4 million, respectively, was $32.5 million and $86.0 million lower than the corresponding periods in 2021, due primarily  to  the  same  factors  impacting  earnings  before  income  taxes,  excluding  the  non-cash impairment charge in respect of Tsumeb.\n- x Return of capital to shareholders through dividends declared of $30.5 million ($0.16 per share) and shares repurchased under the Normal Course Issuer Bid ('NCIB') of $13.6 million (Cdn$17.6 million) in 2022, which in aggregate represented 27% of free cash flow, reflecting strong ongoing performance and significant free cash flow generation. The Board of Directors has approved the renewal of the NCIB, pending TSX approval, for the purchase of up to $100 million of the Company's common shares over a period of twelve months commencing after the TSX approval, subject to certain internal parameters.\n- x Sustaining capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $16.7 million and $58.2 million, respectively, were comparable to the corresponding periods in 2021 of $12.3 million and $52.5 million.\n- x Growth capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $11.2 million and $32.4 million, respectively, compared to $7.4 million and $17.1 million in the corresponding periods in 2021, due primarily to activities related to the development of the Loma Larga and Timok gold projects.\n- x Strong balance sheet as at December 31, 2022 with $433.2 million in cash, an investment portfolio of $40.8 million, an undrawn $150.0 million RCF and no debt.\n\n## Growth, Exploration and Other Highlights\n\n- x Ada Tepe updated life of mine plan: Updated life of mine plan resulted in an estimated increase in recovered gold to concentrate of approximately 66,000 ounces, or an average of approximately 16,500 ounces of additional gold production per year for 2023 through 2026. The additional estimated production has been reflected in the Company's three-year outlook.\n- x Chelopech mine life extension: Completed an updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate for Chelopech in March 2022 that extended the mine life to 2030.",

        "page_content": "- x Loma Larga gold project: The timing for recommencing drilling activities and further advancing the environmental permitting process remain subject to an appeal process currently before the Provincial Court of Azuay. DPM has therefore taken the decision to extend the timeline for the optimization phase of the updated feasibility study ('FS') for Loma Larga, which is now expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. This will allow DPM to evaluate additional optimization opportunities that have been identified to leverage the Company's significant operating expertise with similar deposits, in particular Chelopech in Bulgaria. The impact of certain scope changes and inflationary cost pressures continue to be assessed as part of the updated FS.\n- x Timok gold project and \u00fd oka Rakita: The Company is pausing further work on the Timok FS to focus on further exploration and delineation of the new high-grade discovery at \u00fd oka Rakita in Serbia. Additional work is planned in 2023 to further assess \u00fd oka Rakita's Mineral Resource potential. DPM intends to release additional results from drilling in the second quarter of 2023 and is targeting an initial Mineral Resource estimate in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n- x Other exploration: An initial drill program at Tierras Coloradas tested a high-grade low sulphidation vein system, with further work planned for 2023. An advanced brownfield drill program at Chelopech was focused on supporting a Commercial Discovery application for the Sveta Petka licence.\n- x ESG: DPM scored in the 91st percentile among metals and mining companies in the 2022 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, and was included in The Sustainability Yearbook for the second consecutive year.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion on the operating results of Chelopech, Ada Tepe and Tsumeb, activities related to the growth projects and exploration, as well as the financial results, refer to the 'Review of Operating Results by Segment', 'Development and Other Major Projects', 'Exploration' and 'Review of Financial Results' sections of this MD&A.",

Total complex concentrate smelted for the year was 6% below the low end of the updated 2022 guidance range due primarily to additional unplanned maintenance as a result of water leaks in the off-gas system and instability in the power grid as a result of abnormally heavy rainfall in December.\n\nCash cost per tonne of concentrate smelted in 2022 was towards the higher end of the updated guidance range due primarily to the fixed cost nature of the facility and the impact of lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.",

        "page_content": "DPM continues to focus on increasing the profitability of its business by optimizing existing operating assets, which are expected to maintain high levels of gold production as highlighted in the 2023 to 2025 outlook and detailed 2023 guidance below.\n\n## 2023 to 2025 Outlook\n\nThe production outlook for 2023 to 2025 is based on historical performance and experience at DPM's operations and in the case of its mining operations is consistent with the production schedules outlined in the technical report for Chelopech entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report - Mineral Resource and Reserve Update, Chelopech Mine, Chelopech, Bulgaria' dated March 31, 2022 (the 'Chelopech Technical Report'), and the news release for Ada Tepe entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces Life of Mine Plan with Additional Production and Updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate for Ada Tepe' dated January 12, 2023, both of which have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are posted on the Company's website (www.dundeeprecious.com). A technical report for the Ada Tepe mine, prepared in accordance  with  NI  43-101  (the  'Ada  Tepe  Technical  Report'),  will  be  filed  within  45  days  of  the aforementioned news release. For 2024 and 2025, production and cost estimates do not fully incorporate operating  performance  improvements  in  respect  of  mine  and  smelter  throughput  and  potential improvements to mine grades and recoveries. The 2023 to 2025 outlook is forward looking and based on certain estimates and assumptions which involve risks and uncertainties and is predicated on the conflict in Ukraine and the coronavirus ('COVID-19') pandemic having no material impact on DPM's production and costs. Actual results may vary materially from management's expectations. See the 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements' and 'Risks and Uncertainties' sections later in this MD&A for further information.\n\nHighlights of the three-year outlook include:\n\n- x Maintained strong gold production levels : Over the next three years, gold production is expected to average approximately 270,000 ounces per year based on current mine plans.\n- x Stable copper production : Copper production over the next three years is expected to average approximately  32 million pounds per year, based on current mine plans, with higher forecasted production in 2023 and 2024 compared to the previous outlook.\n- x Improved all-in sustaining cost: All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold is expected to range between $700 and $860 in 2023 and between $720 and $880 for 2024 and 2025, which is lower than previously expected. This reflects the benefits of higher expected volumes of gold sold as a result of the updated life of mine plan at Ada Tepe and higher by-product credits reflecting higher copper prices, partially offset by a weaker U.S. dollar.\n- x Consistent smelter performance: The Company is forecasting complex concentrate smelted to be between 200,000 and 230,000 tonnes in each of the next three years, reflecting its expectation for a consistent rate of throughput following a plan to resolve water leak issues by April 2023. Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted is expected to trend lower over the next three-year period, reflecting the benefit of a consistent throughput level, as well as estimated cost savings associated with the ongoing comprehensive cost optimization initiative which commenced in 2022.\n- x Sustaining capital expenditures: Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to trend lower over the next three years, due primarily to the completion of the upgraded tailings management facility at Chelopech and the gradual reduction in activities at Ada Tepe as the mine approaches its end of life in 2026.",

The rate of capital expenditures is also expected to vary from quarter to quarter based on the schedule for, and execution of, each capital project.\n\nAdditional detail on the Company's three-year outlook is set out below:\n\n## Chelopech\n\nGold and copper contained in concentrate produced are expected to be consistent with production schedules and expected grades outlined in the most recently issued technical report. Gold contained in concentrate produced remains unchanged from the previous outlook for 2023 and 2024, with the outlook for 2025 relatively consistent with 2024 production levels. The outlook for copper contained in concentrate produced in 2023 and 2024 has been revised from the previous outlook of between 32 and 39 million pounds for 2023 and between 30 and 35 million pounds for 2024.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed is expected to be higher in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily reflecting a stronger Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and the local inflationary environment.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be in line with 2022 results, reflecting additional costs related to the upgrade of Chelopech's tailings management facility which is expected to be completed in 2023. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to trend lower in 2024 and decline even further in 2025. Growth capital expenditures related to resource development drilling and margin improvement projects are expected to be between $2 million and $3 million in 2023, relatively consistent year over year.\n\n## Ada Tepe\n\nGold contained in concentrate produced in 2023 and 2024 is expected to be higher than the previously issued outlook range of 115,000 to 140,000 ounces in 2023, and 69,000 to 83,000 ounces in 2024, reflecting the updated life of mine plan announced in January 2023, which included an increase of approximately 66,000 ounces of total gold recovered to concentrate for 2023 through 2026.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed is expected to be higher in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily reflecting lower volumes of ore processed, higher royalty payments due to higher contained ounces mined, a stronger Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and the local inflationary environment.",

        "page_content": "Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be higher than the previous outlook range of between $9 million and $10 million in each of 2023 and 2024, as a result of increased costs related to Ada Tepe's integrated waste management facility, before reducing to a range of $8 million to $10 million in 2025.\n\n## Tsumeb\n\nComplex concentrate smelted is expected to stabilize at the range of 200,000 and 230,000 tonnes annually for the next three years, following a plan to resolve water leak issues to the off-gas system by April 2023. Over 90% of concentrate feed is currently contracted through to the end of 2023, with the remaining feed in 2023 and additional feed thereafter expected to be contracted in the normal course.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures are expected to be between $14 million and $17 million for each of 2023 and 2025, and between $10 million and $13 million in 2024, reflecting the timing of scheduled maintenance shutdowns based on an expected 18-month operating cycle for the Ausmelt furnace.\n\n## Loma Larga gold project\n\nGrowth capital expenditures for 2023 associated with the Loma Larga gold project are expected to be between $10 million and $14 million, covering the estimated running costs for the year, which mainly include general and administrative expenses, and costs related to certain permitting, social and environmental related activities.\n\nUpon achieving certain milestones for the project, the Company will increase its guidance for growth capital expenditures, reflecting additional funding to resume drilling and further advance permitting. The amount and timing of the spend in respect of this additional funding is dependant on the timing of achieving the respective milestones in the year.\n\nSee the 'Development and Other Major Projects - Loma Larga Gold Project' section contained in this MD&A for further details.\n\n## Timok gold project\n\nThe Company is pausing work on the Timok FS to focus on further exploration at \u00fd oka Rakita and as a result, growth capital expenditures are expected to be significantly reduced in 2023 to a range of $1 million to $2 million.\n\nSee the 'Development and Other Major Projects - Timok Gold Project' section contained in this MD&A for further details.\n\n## Exploration expenses\n\nExpenditures related to exploration in 2023 are expected to be between $25 million and $30 million due primarily to higher expected drilling activities following the positive discovery of a high-grade deposit at \u00fd oka Rakita in Serbia, and an advanced brownfield drill program at Chelopech focusing on the Sveta Petka Commercial Discovery application process as well as additional drilling at Sharlo Dere.\n\nSee the 'Exploration' section contained in this MD&A for further details.",

29,968 ounces due primarily to lower gold grades. Gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced decreased by 3% to 15,371 ounces due primarily to lower gold grades, partially offset by higher gold recoveries. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Chelopech produced low copper concentrate grade gold-copper concentrate for deliveries to third party smelters, which resulted in higher volumes of concentrate produced and improved copper and combined gold recoveries during the quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, when all Chelopech gold-copper concentrates were delivered to Tsumeb.\n\nRelative to 2021, gold contained in gold-copper concentrate produced in 2022 increased by 3% to 120,053 ounces due primarily to higher gold recoveries from process efficiency improvement initiatives targeting improved recoveries. Gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced in 2022 of 59,082 ounces was comparable to 2021.\n\nCopper production during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 7.4 million pounds and 30.8 million pounds was 19% and 11% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower copper grades, in line with the mine plan.",

        "page_content": "In the fourth quarter of 2022, payable gold in gold-copper concentrate sold decreased slightly to 28,795 ounces due primarily to lower gold production, partially offset by the timing of shipments. Payable copper in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 18% to 6.7 million pounds, consistent with lower copper production, relative to the corresponding period in 2021. Payable gold in pyrite concentrate sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 of 10,408 ounces was 8% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to the timing of shipments.\n\nIn 2022, payable gold in gold-copper concentrate sold of 110,752 ounces was comparable to 2021. Payable copper in 2022 decreased by 17% to 27.2 million pounds, consistent with lower copper production relative to 2021. Payable gold in pyrite concentrate sold in 2022 of 40,828 ounces was 8% higher than 2021 due primarily to higher payable gold percentage terms that were generally offset by higher treatment charges and other deductions.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGold-copper concentrate inventory totalled 1,841 tonnes as at December 31, 2022, down from 2,856 tonnes as at December 31, 2021. Pyrite concentrate inventory totalled 14,241 tonnes as at December 31, 2022, up from 13,301 tonnes as at December 31, 2021. These changes in inventory were due primarily to the timing of deliveries.\n\n## Cash cost measures\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $51 was 6% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by inflationary pressures on local currency operating expenses and lower volumes of ore processed. Cash cost per tonne of ore processed in 2022 of $50 was 6% higher than 2021 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses and lower volumes of ore processed, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nCash cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $862 was 36% higher than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses, lower by-product credits as a result of lower volumes of copper sold and higher freight charges, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar and lower treatment charges. Cash cost per ounce of gold sold in 2022 of $712 was 31% higher than 2021 due primarily to lower by-product credits, higher freight charges and higher local currency operating expenses, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1,253 compared to $833 in the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses, lower byproduct credits, higher cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures and higher freight charges, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar and lower treatment charges. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2022 was $957 compared to $722 in 2021 due primarily to lower by-product credits, higher freight charges,  higher  local  currency  operating  expenses  and  higher  cash  outlays  for  sustaining  capital expenditures, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $11.1 million and $26.9 million, respectively, were $6.1 million and $4.3 million higher than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to the timing of expenditures.\n\n## Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource update\n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company announced a mine life extension to 2030, an optimized life of mine plan and updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates for the Chelopech mine. The updated Mineral Reserve Estimates for Chelopech, effective as of December 31, 2021, consists of 5.8 million tonnes Proven Mineral Reserves grading 2.72 g/t of gold, 0.85% copper and 6.8 g/t of silver, for 0.51 million ounces of gold, 108.9 million pounds of copper and 1.27 million ounces of silver. Probable Mineral Reserves were 13.6 million tonnes grading 2.72 g/t of gold, 0.78% copper and 7.9 g/t of silver, for 1.19 million ounces of",

Gold grades increased as planned and the operation is well positioned for higher grades in 2023, as per the mine plan.\n\n## Gold sold\n\nPayable gold in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of 26,628 ounces and 91,117 ounces, respectively, was 20% and 30% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021, consistent with lower production.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGold concentrate inventory totalled 97 tonnes as at December 31, 2022, up from 29 tonnes as at December 31, 2021, due primarily to the timing of deliveries.\n\n## Cash cost measures\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $58  was 3% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower volumes of gold sold and higher royalties. Cash cost per tonne of ore processed in 2022 of $55 was 6% higher than 2021 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses, partially offset by lower royalties and a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nCash cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $464 and $537, respectively, was 9% and 43% higher than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold and higher local currency operating expenses, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $648 compared to $665 in the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to lower cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures and a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower volumes of gold sold. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold in 2022 was $765 compared to $583 in 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold and higher local currency operating expenses, partially offset by lower cash outlays for sustaining capital.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $2.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, were 58% and 47% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to the completion of the accelerated grade control drilling program and the timing of expenditures on other projects.\n\n## Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource update\n\nOn January 12, 2023, the Company announced an updated life of mine plan and Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimate for the Ada Tepe mine. The updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate for Ada Tepe, effective December 31, 2022, reflects the results of 290 kilometres of grade control drilling completed since the previous 2020 update. Effectively all of the Mineral Resource estimate has now been converted to the Measured category. The updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve comprises of 2.49 Mt with an average grade of 5.19 g/t of gold and 3.13 g/t of silver for 415,000 contained gold ounces and 250,000 contained silver ounces.\n\nBased on the final pit design, a strategic mine planning study was conducted to optimize net present value of mine cash flows, balanced against other considerations including mine production, process plant throughput rates, stockpiling capacity, and mine life. The updated life of mine plan maintains production through 2026 and reflects an increase of approximately 66,000 ounces of total gold recovered with a higher life of mine gold grade of 5.19 g/t, relative to the same period in the previous 2020 life of mine plan.\n\nSee the Company's press release entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces Life of Mine Plan with Additional Production and Updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate for Ada Tepe' dated January 12, 2023, which has been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and is posted on the Company's",

        "page_content": "## Loma Larga Gold Project\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, DPM completed the acquisition of the high-quality, advanced stage Loma Larga gold project in the Azuay province of Ecuador. Loma Larga is expected to produce a pyrite gold concentrate that can be sold to various copper and gold smelting operations, as well as a small quantity of complex concentrate, which DPM could process at its Tsumeb smelter or sell on the market.\n\nA FS completed by the previous owner in April 2020, which is currently being updated by DPM, outlined a 12-year life of mine plan with estimated annual mine production of approximately 200,000 gold ounces in concentrate in the first five years. Life of mine production is estimated to be approximately 170,000 gold ounces per year.\n\nFor more information, including key assumptions, risks and parameters relating to the FS, refer to the Technical Report entitled 'NI 43-101 Feasibility Study Technical Report, Loma Larga Project, Azuay Province, Ecuador' dated April 8, 2020 and re-issued by DPM on November 29, 2021, which has been posted  on  the  Company's  website  at  www.dundeeprecious.com  and  has  been  filed  on  SEDAR  at www.sedar.com.\n\nA  15,800  metre  drilling  program  to  support  various  studies  complementary  to  the  Loma  Larga  FS optimization,  consisting  of  hydrogeological,  geotechnical,  metallurgical,  condemnation  and  extension drilling, commenced in the first quarter of 2022. A total of 658 metres of condemnation drilling was completed prior to DPM temporarily pausing drilling activities at the end of February as a result of the Constitutional Protection Action (the 'Action') filed in February 2022 against the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition ('MAATE'), and the suspension of the environmental permit required for exploration and technical drilling by the court.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the written decision on the Action by the Judicial Labour Unit of Cuenca upheld the validity of the environmental permits for exploration, confirmed that the MAATE did not violate rights relating to the protection of water and nature in granting the permits, and reaffirmed the Company's legal rights in the mining concessions. The court also found that the Company will be required to include the local indigenous populations in its consultation process prior to proceeding to the exploitation phase, which DPM had already planned as part of its development of the project, reflecting the Company's commitment to the highest standards of stakeholder engagement and in line with International Finance Corporation practices. The decision of the first instance court was appealed by all parties, including (i) by the Company and the government parties on the requirement for indigenous consultation and whether, if required, it must precede the remaining requirements for the environmental licence, including the Citizen Participation Process, and (ii) by the plaintiffs on the finding by the first instance court that the grant of permits did not violate the rights of nature and the other alleged violations. The appeal was heard by the Provincial Court of Azuay on October 14, 2022 and a decision is pending. The Company continues to believe that the claims made by the plaintiffs are without merit, however, drilling activities at Loma Larga remain paused pending that decision.\n\nFor further details on the Action, please see press release entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Provides Update on Drilling Activities at Loma Larga' issued on February 24, 2022, which has been posted on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and has been filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n\nIn parallel, the Company has continued to progress permitting activities, and received the certificate of technical viability for the filtered tailings storage facility at the end of June 2022, a key milestone for the project's development. As previously reported, in April 2022, the Company received the technical approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment ('EIA') study, which was submitted to MAATE by the previous owner prior to its acquisition by DPM. The MAATE has appointed facilitators to carry out the Citizen Participation Process, which remains paused pending the resolution of the Action. Once these activities resume, DPM and its EIA consultant will support the Citizen Participation Process, assess all comments received and make the necessary updates to the EIA in order to assist the MAATE in providing its final approval  of  the  EIA  and  issuing  the  environmental  licence.  The  expected  timing  for  receipt  of  the environmental licence is subject to the outcome of the appeal process.",

This will allow DPM time to evaluate additional optimization opportunities that have been identified to leverage the Company's significant operating expertise with similar deposits, in particular Chelopech in Bulgaria, which shares similar geology, mining method and processing flow sheet to the Loma Larga project; and to potentially incorporate the results of the drilling program supporting the updated FS optimization once DPM is able to recommence those activities.\n\nPrior to the acquisition, DPM had determined that the initial capital estimate for the project, prepared by the previous owner in April 2020, was low. Since then, the Company has incorporated certain scope changes to the project as part of the updated FS work, to enhance project execution and meet DPM's operating standards. DPM has also seen inflationary pressures consistent with general industry trends. Combined, these factors are expected to result in a significant increase to the estimated initial capital and operating costs for the project. This may impact the economics and other parameters, including Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, which are being assessed as the additional work required for the updated FS progresses.  DPM views Loma Larga as a high-quality advanced stage project with the potential to generate strong economic returns following the results of the ongoing optimization work.\n\nThe Company has progressed discussions with the government of Ecuador in respect of an investor protection agreement, which is targeted to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In-line with its disciplined approach to project development, the Company does not anticipate making any significant capital commitments for the project prior to the completion of the investment protection agreement and receipt of the environmental licence.\n\nDPM maintains a constructive relationship with government institutions and other stakeholders involved with the development of the project. After the announcement of the local election results, the DPM team welcomed the newly elected leaders and plans to engage with them in a proactive manner to build support for the project.\n\n## Timok Gold Project\n\nThe Timok gold project is a sediment hosted gold deposit located in the central-eastern region of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nIn February 2021, the Company announced the results of a pre-feasibility study and commenced a FS. As announced in January 2023, given the potential of the new high-grade discovery at the \u00fd oka Rakita prospect, the Company will now focus on further exploration at \u00fd oka Rakita in 2023 and, as a result, will pause further work on the Timok FS.\n\nAs previously reported, the Timok gold project has a Probable Mineral Reserve estimate of 662,000 ounces of gold contained within 19.2 million tonnes at a grade of 1.07 g/t and an additional Indicated Mineral Resource estimate of 1.3 million ounces of gold contained within 32.3 million tonnes at a grade of 1.27 g/t. The above Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource do not incorporate any drilling at \u00fd oka Rakita, which will be assessed as a separate high-grade deposit.\n\nThe three-year retention of mineral rights for the Timok gold project was received during the third quarter of 2021. Other permitting activities for the project continued during the fourth quarter of 2022, including the certification of reserves and spatial planning, with the objective of securing the mining rights for the project during the retention period. The Company plans to pause the submission of the application for the certificate of reserves and any activities associated with the spatial planning public hearings.\n\nFor additional details, including key assumptions, risks and parameters relating to the pre-feasibility study, refer to the news release entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces Positive Pre-Feasibility Study and Encouraging New Exploration Results for the Timok Gold Project in Serbia' dated February 23, 2021 and the Technical Report entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report, Timok Project, Pre-Feasibility Study, \u017dagubica, Serbia'  effective  March  30,  2021,  which  have  been  posted  on  the  Company's  website  at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.",

        "page_content": "## Tsumeb Rotary Holding Furnace\n\nAs part of the Company's strategy to optimize the inherent value of the Tsumeb smelter operation, an assessment was completed in respect of the installation of a rotary holding furnace which has the potential to increase the smelter's throughput up to approximately 370,000 tonnes, increase metal recoveries and generate significant additional value, given the high fixed-cost nature of the smelter. The estimated upfront capital cost was estimated to be between $47 million and $55 million. To date, the Company has been unable to secure additional long-term supply of suitable complex concentrate on acceptable terms that would support the expansion. While the Company will continue to assess opportunities that could support this expansion, the current focus of the smelter is on optimizing its operating performance and cost structure to support economically processing increasing amounts of new third party feed to replace Chelopech concentrate, which by 2024 is expected to be processed entirely at third party smelters.\n\n## EXPLORATION\n\n## Chelopech Mine\n\nIn 2022, the Company continued to advance in-mine exploration activities aimed at resource development, drilling a total of approximately 45,000 metres, of which approximately 34,000 metres were extensional drilling designed to explore for new mineralization along interpreted geological trends and to test potential exploration targets.\n\nDuring 2022, extensional diamond drilling in the Chelopech mine was concentrated on testing several potential targets:\n\n- x Structurally controlled zones of pyrite rich, high-sulphidation mineralization located on the northern flank of Chelopech. A total of approximately 11,700 metres were drilled in 2022.\n- x Quartz-Barite-Gold-Sulphide ('QBGS') zone located in the southeastern section of the mine. This zone is characterized by relatively narrow, structurally controlled QBGS mineralization, hosted within a halo of pervasive sericitic alteration. During 2022, a total of approximately 4,800 metres of underground drilling was undertaken toward this target.\n- x The infilling of the existing drilling grid to test potential areas above existing ore bodies mainly in the northwestern part of the mine.\n- x The evaluation of the deeper potential of the hydrothermal system as well as to collect samples for metallurgical purposes.\n\nThe 2023 Mineral Resource development strategy for Chelopech will be focused on the following:\n\n- x Extensional drilling to continue testing the conceptual targets in the northeastern part of the deposit.\n- x Testing structurally controlled zones of pyrite rich, high-sulphidation mineralization located on the northern flank of Chelopech.\n- x Drilling the upper levels of the Western part of the deposit in the gap between Blocks 103, 150 and 153.\n\nThe Company has budgeted between $5 million and $6 million on exploration activities at the Chelopech mine in 2023.\n\n## Chelopech Brownfield Exploration\n\nDuring 2022, a total of approximately 67,500 metres of surface exploration diamond drilling was completed, which comprised of ninety-two completed and six ongoing holes with up to ten operating drill rigs. The brownfield exploration program at Chelopech was focused on an intensive drilling campaign to support a Commercial Discovery application for the Sveta Petka exploration licence, which is now close to completion.\n\n## Sveta Petka EL.\n\nAn intensive delineation and infill drilling campaign was completed on the Sveta Petka exploration licence, focused  on  Wedge,  West  Shaft,  Krasta  and  Petrovden  prospects.  The  final  Geology  Report  and Commercial Discovery Application is scheduled for submission to the Bulgarian authorities during the first quarter of 2023. After Sveta Petka is registered as a Commercial Discovery, which is expected by the end of 2023, the Company intends to apply for concession rights in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Sharlo Dere\n\nThe  prospect  is  located  at  the  north-eastern  flank  of  the  Chelopech  mine  concession.  A  total  of approximately 16,400 metres of surface exploration drilling at an approximately 100 metre grid spacing was conducted, which confirmed Bulgarian state drilling results from the late 1970s and locally extended mineralization. Results demonstrated reasonable levels of continuity and reinforced the validity of the exhalative style high-sulphidation mineralization model. Geological modelling and early-stage resource reevaluation are underway.\n\nExploration  drilling  will  continue  in  2023  with  approximately  50,000  metres  planned,  aiming  to  test conceptual targets on the Brevene exploration licence as well as in the Chelopech mine concession which includes follow-up on the Sharlo Dere prospect and other targets, including testing for deeper extensions of the Chelopech deposit.\n\nThe Company has budgeted a total of $5 million to $6 million for Chelopech brownfield exploration activities in 2023.\n\n## Ada Tepe Brownfield Exploration\n\nIn 2022, exploration activities focused on a Mineral Resource extension drilling program at Ada Tepe and other satellites in the Khan Krum mine concession area, as well as target delineation campaigns on the Chiirite and Dalbokata Reka exploration licences. Approximately 9,400 metres were drilled over 47 holes during the year.\n\n## Khan Krum Concession Area\n\nA dedicated drilling program to test for potential extensions of mineralization to the north and to test for conceptual feeder structures at depth was implemented with 17 holes consisting of approximately 2,700 metres. Results of extensional drilling to the north of the deposit returned a series of narrow intervals of mineralization above the mine cut-off, which may represent incremental extensions of Upper Zone vein swarms. The Company is assessing if follow-up infill RC drilling is required in this area.\n\n## Chiirite Exploration Licence\n\nOn the Chiirite exploration licence, the drilling program at the Golden Creek and Chernichino prospects was completed in 2022 with a total of approximately 3,400 metres drilled during the year from 11 drill holes. The program generated encouraging results from drill hole ZDDD004 on Chernichino target, which returned 10 metres at 1.98 g/t of gold and 1.21 g/t of silver. This intercept will be followed up in 2023 and pending permitting, drilling will also focus on the area to the south at Kara Tepe, where a prospective structurally controlled granite hosted target and a separate skarn/carbonate replacement gold target was delineated in 2022 by combined IP pole-dipole electrical survey, ground radiometry survey and mapping.\n\nIn 2023, DPM will be employing a focused approach to evaluate undercover targets within the Krumovgrad camp. Targeting methodologies will be driven by integration and re-interpretation of existing data, which will  be  assisted  by  machine  learning,  additional  geophysical  methods  and  spectral  satellite  image processing, followed by approximately 11,000 metres of drilling. Drilling is initially planned to focus on the Chiirite licence area, while the Company finalizes permitting for the Krumovitsa licence, which is expected in the third quarter of 2023. Subject to the timing of permits, there is potential to increase drilling activities to approximately 26,000 metres.\n\nThe Company has budgeted a total of $2 million to $3 million for Ada Tepe brownfield exploration activities in 2023.\n\n## Serbia Exploration\n\nIn Serbia, exploration activities during 2022 have been focused on target delineation work and limited scout drilling at Umka, Zdrelo and other early-stage exploration licences. At the \u00fd oka Rakita prospect, drilling resumed in the fourth quarter of 2022 following receipt of a newly granted exploration licence with approximately 8,700 metres completed by the end of 2022. Drilling defined a large high-grade footprint that",

Results to date are very encouraging, and the Company plans to follow up on these results with approximately 40,000 metres of infill, extensional and target delineation drilling that is planned at \u00fd oka Rakita in 2023. The primary focus of drilling is to further assess the overall deposit geometry, grade continuity and Mineral Resource potential. DPM intends to release additional results from drilling in the second quarter and is targeting an initial Mineral Resource estimate for \u00fd oka Rakita in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, approximately 10,000 metres of drilling is planned at the adjacent Umka exploration licence, which is located to the south of \u00fd oka Rakita and shares a similar geological environment. This work is intended to follow up on ground gravity surveys completed in 2022 and will involve integration of all other available data to delineate additional undercover high-grade skarn targets.\n\nThe Company has budgeted a total of $12 million to $13 million for Serbian exploration activities in 2023, mainly focused on the \u00fd oka Rakita prospect.\n\nFor further details on the drilling program at \u00fd oka Rakita, please see press release entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces Discovery of Significant High-Grade Deposit at \u00fd oka Rakita; Results Include Drill Intercept of 40 metres at 63.6 g/t Au and 0.11% Cu', issued on January 16, 2023, which has been posted  on  the  Company's  website  at  www.dundeeprecious.com  and  has  been  filed  on  SEDAR  at www.sedar.com.\n\n## Ecuador Exploration\n\n## Loma Larga Concessions\n\nOn the Loma Larga concessions, a drilling program of approximately 15,800 metres to support various studies complementary to the Loma Larga FS optimization, consisting of hydrogeological, geotechnical, metallurgical, condemnation and extension drilling, was commenced in the first quarter of 2022. A total of approximately 650 metres of condemnation drilling was completed prior to DPM temporarily pausing drilling activities at the end of February 2022 as a result of the Action filed against the MAATE by certain nongovernment organizations and local agencies. Drilling activities remain paused, pending the resolution of the court process (see the 'Development and Other Major Projects - Loma Larga Gold Project' section contained in this MD&A for further details).\n\nIn 2023, the drilling program is expected to be restarted, pending the outcome of the appeals process.\n\n## Tierras Coloradas Concessions\n\nIn 2022, the Company completed a diamond drilling program of approximately 2,700 metres and assay results are being reviewed. The drill program tested the low sulphidation epithermal vein system which was previously identified in 2020. The change in status of the Tierras Coloradas project from early to advanced stage exploration is in progress, and all regulatory authorizations required from the different Ecuadorian authorities are expected to be received by early 2024.\n\nDuring the transition period of the phase change, a drill program will be proposed to test the best targets identified from work completed in 2022. Additional drilling is planned to delineate the shape, size, and extents  of  the  main  veins  system.  Furthermore,  additional  untested  portions  of  the  veins  and  soilgeochemistry anomalies will be subject to follow-up drilling. Detailed surface mapping in conjunction with soil and rock chip-channel sampling will continue, in order to determine the surface footprint and identify additional targets.\n\nThe Company has budgeted between $1 million and $2 million for exploration activities at Tierras Coloradas in 2023.",

Revenue during 2022 of $271.7 million was 7% lower than 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of copper sold and higher freight charges, partially offset by higher realized copper prices and lower treatment charges.\n\nAt Ada Tepe, revenue during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $46.6 million and $161.8 million, respectively, was 22% and 29% lower than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to lower volumes of gold sold.\n\nAt Tsumeb, revenue during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $39.9 million and $136.3 million, respectively, was 19% and 14% higher than the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to higher estimated metal recoveries and higher sulphuric acid prices and toll rates, partially offset by lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted.",

        "page_content": "## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $91.1 million was 3% lower than the corresponding period in 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher local currency mine operating expenses in Bulgaria. Cost of sales in 2022 of $357.4 million was comparable to 2021 due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar largely offset by higher local currency mine operating expenses in Bulgaria and higher depreciation.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $10.5 million and $28.8 million, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $18.2 million in the corresponding periods in 2021, due primarily to variations in the Company's share-based compensation expense as a result of changes in DPM's share price, higher costs related to corporate digital and innovation initiatives and higher employee costs.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation expenses\n\nExploration and evaluation expenses in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $8.4 million and $24.2 million, respectively, compared to $4.4 million and $18.0 million in the corresponding periods in 2021 due primarily to higher drilling volumes at Chelopech related to the Sveta Petka Commercial Discovery process, as well as additional drilling at Sharlo Dere.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion on the Company's exploration activities, refer to the 'Exploration' section of this MD&A.\n\n## Tsumeb Impairment charge\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the carrying value of Tsumeb exceeded its estimated recoverable amount resulting in an impairment charge of $85.0 million being recognized in the audited consolidated statements of earnings (loss), of which $84.3 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $0.7 million related to intangible assets. This charge was primarily attributable to lower forecast toll revenue as a result of an expected reduction in higher arsenic bearing third party concentrate feed being received by the smelter, commencing in 2024, concurrent with when the smelter is not expected to be processing any Chelopech concentrate. While the processing of Chelopech concentrate at other third party smelters is expected to generate additional overall value for the Company, it will be realized through lower treatment charges and higher margins at Chelopech rather than higher tolling rates and higher margins at Tsumeb.\n\n## Finance costs\n\nFinance costs are comprised of interest and other deemed financing costs in respect of the Company's debt facilities, lease obligations and rehabilitation provisions.\n\nFinance costs in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 were $1.5  million and $6.3  million, respectively, compared to $1.4 million and $5.5 million in the corresponding periods in 2021.",

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the Company's overall earnings, mix of foreign earnings or losses, which are subject to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits relating to corporate operating, exploration and evaluation costs, as well as unrealized gains or losses on the Company's publicly traded securities recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company's effective tax rate was also impacted by unrecognized tax benefits in respect of the Tsumeb impairment charge.\n\n| $ thousands, unless otherwise indicated                              | Three Months   | Three Months   | Twelve Months   | Twelve Months   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Ended December 31,                                                   | 2022           | 2021           | 2022            | 2021            |\n| Earnings before income taxes                                         | 37,632         | 60,274         | 58,742          | 229,418         |\n| Combined Canadian federal and provincial statutory income tax  rates | 26.5%          | 26.5%          | 26.5%           | 26.5%           |\n| Expected income tax expense                                          | 9,973          | 15,973         | 15,567          | 60,796          |\n| Lower rates on foreign earnings                                      | (985)          | (10,332)       | (26,593)        | (41,163)        |\n| Changes in unrecognized tax benefits                                 | (2,914)        | 2,477          | 30,867          | 14,842          |\n| Non-taxable portion of capital (gains) losses                        | (2,458)        | 583            | 2,223           | 3,346           |\n| Non-deductible share-based compensation expense                      | 74             | 74             | 296             | 279             |\n| Other, net                                                           | 622            | (606)          | 459             | 589             |\n| Income tax expense                                                   | 4,312          | 8,169          | 22,819          | 38,689          |\n| Effective income tax rates                                           | 11.5%          | 13.6%          | 38.8%           | 16.9%           |\n\nIn December 2020, the Namibian Ministry of Finance announced that tax incentives under the Export Processing Zones ('EPZ') Act would no longer be granted, effective December 31, 2020, and that companies with EPZ status, such as Tsumeb, would continue to benefit from these incentives up to December 31, 2025. The Ministry also announced that the EPZ regime will be replaced by a new regime known as the Sustainable Special Economic Zone ('SSEZ'). On January 18, 2023, the Ministry of Trade and Industrialisation stated that they have completed the draft bill on SSEZ, which has been submitted to Namibian Cabinet for approval. Thereafter the bill will be circulated to stakeholders for inputs before it is presented to Parliament for enactment.\n\n## Net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations\n\nNet earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $33.3 million ($0.18 per share) compared to $52.1 million ($0.27 per share) in the corresponding period in 2021. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of metal sold and lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nNet earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations in 2022 were $35.9 million ($0.19 per share) compared to $190.7 million ($1.02 per share) in 2021. This decrease was due primarily to the $85.0 million Tsumeb impairment charge, lower volumes of metal sold, higher local currency mine",

The average realized copper price for the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2022 of $3.65 per pound and $3.98 per pound, respectively, was 3% lower and 4% higher than the corresponding periods in 2021. These changes in realized copper prices deviated from the year over year changes in market prices as a result of DPM hedging substantially all of payable copper sold during 2021 at an average price of $3.72 per pound.\n\nThe price of gold is subject to volatile price movements over short periods of time and is affected by numerous industry and macro-economic factors that are beyond our control including, but not limited to, the supply of and demand for gold, interest rates (and interest rates expectations), inflation rates (and inflation expectations), currency movements and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, economic data and market volatility, as well as central bank reserves and investor behaviors. These diverse sources of impacts can counterbalance one another and provide gold with its uniquely stable performance at times, with gold's resilience  in  2022  as  a  good  example.  The  average  gold  price  in  2022  was  comparable  to  2021, representing a stable and uncorrelated performance of gold amid market turbulence, a strong U.S. dollar and an unprecedented rise in inflation and interest rates in the year.\n\nOverall, our view is that the demand for gold, the amount of gold in the central bank reserves, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the desire to hold gold as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, all help drive the price of gold in the near-term.\n\nThe price of copper is largely influenced by the health of the global economy. This is due to its widespread applications in all sectors of the economy, such as power generation and transmission, construction, transportation, factory equipment and electronics. Following strong copper prices in 2021 due to anticipated higher demand from increased manufacturing activity and a rebound in economic growth, low levels of global copper stockpiles and constrained mine supply, copper prices continued to rise and reached an alltime high in the first quarter of 2022 due to a widening supply and demand gap.\n\nIn the long run, the supply and demand fundamentals are supportive for copper prices, with the expectation of China's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising demand for copper in the green energy transition.\n\nThe Company regularly enters into cash settled commodity swap contracts to swap future contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices in order to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of its gold and copper concentrate sales ('QP Hedges'). In addition, the Company periodically enters into cash settled commodity swap and option contracts to reduce its price exposure on future sales associated with projected payable copper production ('Production Hedges') given the higher volatility in copper prices. The Company sells and hedges gold and copper metal contained in concentrates produced at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on major commodity exchanges, including the LME and the LBMA. The Company currently has no hedges in place for its expected payable copper to be sold in 2023.",

The weakness seen in late 2022 could continue into early 2023 largely driven by the expectations of the end of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rates hiking cycle and the potential peak or near-peak of global inflation, as well as the growing fear of a global recession. However, the higher yields available in the United States combined with a stronger growth outlook than most other markets may support a steady U.S. dollar in 2023.\n\nFluctuations in these exchange rates increase the volatility of the Company's cost measures reported in U.S. dollars. The Company periodically undertakes to purchase, in advance, a portion of its foreign denominated cash flow requirements on a spot or forward basis to reduce this exposure. The Company also enters into foreign exchange option contracts in order to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. In 2022, approximately 89% of Namibian dollar operating expenses for 2022 were hedged with option contracts providing, on a US$/ZAR basis, a weighted average floor rate of 15.12 and a weighted average ceiling rate of 17.03. In addition, approximately 86% and 14% of projected Namibian dollar operating expenses for 2023 and 2024, respectively, have been hedged with option contracts providing a weighted average floor rate of 15.69 for 2023 and 16.55 for 2024, and a weighted average ceiling rate of 17.69 for 2023 and 19.35 for 2024. The Company currently has no Euro or Canadian dollar hedges in place.\n\n## Energy costs\n\nEnergy costs are the single largest cost to the Company's producing mines other than labour costs, representing approximately 15% of its total mine cash cost at an average annual consumption rate of approximately 165,000 megawatt hours ('MWh'). The fluctuation in energy costs can also impact the Company's key cost measures and results of operations.\n\nIn 2022, global economic activity experienced a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than seen in several decades. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic heavily distorted global energy supply chains. Despite gas prices retreating from the highs in late 2022, the cost of energy for Europe remains multiple times that of North America.\n\nThe Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines are located in Bulgaria, Eastern Europe. As Bulgaria is a net exporter of power, Chelopech and Ada Tepe are not currently reliant on Russia for their power needs. In addition, the Company's exposures to the rising prices for energy were mitigated by the Bulgarian government power subsidies starting from October 2021 and through to the end of 2023. The power subsidies were applicable to both residential and commercial business operations to mitigate the surge in electricity prices. In 2022, the Company paid an average of Bulgarian lev 269 per MWh ($147 per MWh), net of the government power subsidy, which was based on progressive measures enacted through the year with set price thresholds per MWh. On November 8, 2022, the Bulgarian government extended the existing compensation program to mitigate the effects of high electricity costs for businesses until the end of 2023, under which Chelopech and Ada Tepe are expected to pay Bulgarian lev 200 per MWh (approximately $110 per MWh) on a net basis.",

In aggregate, approximately 25% to 30% of the Company's mine and smelter cash costs are directly or indirectly impacted by fuel costs. Fuel costs are affected directly by the crude oil prices, and therefore, fluctuations in the crude oil prices can also impact the Company's key cost measures and results of operations.\n\nCrude oil prices typically fluctuate based on seasonal demand and supply and global political and economic events. The main benchmark for fuel prices is Brent Crude, which gained approximately 10% in 2022, after jumping 50% in 2021. Russia and China are expected to be the key countries shaping the oil price forecast in 2023, as the oil prices are expected to be driven by the balance between the tightening Russian supply and China's demand growth.\n\nBulgaria imports oil from Russia which is refined by a Bulgarian entity ultimately controlled by a Russian oil company that is a designated entity under Canadian and U.S. sanctions and subject to sectoral sanctions in the European Union ('EU'). The Bulgarian subsidiaries of DPM procure fuel from this refinery from Bulgarian suppliers. In the event that existing sanctions are not eliminated and the exemption from the Council of Europe's sanctions in favour of Bulgaria with respect to the import of Russian oil is not extended or other sanctions otherwise prevent Bulgaria from importing Russian oil or prevent the Company from otherwise procuring fuel refined in Bulgaria, the costs of procuring fuel for the Company's operations in Bulgaria may be significantly increased. For a detailed discussion related to the conflict in Ukraine and its impact to DPM, please see the 'Risks and Uncertainties' section later in this MD&A.\n\nThe Company does not have any oil hedges in place.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company held cash of $433.2 million, investments valued at $40.8 million primarily related to its 6.5% interest in Sabina, and $150.0 million of undrawn capacity under its RCF.\n\nThe Company's liquidity is impacted by several factors which include, but are not limited to, gold, copper and sulphuric acid market prices, production levels, capital expenditures, operating cash costs, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These factors are monitored by the Company on a regular basis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company's cash resources and available capital under its RCF continue to provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its current operating and capital expenditure requirements, all contractual commitments, as well as a number of margin improvement and growth-related expenditures. The Company may, from time to time, raise additional capital or amend its RCF to ensure it maintains its financial strength and has sufficient liquidity to support the funding requirements associated with one or more of its growth capital projects and the overall needs of the business.\n\nAs part of the Company's assessment of the potential implications associated with the conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company assessed its financial resources as at December 31, 2022 and concluded that it has sufficient available cash resources to manage the potential impacts that could reasonably be expected to arise.\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nAs part of its strategy, the Company adheres to a disciplined capital allocation framework that is based on three fundamental considerations - balance sheet strength, reinvestment in the business, and the return of excess capital to shareholders. Maintaining a strong balance sheet includes ensuring adequate liquidity, managing within prudent financial metrics, and building a strong cash position to support accretive growth. Reinvestment  in  the  business  includes  investing  in  its  operating  assets  to  sustain  and  optimize performance; investing in resource development to extend the life of its mines and to identify new gold resources; further advancing existing resources towards production; as well as investing in new projects to grow beyond its existing asset base. Returning capital to shareholders includes dividends, and under",

Accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets decreased by $1.7 million to $177.7 million due primarily to the timing of deliveries and subsequent receipt of cash. Investments at fair value decreased by $7.2 million to $40.8 million due primarily to the decrease in Sabina's share price. Non-current assets, excluding investments at fair value, decreased by $101.1 million to $505.6 million due primarily to the Tsumeb impairment charge, and depreciation and depletion, partially offset by capital expenditures.\n\nCurrent liabilities increased by $11.1 million to $96.9 million during 2022 due primarily to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments to suppliers and an increase in the current portion of rehabilitation provisions. Non-current liabilities decreased by $10.9 million to $67.3 million due primarily to a decrease in rehabilitation provisions as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar and higher discount rates, partially offset by a higher inflation rate, as well as a decrease in share-based compensation liabilities as a result of the decrease in DPM's share price. Equity attributable to common shareholders decreased by $11.3 million to $993.1 million due primarily to the Tsumeb impairment charge, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized losses on publicly traded securities, dividends declared and shares repurchased, partially offset by adjusted net earnings for the year.",

$48.0 million), the vast majority of which related to the value of its investment in Sabina common shares and special warrants. In September 2022, 5,000,000 Series B special warrants were exercised in return for 5,000,000 common shares by DPM following a positive production decision with respect to the Back River project. As at December 31, 2022, DPM held 36,050,566 common shares of Sabina, representing a 6.5% ownership interest in Sabina with a fair market value of $35.4 million (Cdn$47.9 million).",

        "page_content": "On February 13, 2023, B2Gold Corp ('B2Gold') and Sabina announced that the parties have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which B2Gold has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Sabrina through issuing 0.3867 of a common share of B2Gold for each Sabina common share, representing a consideration of Cdn$1.87 per Sabina share on a fully-diluted basis based on the closing price of B2Gold on the TSX as at February 10, 2023. As a result, DPM's ownership interest in Sabina would be valued at $49.8 million (Cdn$67.4 million) based on Cdn$1.87 per Sabina share under this transaction.\n\nThis transaction is subject to Sabina shareholders' approval, as well as normal course regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\n## Commodity Swap Contracts\n\nThe Company is subject to price risk associated with fluctuations in the market prices for metals. The Company regularly enters into QP Hedges to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between  the  provisional  and  final  determination  of  its  concentrate  sales.  In  addition,  the  Company periodically enters into Production Hedges to reduce the price exposure associated with projected payable copper production.\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges as cash flow hedges and the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges as fair value hedges.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on commodity swap contracts is calculated based on the corresponding LME forward copper prices and New York Commodity Exchange forward gold prices, as applicable. As at December 31, 2022, the impact of a 5% increase or decrease in metal prices impacting the Company's accounts receivable on provisionally priced sales (the hedged item) and outstanding commodity swap contracts (the hedging instrument), with all other variables held constant, would decrease or increase earnings before income taxes by $0.6 million (2021 - $2.0 million) and would decrease or increase equity by $0.6 million (2021 - $2.0 million).\n\n## Foreign Exchange Option Contracts\n\nThe Company's foreign currency exposures arise primarily from a significant portion of its operating and capital costs being denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company's functional currency. The Company enters into foreign exchange option contracts in order to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange option contracts are entered into, to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' rate and participation up to a specified 'ceiling' rate. The option contracts entered into are comprised of a series of call options and put options (which when combined create a price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nThe Company designates the intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts as cash flow hedges. The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on foreign exchange option contracts was calculated based on foreign exchange forward rates quoted in the market. As at December 31, 2022, approximately 86% of the Company's 2023 projected Namibian dollar operating expenses, which is linked to the ZAR, have been hedged. A 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease equity by $0.8 million (2021 - $1.9 million). The effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would have no impact on equity.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to credit and liquidity risks in the event of non-performance by counterparties in connection with its commodity swap contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. These risks, which are monitored on a regular basis, are mitigated, in part, by entering into transactions with financially sound counterparties  and,  where  possible,  ensuring  contracts  are  governed  by  legally  enforceable  master agreements.",

Estimates and assumptions are evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  significant  areas  of  estimation  and  uncertainty  considered  by  management  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to:",

        "page_content": "## Mineral exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the assessment of technical and operational feasibility and the determination of an identified Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve's commercial viability.\n\nThe application of the Company's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditures requires judgment in determining whether it is probable that future economic benefits will be generated from the exploitation of an exploration and evaluation asset when activities have not yet reached a stage where a reasonable assessment of the existence of Mineral Reserves can be determined. The estimation of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic and geological data and these assumptions and estimates impact the decision to either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances in order to determine if an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information becomes available after expenditures have been capitalized that the recovery of these expenditures is no longer probable, the expenditures capitalized are written down to the recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.\n\n## Mine properties\n\n## Commencement of commercial production\n\nAll expenditures undertaken in the development, construction, installation and/or completion of mine production  facilities  are  capitalized  and  initially  classified  as  'Mines  under  construction'.  Upon  the commencement of commercial production, all related assets included in 'Mines under construction' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\nDetermination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the mine is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The Company considers primarily the following factors, among others, when determining the commencement of commercial production:\n\n- x All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- x A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- x A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- x Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\n\n## Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates\n\nThe estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as defined under NI 43-101 is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The Company prepares its Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the orebody which is compiled by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are based upon factors such as metal prices, capital requirements, production costs, foreign exchange rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the orebody. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, together with forecast production, determine the life of mine estimates and therefore changes in the Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, rehabilitation provisions and deferred income tax assets.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the carrying values of mine properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment or reversal of previously recognized impairment exist. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount",

        "page_content": "is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use based on discounted cash flows. This is determined on an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, individual assets are grouped together into a Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Management has assessed the Company's CGUs as being an individual operating site.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors for each CGU. External factors include market considerations ranging from overall economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to changes in commodity prices, toll rates, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and regulatory requirements. Internal factors include considerations such as production volume, ability to convert resources into reserves, capital and operating expenditures, and future development and expansion plans.\n\nThese significant estimates and assumptions, some of which may be subjective, require that management make decisions based on the best available information at each reporting period. It is possible that the actual recoverable amount could be significantly different than those estimates. A significant decline in the asset's market value, reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Company's assets. Judgment is also required when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge in respect of Tsumeb of $85.0 million. Tsumeb's recoverable amount of $40.0 million was determined using FVLCD, which was calculated based on projected future cash flows utilizing the latest information available and management's estimates including throughput ranging from 230,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes, toll rates and volumes based on historical terms received and the Company's knowledge of the complex concentrate market, lower operating costs, sustaining capital expenditures in line with current levels, and the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the ZAR of 17.05. These projected cash flows were prepared in current dollars and discounted using a real discount rate of 10.79%, representing the estimated weighted average real cost of capital. This rate was estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model where the costs of equity and debt were based on, among other things, estimated interest rates, market returns on equity, share volatility, leverage and risks specific to the mining sector and Tsumeb.\n\nThe projected cash flows and FVLCD for Tsumeb can be affected by any one or more changes in the estimates used. Changes in third party toll rates, operating costs, foreign exchange rates and volumes of concentrate smelted have the greatest impact on value, where a 5% change in any one of above assumptions would each change the FVLCD by approximately $30 million to $35 million as at December 31, 2022. In addition, if Tsumeb does not achieve forecasted operating levels and future cost savings in respect of its initiative to optimize the cost structure of the smelter, there could be a further impairment charge.\n\n## Rehabilitation provisions\n\nMining, processing, development and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. The Company recognizes a liability for its rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the riskfree nominal discount rates that are specific to the countries in which the operations are located.\n\nThe nature of these restoration and rehabilitation activities includes: i) dismantling and removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made by management in determining the nature and costs associated with the rehabilitation liability. The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the",

        "page_content": "timing, extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technology changes, regulatory changes, and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.\n\nChanges in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the rehabilitation liability as well as changes to environmental laws and regulations could cause material changes in the expected cost and expected future settlement value.\n\nAt as December 31, 2022, the undiscounted future cost for estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs before inflation was estimated to be $83.4 million. The carrying value of the estimated mine closure and rehabilitation cost was $50.9 million at December 31, 2022 and $51.6 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Revenue recognition related to toll smelting arrangements\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is recognized when concentrate has been smelted and is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed and prevailing market conditions at the time the agreement was entered. Revenue from processing concentrate is adjusted for any over or under recoveries of metals delivered relative to contracted rates under the tolling agreement between Tsumeb and IXM. These adjustments represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage accountable in the IXM contract to (ii) the accountable copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the in-circuit material still being processed by Tsumeb.\n\nMany aspects of the metal exposure are subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company's accounts receivable included a metal recovery of $15.5 million (December 31, 2021 - $2.2 million) related to estimated metal exposure at Tsumeb.\n\n## Deferred income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences on the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nJudgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  the consolidated statements of financial position. Deferred income tax assets, including those arising from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred income tax assets recorded on the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities.",

These measures have no standardized meanings under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The definitions established and calculations performed by DPM are based on management's reasonable judgment and are consistently applied. These measures are used by management and investors to assist with assessing the Company's performance, including its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its return objectives and support its investing activities and debt service obligations. In addition, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain of these measures, together with other measures, to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance. These measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, together with other financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS, are considered to be important factors that assist investors in assessing the Company's performance.\n\n## Non-GAAP Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Cost Measures\n\nMine cash cost; smelter cash cost; mine cash cost of sales; and all-in sustaining cost are non-GAAP financial measures. Cash cost per tonne of ore processed; cash cost per ounce of gold sold; all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold; and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted are non-GAAP ratios. These measures capture the important components of the Company's production and related costs. Management and investors utilize these metrics as an important tool to monitor cost performance at the Company's operations.

        "page_content": "The operating results and financial condition of the Company are subject to a number of inherent risks and uncertainties  associated  with  its  business  activities,  which  include  the  acquisition,  exploration, development, financing, construction, commissioning and operation of its mine, mill and concentrate processing facilities. The operating results and financial condition are also subject to numerous external factors, which include economic, social, geopolitical, including military conflicts, environmental, regulatory, health, legal, tax and market risks impacting, among other things, precious metals and copper prices, sulphuric acid prices, toll rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation, the availability and cost of capital to fund the capital requirements of the business and the supply chain related to the business, uncertainty of production and cost estimates and the potential for unexpected costs and expenses, and changes in general economic conditions or conditions in the financial markets. Each of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future business, results of operations and financial condition, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any Forward Looking Statements contained in this MD&A. The Company endeavours to manage these risks and uncertainties in a balanced manner with a view to mitigating risk while maximizing total shareholder returns. The Company continually strives to identify and to effectively manage the risks of each of its business units. This includes developing appropriate risk management strategies, policies, processes and systems. There can be no assurance that the Company has been or will be successful in identifying all risks or that any risk-mitigating strategies adopted to reduce or eliminate risk will be successful.\n\nThe following subsections describe some of the more significant business risks and uncertainties affecting the Company. These risks, along with other potential risks not specifically discussed in this MD&A, should be considered when evaluating the Company and its three-year outlook along with the more comprehensive discussion of risks contained in the 'Risk Factors' section of our most recent Annual Information Form. Additional risks not identified below may affect the Company.\n\n## Metal Prices\n\nThe fluctuation in the price of a metal sold by the Company can significantly impact revenues as well as allin sustaining cost per ounce of gold and other cost measures that are reported net of by-product credits. Accordingly, the prices of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, and, in turn, the price for its common shares.\n\nMetal prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including overall global market conditions; the sale or purchase of gold and silver by various central banks, financial institutions and Exchange Traded Funds; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; inflation or deflation; global and regional supply and demand; and the political and economic conditions of major gold, silver and copper producing and consuming countries throughout the world. If gold and/or copper prices were to decline significantly from current levels, there can be no assurance that cash flow from operations, together with cash on hand and available credit under the Company's RCF, will be sufficient to meet the Company's operating and capital requirements, including its contractual commitments and mandatory debt repayments, and the Company could be forced to discontinue production, reassess the feasibility of a particular project, and/or could lose its interest in, or be forced to sell, some of its properties. In addition, a significant commodity price decline could result in significant reductions in Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of one or more of the Company's cash generating units and result in an impairment of the carrying value of certain assets, including exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, and property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn accordance with established risk management policies approved by our Board of Directors, the Company enters into QP Hedges to reduce the metal price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional  and  final  determination  of  concentrate  sales.  The  Company  also  selectively  enters  into Production Hedges to reduce its price exposure on future sales and in respect of certain cost measures that are impacted by variability in by-product metal credits. These Production Hedges are entered primarily to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' price and, to reduce the upfront cost of these contracts, are typically accompanied by option contracts that provide price participation up to a specified 'ceiling' price. The Company sells and hedges gold and copper metal contained in concentrates produced at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on major commodity exchanges, including the LME and the LBMA.",

        "page_content": "## Conflict in Ukraine\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine which, as of the date hereof, is still ongoing. Given the role each country plays around global energy and agricultural trade, the international community's imposition of a variety of sanctions on Russia, and the withdrawal of foreign products and services to Russia, this invasion is putting further strains on the global supply chain and adding additional pricing pressure above and beyond what previously was attributable to COVID-19.\n\nThe Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines are located in Bulgaria, Eastern Europe. Bulgaria does not share a border with either Russia or Ukraine and is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the EU. The main sources of Bulgaria's electric energy are nuclear and coal facilities, which together comprise approximately 80% of Bulgaria's total energy generation. Although Russia has halted natural gas deliveries to Bulgaria, approximately 5% of Bulgaria's total energy supply is generated from natural gas and DPM has not experienced and does not anticipate any disruption of power supply to its mines as a result. In June 2022, the Council of Europe adopted sanctions that, among other things, prohibit the purchase, import or transfer of crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU. A temporary exemption is available for those EU member states that, due to their geographic situation, suffer from a specific dependence on Russian supplies and have no viable alternative options. Bulgaria has secured this exemption until end of 2024. As a result, the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the Company has been limited to date to increased costs for energy, fuel and other direct materials.\n\nFurther escalation of the conflict, including an outbreak of and/or expansion of hostilities into other countries or regions within Europe could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations due to, among other factors, disruption in the Company's supply chain, increased input costs, and increased risk (or perception of increased risk) in the profile of the Company's operations in Eastern Europe. In addition, Bulgaria imports oil from Russia which is refined by a Bulgarian entity ultimately controlled by a Russian oil company that is a designated entity under Canadian and U.S. sanctions and subject to sectoral sanctions in the EU. The Bulgarian subsidiaries of DPM procure fuel from this refinery from Bulgarian suppliers. In the event that existing sanctions are not eliminated and the exemption from the Council of Europe's sanctions in favour of Bulgaria with respect to the import of Russian oil is not extended or other sanctions otherwise prevent Bulgaria from importing Russian oil or prevent the Company from otherwise procuring fuel refined in Bulgaria, the costs of procuring fuel for the Company's operations in Bulgaria may be significantly increased. The Company continues to monitor this evolving situation and will proactively manage the situation, although there is no assurance that the Company's operations will not be adversely affected by current geopolitical tensions and/or associated government sanctions.\n\n## Inflation and Global Economic Conditions\n\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other events, the global economy has faced significant instability marked by increased inflation and supply chain issues. Global economic conditions could further deteriorate, and the economy may contract and enter into a recession. Additionally, future economic shocks may be precipitated by a number of causes, including a rise in the price of oil, geopolitical instability, natural disasters and outbreaks of medical endemic or pandemic issues. Any sudden or rapid destabilization of global economic conditions could impact the Company's ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on terms favorable to the Company. Additionally, any such occurrence could cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment charges. Further, in such an event, the Company's operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\n\nIn addition to potentially affecting the price of gold, copper and silver, general inflationary pressures may also affect labor, commodity and other input costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and capital expenditures for the development of its projects.  Over  the  course  of  2022,  global  inflationary  pressures  increased  driven  by  supply  chain disruptions. Global energy costs have also increased significantly following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. The Company has been impacted by these inflationary pressures in the form of higher costs for key inputs required for its operations, most notably higher energy costs. The Company has made assumptions around the expected costs of these key inputs, and the Company's actual costs in an inflationary environment may differ materially from those assumptions. These inflationary impacts may be felt directly through purchases of diesel and fuel, as well as through higher transportation costs, and indirectly through higher costs of products which rely on energy as an input cost.",

        "page_content": "## Smelter Toll Rates, Sulphuric Acid Prices, Metal Recoveries and Feed\n\nThe availability of sufficient volumes of high value complex concentrate, at suitable toll rates, is critical to the ongoing viability and profitability of the Tsumeb smelter, given the fixed cost nature of the operation. To facilitate the procurement of complex concentrates, the Company entered into an agreement with IXM that currently matures on December 31, 2026. There is no assurance that this agreement will be renewed with IXM upon its expiry.\n\nUnder this agreement, the Company typically secures complex concentrate volumes at specified toll rates covering the next 12-24 months. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has contracted high value complex concentrate covering over 90% of its expected concentrate requirements through to the end of 2023. There can be no assurance that such concentrate will be available to the smelter in the future or that the parties will agree on contracted toll rates that will be sufficient to generate an adequate return. From time to time the Company may increase the amount of third party concentrate and reduce the amount of Chelopech concentrate processed at Tsumeb. To the extent the volume of complex concentrate from Chelopech is reduced at Tsumeb, it can affect the profitability of the Tsumeb smelter. Failure to find sufficient quantities of suitable high value complex concentrate to be processed at acceptable toll rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nUnder the agreement with IXM, Tsumeb must return specified quantities of copper, gold and silver, and maintain specified maximum levels of in-process metal. Metal over and under recoveries at the smelter are subject to smelter processing capabilities, contracted terms, and various estimates, including the quantities of metal contained in concentrate received, material in-process and blister delivered. These estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge and multiple assay results. Actual metal deliveries could differ materially from initial estimates and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations as any over or under recovery of metals is recorded in revenue. In the event that in-process metals at the smelter exceed specified maximum contractual levels, Tsumeb may be required to purchase such excess in-process metal. IXM may agree to waive such purchase requirement, and has done so in 2021 and 2022, when in-process metal exceeded maximum contractual levels.\n\nTsumeb produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of the smelting operation. Historically, the vast majority of this sulphuric acid has been sold to customers in Namibia, with the balance exported to other countries in Africa. The revenue from sulphuric acid sales makes up approximately 15% to 20% of Tsumeb's revenue and changes in the market price of and demand for sulphuric acid can have a material impact on Tsumeb's financial results. As at December 31, 2022, approximately 85% of Tsumeb's forecast sulphuric acid production over the next three years is expected to be sold domestically under a reference price contract which includes floor and ceiling prices. The remainder of Tsumeb's sulphuric acid production is expected to be sold at market terms under spot or longer-term agreements. An inability to sell or deliver sufficient acid production whereby Tsumeb's sulphuric acid storage capacity is exceeded would result in a reduction of smelter operating levels up to and including a full stoppage.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nBy virtue of its international operations, the Company incurs costs and expenses in a number of foreign currencies. The revenue from its mining and smelting operations received by the Company is denominated in U.S. dollars since the prices of the metals that it produces are referenced in U.S. dollars, while the majority of operating and capital expenditures of its mining and smelter operations are denominated in Bulgarian lev, which is pegged to the Euro, the Namibian dollar, which is tied to the ZAR, and the Canadian dollar. Fluctuations in these foreign exchange rates give rise to foreign exchange exposures, either favourable or unfavourable, which could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies can also have an impact on commodity prices quoted in U.S. dollars, such that a stronger U.S. dollar tends to have a negative impact on U.S. quoted prices while a weaker U.S. dollar tends to have a favourable impact. As a result, this relationship is considered in conjunction with the Company's risk assessment.",

Such risks include, without limitation, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, disruptions in the supply of critical materials and supplies, disruptions due to pandemic conditions, delays in obtaining work visas or other authorizations, labour disputes, changes in laws, technical difficulties or failures, equipment failure, failure of retaining dams around tailings disposal areas which may result in environmental pollution and consequent liability, unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding and other conditions involved in the drilling and removal of material. Such risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines and other processing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage, delays in mining and processing, delays in scheduled maintenance, losses and possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at the Company's mining and processing facilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSuccess of the Company's operations also depends on adequate public infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supplies are important determinants which affect capital and operating costs. Natural events, such as seismic events and severe climatic conditions, as well as sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\n\nThe Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves disclosed by the Company are estimates and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved or that the indicated level of recovery will be realized. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Such estimation is a subjective process and the accuracy of any estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that gold, silver or copper recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\n\nFluctuations in gold, silver and copper prices, results of drilling, change in cut-off grades, metallurgical testing, production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates may require revision of such Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. The volume and grade of Mineral Reserves mined and processed, and the recovery rates achieved may not be the same as currently anticipated. Any material reduction in the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant decrease in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, and estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs, and could result in an impairment of the carrying value.\n\n## Need for Mineral Reserves\n\nAs mines have limited lives based on Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, the Company must continually develop, replace and expand its Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources as its mines produce gold, copper and silver concentrates. The Company's ability to maintain or increase its annual production of gold, copper and silver and its aggregate Mineral Reserves will be significantly dependent on its ability to expand its Mineral Resource base both at its existing mines and new mines it intends to bring into production in the future.",

        "page_content": "## Exploration\n\nExploration is speculative and involves many risks that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge utilized by the Company may not eliminate. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible. Substantial expenditures are normally required to locate and establish Mineral Reserves and to permit and construct mining and processing facilities. While the discovery of mineralization may result in substantial rewards if an orebody is proven, few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\n\n## Financing, Interest Rate and Liquidity\n\nThe Company relies on the cash flows generated from its mining and smelting operations, including provisional payments received from its customers, cash on hand, available credit under its RCF, and its ability to raise debt and equity from the capital markets to fund its operating, investment and liquidity needs. The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses, general economic conditions and the volatility of capital markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating capability, its ability to maintain, or draw upon, its RCF or the existing terms under its concentrate sales or toll agreements, as well as its liquidity, cost of capital and its ability to access additional capital, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in turn, could affect total shareholder returns. To reduce these risks, the Company: (i) prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity and compliance with its debt covenants; (ii) strives to maintain a prudent capital structure that is comprised primarily of equity financing and a long-term committed RCF; and (iii) targets a minimum level of liquidity comprised of surplus cash balances and/or available committed lines of credit to avoid being placed into a situation where it is required to raise additional capital at times when the costs or terms would be regarded as unfavourable.\n\nThe Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments, as well as potential interest paid on future drawdowns under its RCF, which is based on a floating reference rate.\n\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company's operations will be profitable or that the Company will be able to raise capital on terms that it considers reasonable. Adverse commodity market, general economic conditions and adverse capital market conditions could result in a delay or the indefinite postponement of development or construction projects and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\n\n## Environmental, Health and Safety\n\nMining and smelting operations, including exploration, development and production of mineral deposits and disposal of tailings and hazardous materials, generally involve a high degree of risk and are subject to conditions and events beyond the Company's control. The Company's operations are subject to all of the hazards  and  risks  normally  encountered  in  the  mining  and  smelting  sectors  including:  adverse environmental conditions; industrial and environmental accidents; metallurgical and other processing problems; unusual or unexpected rock formations; ground or slope failures; structural cave-ins or slides; flooding or fires; seismic activity; rock bursts; equipment failures; failures to contain hazardous materials (including arsenic) within the designated areas; and periodic interruptions due to weather conditions; as well as intentional acts by individuals or groups who intend to harm or disrupt the Company's operations. These  risks  could  result  in  the  destruction  of  mines  or  processing  facilities,  the  failure  of  tailings management facilities and damage to infrastructure, causing partial or complete shutdowns, personal injury or death, environmental or other damage to the Company's properties or the properties of others, monetary losses and potential legal liability. Although the Company conducts extensive maintenance and monitoring and incurs significant costs to maintain its operations, equipment and infrastructure, including tailings management facilities, unanticipated failures or damage may occur that could cause injuries, production loss or environmental pollution resulting in significant legal and/or economic liability.\n\nThe Company's mining and smelting operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations address, among other things, emissions; air and water quality standards; land use; rehabilitation and reclamation; and safety and work environment  standards,  including  human  rights.  They  also  set  forth  limitations  on  the  generation,",

        "page_content": "transportation, storage and disposal of various wastes, including hazardous wastes. Environmental, health and safety legislation continues to evolve and, while the Company takes active steps to monitor this legislation, it could result in stricter standards and enforcement, increased capital and operating costs and burdens  to  achieve  compliance,  increased  fines  and  penalties  for  non-compliance,  more  stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the Company's mining, processing, development and exploration activities, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause increases in exploration expenses, capital expenditures, production costs or future rehabilitation costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties and/or expansion of existing properties.\n\nEnvironmental hazards may exist on the properties in which the Company holds interests, which are unknown to the Company at present, and which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties. The Company may also acquire properties with known or undiscovered environmental risk. Any indemnifications by the previous owners or others may not be adequate to pay all the fines, penalties and costs incurred related to such properties. Some of the Company's properties have also been used for mining, processing, smelting and related operations for many years before the Company acquired them and were acquired 'as is' or with assumed environmental liabilities from previous owners or operators. The Company has been required to address contamination at its properties in the past and may need to do so in the future, either for existing environmental conditions or for leaks, discharges or contamination that may arise from its ongoing operations or other contingencies. The cost of addressing environmental conditions or risks, and liabilities associated with environmental damage may be significant, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Production at the Company's mines and processing facilities involves the use of various chemicals, including certain chemicals that are designated as hazardous substances. Contamination from hazardous substances, either at the Company's own properties or other locations for which it may be responsible, may subject the Company to liability for the investigation or remediation of contamination, as well as for claims seeking to recover costs for related property damage, personal injury or damage to natural resources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn 2016, the Company completed a major multi-year capital program at its smelter in Namibia directed at modernizing the environmental equipment being utilized and debottlenecking its processing capacity. This included the completion of a sulphuric acid plant, which has reduced the plant's SO2 emissions. The Company  is  committed  to  making  further  improvements  to  the  health,  safety  and  environmental performance of the smelter and is continuously assessing the scope of any capital expenditures required to support these further improvements. The Company's environmental and occupational health and safety performance will be subject to continued monitoring by the Namibian authorities and deviation from expected environmental and occupational health and safety outcomes could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future production, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 epidemic as a worldwide pandemic and governments across the globe undertook extensive measures to combat the spread of this virus. To date, as a result of the proactive actions being taken within the regions in which we operate and by personnel at each of our sites, the Company has not experienced any material disruptions to its operations as a result of COVID-19 and all operations are currently operating at full capacity.\n\nThe Company continues to closely assess and monitor the COVID-19 situation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. At present, there do not appear to be any imminent COVID-19 related circumstances that are expected to disrupt the Company's operations, however, recognizing that the situation remains dynamic, the Company is not able to reliably estimate the likelihood, timing, duration, severity and scope of this pandemic and the potential impact it could have on the Company's operating and financial results. There is no assurance that the pandemic will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the Company.",

Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company's DC&P and ICFR were designed and operating effectively as at December 31, 2022.\n\nNI 52-109 also requires Canadian public companies to disclose in their MD&A any change in ICFR that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. No material changes were made to the ICFR in the year ended December 31, 2022. Only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that misstatements are prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR can be provided due to the inherent limitations of the ICFR system. Such limitations also apply to the effectiveness of ICFR as it is also possible that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\n## CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements and other information included in this MD&A and our other disclosure documents constitute 'forward looking information' or 'forward looking statements' within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, which we refer to collectively hereinafter as 'Forward Looking Statements'.\n\nForward Looking Statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as 'plans', 'expects', 'is expected', 'budget', 'scheduled', 'estimates', 'forecasts', 'guidance', 'outlook', 'intends', 'anticipates', 'believes', or variations of such words and phrases or that state that certain actions, events or results 'may', 'could', 'would', 'might' or 'will' be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms or similar expressions.

In addition to factors already discussed in this document, such factors include, among others: fluctuations in metal and sulphuric acid prices, toll rates and foreign exchange rates; risks arising from the current inflationary environment and the impact on operating costs and other financial metrics, including risks of recession and the risk that the power subsidy in Bulgaria may be discontinued; continuation or escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, including the continued exemption from the Council of Europe's sanctions in favour of Bulgaria with respect to the import of Russian oil and economic sanctions against Russia and Russian persons which may impact supply chains; risks relating to the Company's business generally and the impact of global pandemics, including COVID-19, resulting in changes to the Company's supply chain, product shortages, delivery and shipping issues, closure and/or failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated, employees and contractors becoming infected, low vaccination rates, lost work hours and labour force shortages; regulatory changes, including changes impacting the complex concentrate market; inability of Tsumeb to secure complex copper concentrate on terms that are economic; possible variations in ore grade and recovery rates; inherent uncertainties in respect of conclusions of economic evaluations, economic studies and mine plans, including the Loma Larga FS; uncertainties with respect to timing of the updated Loma Larga FS; changes in project parameters, including schedule and budget, as plans continue to be refined; uncertainties with respect to realizing the anticipated benefits from the development of the Loma Larga gold project; uncertainties with respect to actual results of current exploration activities; uncertainties and risks inherent to developing and commissioning new mines into production, which may be subject to unforeseen delays; uncertainties inherent with conducting business in foreign jurisdictions where corruption, civil unrest, political instability and uncertainties with the rule of law may impact the Company's activities; limitations on insurance coverage; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining  industry;  delays  in  obtaining  governmental  approvals  or  financing  or  in  the  completion  of development  or  construction  activities;  actual  results  of  current  and  planned  reclamation  activities; opposition by social and non-governmental organizations to mining projects and smelting operations; unanticipated title disputes; claims or litigation; failure to achieve certain cost savings or the potential benefits of any upgrades and/or expansion, including the potential rotary holding furnace installation at the Tsumeb smelter; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity risks; there being no assurance that the Company will purchase additional common shares of the Company under the NCIB; risks related to the timing, completion and expected benefit of the acquisition by B2Gold of Sabina; risks related to the implementation, cost and realization of benefits from digital initiatives; uncertainties with respect to realizing the targeted MineRP earn-outs as well as those risk factors discussed or referred to in any other documents (including without limitation the Company's most recent AIF) filed from time to time with the securities regulatory authorities in all provinces and territories of Canada and available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company's Forward Looking Statements.\n\nThe Forward Looking Statements are based on what the Company's management considers to be reasonable assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions based on the information currently available to it. Without limitation to the foregoing, the following section outlines certain specific Forward Looking Statements contained in the 'Three-Year Outlook' section of this MD&A, unless otherwise noted, and provides certain material assumptions used to develop such Forward Looking Statements and material risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Forward Looking Statements (which are provided without limitation to the additional general risk factors discussed herein):\n\nOre processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines perform at planned levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which is failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe ore mined/milled are in line with the guidance provided; foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels; and operating expenses at Chelopech and Ada Tepe are at planned levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which  are:  lower  than  anticipated  ore  mined/milled;  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar  relative  to  the  Euro;  and unexpected increases in labour and other operating costs.\n\nMetals  contained  in  concentrate  produced: assumes  grades  and  recoveries  are  consistent  with current  estimates  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  and  DPM's  current  expectations; and  ore",

        "page_content": "mined/milled is consistent with guidance. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated ore grades, recovery rates and ore mined/milled.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost: assumes that metals contained in concentrate produced and cash cost per tonne of ore processed at Chelopech and Ada Tepe are each in line with the guidance provided; copper and silver prices remain at or around current levels; the timing, destination and commercial terms in respect of concentrate deliveries are consistent with DPM's current expectations; payable metals in concentrate sold are consistent with the guidance provided; and general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditures and leases are consistent with the guidance provided. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated metals contained in concentrate produced; concentrate deliveries and metal prices; a higher than anticipated cash cost per tonne of ore processed; and higher than anticipated sustaining capital expenditures, leases and general and administrative expenses.\n\nComplex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb: assumes no significant disruption in equipment availability, planned maintenance activities or concentrate supply. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: unanticipated operational issues; delays in maintenance activities; lower than anticipated equipment availability; and disruptions to or changes in the supply of complex concentrate, including changes in the proportion of third party and Chelopech feed.\n\nCash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted: assumes complex concentrate smelted is consistent with the guidance provided; no delays in planned maintenance activities; sulphuric acid prices are at or around current levels; sulphuric acid production and operating expenses are at planned levels; and foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated complex concentrate smelted and sulphuric acid production;; lower than anticipated sulphuric acid prices; strengthening of the ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar; and higher than anticipated operating and transportation costs due to a variety of factors, including higher than anticipated inflation, labour and other operating costs.\n\nSustaining and growth capital expenditures: assumes foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels, and all capital projects proceed as planned and at a cost that is consistent with the budget established for each project. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: technical challenges, delays related to securing necessary permits and approvals, equipment deliveries, equipment performance, and the speed with which work is performed; availability of qualified labour; and changes in project parameters and estimated costs, including foreign exchange impacts.\n\nLiquidity (see comments contained in 'Liquidity and Capital Resources' section): assumes the operating and cost performance are consistent with current expectations; metal and sulphuric acid prices, and foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels; concentrate and sulphuric acid sales agreements, and smelter toll terms are consistent with current terms and/or forecast levels; progress of capital projects is consistent with current expectations; and DPM's RCF remains in place. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated metals production at Chelopech and Ada Tepe, complex concentrate throughput and sulphuric acid production at Tsumeb, concentrate deliveries and metal prices; lower than anticipated reductions in secondary material at Tsumeb; a weaker U.S. dollar relative to local operating currencies; changes in contractual sales and/or toll terms and sulphuric acid prices; changes to capital project parameters, schedule and/or costs; and the inability to draw down on DPM's RCF due to a breach or potential breach of one of its covenants.\n\nGeneral: assumes ability to carry on exploration and development activities; ability to operate in a safe, efficient and effective manner; no significant unanticipated operational or technical difficulties; maintenance of good relations with the communities surrounding Chelopech, Ada Tepe, Tsumeb and Loma Larga; no significant events or changes relating to regulatory, environmental, health and safety matters, and no significant negative effects as a result of , including that the Company does not experience any significant negative effects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and current economic conditions, including inflationary impacts, beyond what has been factored into the Company's Forward Looking Statements.\n\nThe reader is cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which may have been used. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward Looking Statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended.",

The Company's Forward Looking Statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and are only as of the date hereof. Other than as it may be required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update Forward Looking Statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinion should change. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Forward Looking Statements.\n\n## CAUTIONARY  NOTE  TO  UNITED  STATES  INVESTORS  CONCERNING  DIFFERENCES  IN  REPORTING  OF MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\n\nThis MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ  from  the  requirements  of  United  States  securities  laws.  Canadian  reporting  requirements  for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 (the 'SEC Modernization Rules') with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining issuers that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred mineral resources'. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of 'proven mineral reserves' and 'probable mineral reserves' to be 'substantially similar' to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\n\nReaders are cautioned that while the above terms are 'substantially similar' to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources that the Company may report as 'proven mineral reserves', 'probable mineral reserves', 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred mineral resources' under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.\n\nReaders are also cautioned that while the SEC will now recognize 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred mineral resources', it should not be assumed that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of Mineral Resources or into Mineral Reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to assume that any 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' or 'inferred mineral resources' that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, 'inferred mineral resources' have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, readers are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the 'inferred mineral resources' exist. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of 'inferred mineral resources' cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101. For the above reasons, information contained in this MD&A containing descriptions of the Company's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.",

(the 'Company') and all information in this financial report are the responsibility of management. The consolidated financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting Standards  and,  where  appropriate,  include  management's  best  estimates  and  judgments. Management has reviewed the financial information presented throughout this report and has ensured it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss or unauthorized use, and that financial information is timely and reliable. However, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and implemented, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfils its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Audit Committee, and all of its members are independent directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management and the auditors to review internal controls, audit results, accounting principles and related matters. The Board of Directors approves the consolidated financial statements on the recommendation from the Audit Committee.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent firm of Chartered Professional Accountants, was appointed by the shareholders at the last annual meeting to examine the consolidated financial statements and provide an independent professional opinion.

The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The fair value of the acquisition of a subsidiary is based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the fair value of the consideration. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed includes any contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. At the date of acquisition, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values. The Company also recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value.\n\nThe excess, if any, of the consideration paid and the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In the case of a bargain purchase, where the total consideration paid and the non-controlling interest recognized are less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances, revenues and expenses and earnings and losses resulting from inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are a separate component of the Company' s equity. Non-controlling interests consist of the non-controlling interests on the date of the original business combination plus the non-controlling interests ' share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.\n\n## (b) Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are b elieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\nThe significant  areas  of  estimation and/or  judgment considered  by  management  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to:\n\n- x Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates (note 2.2(l)) ;\n- x impairment of non-financial assets (note 2.2(p)) ;\n- x rehabilitation provisions and contingencies (note 2.2(q)) ;\n- x revenue recognition related to toll smelting arrangements (note 2.2(t)) ;and\n- x deferred income tax assets and liabilities (note 2.2(x)) .",

Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> at the exchange rates on the dates that their fair values are determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Income and expense items are translated at the exchange rate on the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of these amounts are included in net earnings (loss), except those arising on the translation of equity instruments that are fair valued through glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nForeign operations are comprised of subsidiaries of the Company that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates on the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates on the dates of the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized as currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive  income glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> (loss).  Accumulated  currency  translation  adjustments  are  reclassified  to  net earnings (loss) upon the disposal of the associated glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> foreign operation when the gain or loss on disposal is recognized. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Prior to the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> sale of MineRP in May 2021, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> MineRP glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> was glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the only foreign operation of the Company with glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> a functional currency being South African Rand ('ZAR') and its subsidiaries with function al currencies glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> denominated in the currencies of the primary economic environments in which each of the subsidiaries glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> operated.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash deposits, guaranteed investment certificates glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> ('GICs') glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and/or other highly rated and liquid securities with an original maturity of less than three months. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> As at December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents comprised of cash at banks of $383.4 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million (December 31, 2021 -$334.4 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million) glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and GICs of $49.8 million (December 31, 2021 -glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $nil).\n\n## (f) Inventories\n\nInventories of ore and concentrates glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> are measured and valued at the lower of average production cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the concentrates in the ordinary course of business glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> based on the prevailing metal prices on the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production and to bring the concentrates to sale. Production costs that are inventoried include the costs directly related to bringing the inventory to its current condition and location, such as materials, labour, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> other direct costs (including external services and depreciation, depletion and amortization), glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> production related glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> overheads and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> royalties.",

Obsolete, redundant and slow moving inventories are identified at each reporting date and written down to their net realizable values. Arsenic calcines not expected to be processed in the next 12 months are classified as long-term inventory and included in other long-term assets.\n\n## (g) Financial assets and liabilities excluding derivative instruments related to hedging activities\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nNon-derivative financial assets are classified and measured as 'financial assets at fair value', as either through profit or loss ('FVPL') or through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI'), and 'financial assets at amortized cost', as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition based on the Company's business model and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at FVPL, directly attributable transaction costs on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial  assets  with  embedded  derivatives  are  considered  in  their  entirety  when  determining  their classification  at  FVPL  or  at  amortized  cost.  The  Company  has  classified  accounts  receivable  on provisionally priced sales as financial assets measured at FVPL. Other accounts receivable held for collection of contractual cash flows are measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Subsequent measurement -Financial assets at FVPL\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVPL include financial assets management intends to sell in the short term and any derivative financial instrument that is not designated as a hedging instrument in a hedge relationship. Financial assets measured at FVPL are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position with changes in fair value recognized in other income and expense in the consolidated statements  of  earnings  (loss). The  Company's  investment  in  Sabina  special  warrants , its  accounts receivable on provisionally priced sales and foreign exchange forward contracts not related to hedging activities are classified as financial assets at FVPL.\n\n## Subsequent measurement -Financial assets at FVOCI\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVOCI are non-derivative financial assets that are not held for trading and the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to measure the assets at FVOCI. The Company's investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as financial assets at FVOCI.\n\nAfter initial measurement, investments measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Subsequent measurement -Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are non-derivative financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent repayments of principal and interest. The Company's other accounts receivable is classified as financial assets at amortized cost.\n\nDividends from all financial assets are recognized in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the right to receive the dividend is established.",

The Company has elected to apply the simplified approach to impairment as permitted by IFRS 9, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Financial Instruments , which requires the expected lifetime loss to be recognized at the time of initial recognition of the receivable. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> To measure estimated credit losses, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, including the number of days past due. An impairment loss glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> is glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> reversed in subsequent periods if the amount of the expected loss decreases and the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the initial impairment was recognized.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVPL as is the case for held for trading or derivative glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> instruments, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> or the Company has opted to measure the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> financial liability glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> at FVPL. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> The Company 's financial liabilities i nclude accounts payable glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and accrued liabilities glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and long-term debt, which are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> with any associated gain or loss recognized glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> in other income and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> expense glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (h) Derivative financial instruments glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOIJ+Arial,Bold> and hedging activities\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the dates glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> they are glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> at the end of each reporting period. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nFor a derivative instrument to qualify for hedge accounting, the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Company glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> a glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> hedging instrument and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedging  transaction.  The  Company  also  documents  its assessment, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative used to glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> hedge glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> an underlying exposure is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item.\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity is more than glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> 12 months.",

For  hedges  of  capital  expenditures, the accumulated fair value change initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) is subsequently included in the carrying value of the underlying assets hedged in the period the underlying hedged capital expenditures occur.\n\nThe time value, which forms a component of these foreign exchange option contracts, is treated as a separate cost of hedging. As a result, any unrealized fair value change in the time value component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts is initially recognized as a deferred cost of hedging in other comprehensive  income  (loss) in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  (loss). The accumulated cost of hedging is subsequently recognized in cost of sales or included in the carrying value of the underlying assets hedged in the period the underlying hedged operating expenses or capital expenditures occur.\n\n## Commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company also designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts to hedge future metal price exposures ('Production Hedges') as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in fair value of the spot component of the swaps are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The accumulated fair value change is subsequently recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the period the underlying hedged sales occur.\n\nThe forward points, or time value, which form a component of these commodity swap contracts, are treated as a separate cost of hedging. As a result, any unrealized fair value change in the time value component of the outstanding commodity swap contracts is initially recognized as a deferred cost of hedging in other comprehensive  income  (loss) in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  (loss).

As a result, any change in the fair value of the forward point component is recognized in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).",

The estimation of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic and geological data and these assumptions and estimates impact the decision to either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances in order to determine if an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information becomes available after expenditures have been capitalized that the recovery of these expenditures is no longer probable, the expenditures capitalized are written down to the recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.\n\n## (l) Mine properties\n\n## Mine Properties -Mines under construction\n\nAll expenditures undertaken in the development, construction, installation and/or completion of mine production facilities are capitalized and initially classified as 'Mines under construction' . All expenditures related to the construction of mine declines and orebody access, including mine shafts and ventilation raises, are considered to be capital development and are capitalized. Expenses incurred after reaching the orebody are regarded as operating development costs and are included in the cost of ore hoisted.\n\nUpon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  all  related  assets  included  in ' Mines  under construction ' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'. Determination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the mine is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The Company considers primarily the following factors, among others, when determining the commencement of commercial production:\n\n- x All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- x A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- x A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- x Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\n\n## Mine Properties -Producing mines\n\nAll assets reclassified from 'Mines under construction' to 'Producing mines' are stated at cost less accumulated depletion and accumulated impairment charges. Costs incurred for the acquisition of land are stated at cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a producing mine comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nWhen a mine construction project moves into production, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases, and from that point on, costs are either regarded as inventory costs or expensed as cost of sales, except for costs related to mine additions or improvements, open pit stripping activities that provide a future benefit, and underground mine development or mineable reserve development, which qualify for capitalization.",

The Company prepares its Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the orebody which is compiled by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are based upon  factors  such  as  metal  prices,  capital  requirements,  production  costs,  foreign  exchange  rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the orebody. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, together with forecast production, determine the life of mine estimates and therefore changes in the Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets (note 2.2(k)) , mine properties, property, plant  and  equipment (note  2.2(m)), depletion  and  depreciation  charges (note  2.2(m)), rehabilitation provisions (note 2.2(q)), and deferred income tax assets (note 2.2(x)).\n\n## (m) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment charges.\n\nThe initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets relating to leases are also included in property, plant and equipment (note 2.2(r)) .\n\n## Depreciation\n\nThe depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to a mine is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit, except in the case of an asset whose estimated useful life is less than the life of the deposit, in which case the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life based on the straight-line method. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is based on the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in a capitalized exploration or development project is capitalized to the project.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, is as follows:\n\n| Asset Category          | Estimated useful life (Years)   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings               | 10 - 20                         |\n| Machinery and Equipment | 3 - 20                          |\n| Vehicles                | 5                               |\n| Computer Hardware       | 2 - 4                           |\n| Office Equipment        | 3 - 10                          |",

These assets are reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and depreciation of these assets commences when they are completed and ready for their intended use.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment, including any significant part initially recognized, is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of all assets are reviewed at each financial year end and are adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of estimated residual values and useful lives. The actual residual values and useful lives may differ from current estimates.\n\nDepreciation of mine specific assets is based on the unit-of-production method. The life of these assets is assessed annually with regard to both their anticipated useful life and the present assessments of the economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property where these assets are located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and resources. Any changes to these calculations based on new information are accounted for prospectively.\n\nRates of depreciation and, in turn, the annual depreciation expense could therefore be materially affected by changes in underlying estimates. Changes in estimates can be the result of differences in actual production or changes in forecast future production, changes in Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves through exploration activities, differences between estimated and actual costs of mining and differences in metal prices used in the estimation of Mineral Reserves.\n\n## Major maintenance and repairs\n\nExpenditures on major maintenance include the cost of replacing part of an asset and overhaul costs. When part of an asset is being replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the replacement or overhauled item will flow to the Company through an extended life, the expenditure is capitalized as a separate asset and the carrying amount of the replaced part is written off.\n\n## (n) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets include software, exploration and software licences and long-term customer contracts.\n\nIntangible assets acquired are measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to the preparation of the asset for its intended use. Identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations are initially recognized at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\n\nResearch expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of an identifiable software product are capitalized and recognized as an intangible asset.\n\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment charges and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.",

A disposal group is a group of assets which the Company intends to dispose of in a single transaction. These assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment charges on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognized in net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. The reversal of any previously recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset held for sale.\n\nAssets and liabilities in a disposal group are classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe measurement of assets held for sale requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and its recoverability through sale. Actual sale proceeds may differ materially from the carrying value.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. The operating results glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and cash flows glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated statements of earnings glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> (loss) and cash flows.\n\n## (p) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the carrying values of mine properties, intangible assets glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment if glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> indicators of potential impairment exist. If any indication of potential impairment exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> ('FVLCD') and its glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> value in use based on glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> discounted glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> cash flows. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> This is determined on glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, individual assets are grouped together into a Cash Generating Uni t ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> of assets. Management has assessed the Company's glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> CGUs glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> as being an individual operating site.",

Impairment charge is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nAn assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any change in events or circumstances relating to a previously recognized impairment. If a change has occurred, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount for the previously impaired asset or CGU. A previously recognized impairment charge is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment charge was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its newly determined recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors for each CGU. External factors include market considerations ranging from overall economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to changes in commodity prices, toll rates, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and regulatory requirements. Internal factors include considerations such as production volume, ability to convert resources into reserves, capital and operating expenditures, and future development and expansion plans.\n\nThese significant estimates and assumptions, some of which may be subjective, require that management make decisions based on the best available information at each reporting period. It is possible that the actual recoverable amount could be significantly different than those estimates. A significant decline in the asset's market value , reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Company's assets. Judgment is also required when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.\n\n## (q) Provisions and contingencies\n\n## General\n\nProvisions are recognized when: a) the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and b) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made for the amount of the obligation. Where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the Company settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax discount rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision as a result of the passage of time is recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA contingent liability is not recognized in the case where no reliable estimate can be made; however, disclosure is required unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. By its nature, a contingent liability will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of a contingent liability inherently involves the exercise of significant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.",

The Company recognizes a liability for its rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the risk free nominal discount rates that are specific to the countries in which the operations are located. A corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated in the same manner as the related asset.\n\nThe nature of these restoration and rehabilitation activities includes: i) dismantling and removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. Other environmental costs incurred  at  the  operating  sites,  such  as  environmental  monitoring,  water  management  and  waste management costs, are charged to profit or loss when incurred.\n\nThe liability is accreted over time to its expected future settlement value. The accretion expense is recognized in finance costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nThe Company assesses its rehabilitation provisions at each reporting date. The rehabilitation liability and related assets are adjusted at each reporting date for changes in the discount rates and in the estimated amount, timing and cost of the work to be carried out. Any reduction in the rehabilitation liability and therefore any deduction in the related rehabilitation asset may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is immediately credited to profit or loss.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made by management in determining the nature and costs associated with the rehabilitation liability. The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the timing, extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technology changes, regulatory changes, and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.\n\n## (r) Leases\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the agreement on the inception date.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company recognizes a lease obligation and a right-of-use asset in the consolidated statements of financial position on a present-value basis at the date when the leased asset is available for use. Each lease payment is apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the lease obligation. Finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The right-of-use asset is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nLease obligations are initially measured at the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- x fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- x variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- x amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees;\n- x the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- x payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if this rate cannot glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> be determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate.",

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise primarily small equipment.\n\n## (s) Share capital\n\nCommon shares issued by DPM are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are recognized in equity as a deduction from the share proceeds. Costs to repurchase and cancel the C ompany's shares are recognized as a reduction in share capital to the extent of its book value. The excess of the purchase price over the book value is recognized as a reduction in contributed surplus to the extent of available surplus and any further excess is recognized as a reduction in retained earnings in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity .\n\n## (t) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrates containing gold, copper and silver is recognized when control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when products have been delivered and the significant risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract.\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrates is initially recorded based on a provisional value which is a function of prevailing market prices, estimated weights and grades less smelter and other commercial deductions. Under the terms of the concentrate sales contracts, the final metal price for the payable metal is based on a predetermined quotational period of London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market daily prices. The price of the concentrate is the sum of the metal payments less the sum of specified deductions, including treatment and refining charges, penalties for deleterious elements, and freight. The terms of these contracts result in embedded derivatives because of the timing difference between the prevailing metal prices for provisional payments and the actual contractual metal prices used for final settlement. These embedded derivatives are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through to the date of final price determination with any adjustments recognized in revenue.\n\nAny adjustments to the amount receivable for each shipment on the settlement date, caused by final assay results, are adjusted through revenue at the time of determination.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrates is recognized when the concentrate has been smelted and is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed and prevailing market conditions at the time the agreement was entered. Under each toll agreement, Tsumeb incurs a carrying charge in respect of the concentrate it processes until blister copper is delivered. This carrying charge is recorded as a reduction of revenue.",

('IXM') . These adjustments represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage accountable glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> in the IXM contract to (ii) the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> accountable glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the incircuit material still being processed by Tsumeb. Many aspects glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> of the metal exposure are subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.\n\nRevenue from the sale of sulphuric acid, a by-product from processing concentrate at the Tsumeb smelter, is measured at the price specified in the sales contract and is recognized when the control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the products have been delivered to the location specified in the sales contract and the risk of loss has been transferred to the buyer.\n\nPrior to the sale of MineRP in May 2021, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> r evenue from MineRP's software services was recognized over time when the services were rendered. This was measured based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The estimated revenue or extent of progress toward percentage of completion was revised if changes occurred glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> or circumstances arose that indicated glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> a revision was glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> warranted. Any resulting increase or decrease in estimated revenue was reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the period in which such determination was made.\n\nPrior to the sale of MineRP in May 2021, revenue from licences entered into by MineRP containing software and ongoing services elements was glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> recognized based on the estimated fair value of each element. The fair value of each element was glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> determined based on the market price of each element when sold separately. Revenue relating to the software element was glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> recognized when the control had glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> been transferred to the customer, which occurred glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> on delivery. Revenue relating to the service element was recognized over time glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> when the services were rendered.\n\n## (u) Deferred revenue\n\nDeferred  revenue glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  when  a  cash glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> prepayment is received from one or more customers prior to the sale of product or delivery of service. Revenue is subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the sale occurs, which generally occurs when control has been transferred or in the case of services, when the services have been rendered.\n\nThe Company recognizes glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the time value of money, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> where there is a significant financing component and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the period between the payment by the customer and the transfer of the contracted glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> goods or services exceeds one year.\n\n## (v) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly related glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> to the acquisition glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and the construction of a qualifying capital asset glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> are glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> capitalized and added to the cost of the asset glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> until such time as the asset is glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> considered substantially ready for its glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> intended use. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalized represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalized is calculated using the weighted average cost glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Company glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.",

Stock options vest equally over a three-year period and expire five years from the date of grant. Grants of stock options are based on the fiveday volume weighted average price ('Market Price') of DPM's common shares on the TSX the day before the effective grant date and reflect the Company's estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. Stock options are measured on the date of grant by reference to the fair value determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, further details of which are given in note 18 .The value is recognized as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and an increas e to contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nA Director Deferred Share Unit (' Director DSU') Plan and an Employee Deferred Share Unit ('Employee DSU') Plan were established for directors and certain employees in lieu of cash compensation. The Director DSUs are paid in cash following separation of a director from the Company based on the closing price of DPM's common shares on the applicable redemption date as elected by the director. The Employee DSUs are paid in cash based on (i) the Market Price of DPM's common shares on the date the employee ceases to be employed by DPM or a subsidiary thereof ('Separation Date'); or (ii) if a deferred redemption date has been elected by the employee ('Deferred Redemption Date') , a cash payment by the Company to the employee based on the Market Price or the closing price of DPM's common shares on the day preceding the Deferred Redemption Date; or (iii) the Market Price of DPM's common shares if the Deferred Redemption Date is December 15 of the calendar year commencing after the Separation Date. The cost of the DSUs is measured initially at fair value ba sed on the closing price of DPM's common shares preceding the day the DSUs are granted. The cost of the DSUs is recognized as a liability under share based compensation plans in the consolidated statements of financial position and as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The liability is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA  Share  Unit  ('SU') Plan  was  established  for  directors, certain  employees and  eligible  contractors ('Participant') of DPM and its wholly -owned subsidiaries in consideration of past services to the Company.\n\nUnder this plan, the Board of Directors may, at its sole discretion, (i) grant non-performance based SUs, referred to as restricted share units ('RSUs') and SUs with a performance-based component, referred to as performance share units ('PSUs'), subject to performance conditions to be achieved by the Company; and (ii) determine the entitlement date or dates of such RSUs and PSUs. Non-performance based RSUs vest equally over a threeyear period and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's publicly traded common shares on the entitlement date or dates. PSUs vest after three years from the grant date and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares, subject to performance criteria established by the Board of Directors on the entitlement date or dates.",

The cost of RSUs and PSUs is recognized as a liability under share based compensation plans, with the current portion recognized in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, in the consolidated statements of financial position and as an expense  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  (loss)  over  the  vesting  period.  The  liability  is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares and, in the case of PSUs, subject to performance criteria, at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (x) Income taxes\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on the taxable loss or income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences on the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe following temporary differences do not result in deferred income tax assets or liabilities:\n\n- x The initial recognition of assets or liabilities, not arising from a business combination, that does not affect accounting or taxable profit;\n- x Initial recognition of goodwill, if any; and\n- x Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and reversal in the foreseeable future is not probable.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable income will be generated to allow the deferred income tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> period glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> when the asset is expected to be realized or the liability is expected to be settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.",

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nJudgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  the consolidated statements of financial position. Deferred income tax assets, including those arising from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred income tax assets recorded on the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## (y) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if additional common shares are assumed to be issued under securities that entitle their holders to obtain common shares in the future. The number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted earnings per share is determined using the treasury stock method, whereby stock options and warrants, whose exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's common shares, are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period with proceeds based on the average market price for the period. The incremental number of common shares issued under stock options and warrants is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## 2.3    NEW IFRS AMENDMENT ADOPTED\n\nThe Company adopted amendment to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment , effective for financial reporting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2022. This amendment prohibits deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss, and must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the entity's ordinary activities. This amendment had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

TSUMEB IMPAIRMENT CHARGE\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of each of its CGUs glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> as a result of (i) the market capitalization of DPM's shares being less than their carrying value ; and (ii) a decrease in the expected supply of suitable higher arsenic bearing concentrate for processing at the smelter over the longer term. Based on this assessment, the carrying values of all CGUs were considered recoverable, with the exception of Tsumeb.\n\nAs a result of the impairment assessment, the carrying value of Tsumeb exceeded its estimated recoverable amount resulting in an impairment charge of $85.0 million being recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> for the year glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> ended December 31, 2022, of which $84.3 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million related to property, plant, and equipment and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $0.7 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million related to intangible assets. This charge was primarily attributable to lower forecast toll revenue as a result of an glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> expected reduction in higher arsenic bearing third party concentrate glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> feed being received by the smelter commencing in 2024, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> concurrent with when the smelter is not expected to be glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> processing any of glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Chelopech concentrate. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> While the processing of Chelopech concentrate at other third party smelters glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> is expected to generate additional overall value for the Company, it will be realized glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> through lower treatment charges and higher margins at Chelopech rather than higher tolling rates glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and higher margins at Tsumeb.\n\nTsumeb's recoverable amount of $40.0 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million was determined using FVLCD, which was calculated based on projected future cash flows utilizing the latest information available and management's estimates including throughput ranging from 230,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes, toll rates and volumes based on historical  terms  received  and  the  Company's  knowledge  of  the  complex  concentrate  market,  lower operating costs, sustaining capital expenditures in line with current levels, and the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the ZAR glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> of 17.05. These projected cash flows were prepared in current dollars and discounted using a real discount rate of 10.79%, representing the estimated weighted average real cost of capital. This rate was estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model where the costs of equity and debt were based on, among other things, estimated interest rates, market returns on equity, share volatility, leverage and risks specific to the mining sector and Tsumeb. Management's estimate of Tsumeb's FVLCD is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe projected cash flows and FVLCD glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> for Tsumeb can be affected by any one or more changes in the estimates used. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Changes in third party toll rates, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> operating costs, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> foreign exchange rates and volumes of concentrate smelted glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> have glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> the greatest impact on value, where glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> a 5% change in any one glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> of above assumptions would each change the FVLCD by approximately $30 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million to $35 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> as at December 31, 2022. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> In addition, if Tsumeb does glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> not achieve forecasted glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> operating levels and future cost savings in respect of glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> its glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> initiative to optimize the cost structure of the smelter, there could be a further impairment charge.",

As at December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding Production Hedges.\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges as cash flow hedges and the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges as fair value hedges.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on commodity swap contracts is calculated based on the corresponding London Metal Exchange forward copper prices and New York Commodity Exchange forward gold prices, as applicable. As at December 31, 2022, the net fair value loss on all outstanding QP hedges was $3.2 million (December 31, 2021 -$1.9 million), of which $0.1 million (December 31, 2021 -$0.02 million) was included in other current assets and $3.3 million (December 31, 2021 -$1.9 million) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nAll QP hedges are subject to master netting agreements. As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no set-off of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized, in revenue, net gains of $6.8 million (2021 -net losses of $3.5 million) on QP Hedges and realized losses of $nil (2021 -$15.7 million) on Production Hedges.\n\n## (d) Foreign exchange option contracts\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange option contracts from time to time to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange option contracts are entered to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' rate and participation up to a specified 'ceiling' rate. The option contract s entered are comprised of a series of call options and put options (which when combined create a price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in respect of a portion of its projected Namibian dollar denominated operating expenses which are linked to the ZAR as summarized in the table below:\n\n| Year of projected   | Amount hedged   | Call options sold  Weighted average   | Put options purchased  Weighted average   |\n|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| operating expenses  | in ZAR  (i)     | ceiling rate US$/ZAR                  | floor rate US$/ZAR                        |\n| 2023                | 1,378,176,000   | 17.69                                 | 15.69                                     |",

The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on these outstanding contracts was calculated based on foreign exchange forward rates quoted in the market. As at December 31, 2022, the net fair value loss on all outstanding foreign exchange option contracts was $1.8 million (December 31, 2021 -$1.5 million), which was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. All foreign exchange option contracts are subject to master netting agreements. As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no set-off of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe Company recognized realized losses of $1.1 million (2021 -realized gains of $6.5 million) for the year ended December 31, 2022 in cost of sales on the spot component of settled contracts.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized unrealized losses of $0.4 million (2021 -$5.4 million) in other comprehensive income (loss) on the spot component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company also recognized unrealized gains of $0.1 million (2021 -unrealized losses of $2.5 million) on the time value component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) as a deferred cost of hedging.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged items (the  Company's  accounts  receivable  on  provisionally  priced  sales,  projected  payable  metal production, and projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies) and  the  hedging  instruments (commodity  swap  contracts  and  foreign  exchange  forward  and  option contracts). The hedges are effective when the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the critical terms of the hedged item.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- x Differences in the timing and/or amount of the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and\n- x Fair value movements related to counterparty credit risk, which impact the hedging instrument and the hedged item differently.\n\nThe Company 's hedging relationships are such that the ratio between the underlying hedged item and the hedging instrument is 1:1. To measure for potential hedge ineffectiveness, the Company compares change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.",

DEBT\n\n## (a) DPM Revolving Credit Facility\n\nUp to July 2022, DPM had a committed revolving credit facility of $150.0 million with a consortium of banks that was to mature in February 2024. In July 2022, DPM replaced this facility glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> with a new committed revolving credit facility (the 'RCF') with a consortium of four banks that matures in July 2026. Generally speaking, this facility contains more favourable terms and conditions than the old RCF, providing added flexibility, an extende d term, and lower pricing, and is secured by pledges of DPM's investments in Ada Tepe, Chelopech and Loma Larga and by guarantees from each of the subsidiaries that hold these assets and by certain holding companies. Initially, DPM is permitted to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million, which can be increased pursuant to an accordion feature that permits, subject to certain conditions, the facility to be increased to $250.0 million. The cost of borrowing is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), the general replacement rate for LIBOR, plus a spread, which is currently 2.25%, and can range between 2.25% and 3.50 % depending upon DPM's leverage. The RCF contains financial covenants that require DPM to maintain: (i) a Debt Leverage Ratio below 3.75:1, and (ii) a minimum net worth equal to $600 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> plus (minus) 50% of ongoing net earnings (loss) plus 50% of all equity raised by DPM, in each case, after March 31, 2022, and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> as defined under the RCF.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and 2021, DPM was in compliance with all financial covenants and $nil was drawn under the RCF.\n\n## (b) Tsumeb overdraft facility\n\nTsumeb has a Namibian $100.0 million ($5.9 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million) glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> demand overdraft facility. This facility glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> is guaranteed by DPM and bears interest at a rate equal to the Namibian Prime Lending Rate minus 0.5%. As at December 31, 2022 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and 2021, $nil glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> was drawn from this facility.\n\n## (c) Other credit agreements and guarantees\n\nChelopech and Ada Tepe have a $21.0 million multi-purpose credit facility that matures on November 30, 2023 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and is guaranteed by DPM. As at December 31, 2022, $17.3 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million (December 31, 2021 -glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $13.9 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of credit and letters of guarantee, primarily in respect of concession contracts with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy.\n\nChelopech and Ada Tepe also have a Euro 21.0 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million ($22.5 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million) credit facility to support mine closure and rehabilitation obligations glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> in respect of concession contracts with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> This credit facility matures on November 30, 2023 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and is guaranteed by DPM. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> As at December 31, 2022, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $22.5 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million (December 31, 2021 -glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $23.8 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of guarantee.\n\nAda Tepe also has a $10.3 million multi-purpose credit facility that matures on November 30, 2023 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and is guaranteed by DPM. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> As at December 31, 2022, $0.2 glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> million (December 31, 2021 -glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> $0.2 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of credit and letters of guarantee, primarily in respect of exploration contracts with the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy.\n\nAdvances under these facilities bear interest at a rate equal to the one month SOFR glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> plus 2.5%.

LEASES\n\nThe Company leases various property, equipment and vehicles with lease terms ranging between one to 15 years. Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Company. These terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts, the majority of which are exercisable jointly by both the Company and the respective lessor. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.

COMMITMENTS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\n## (a) Commitments\n\nThe Company had the following minimum contractual commitments as at December 31, 2022:\n\n|                      | up to 1 year   | 1 - 5 years   | Total   |\n|----------------------|----------------|---------------|---------|\n| Capital commitments  | 17,348         | -             | 17,348  |\n| Purchase commitments | 21,077         | 95            | 21,172  |\n| Total commitments    | 38,425         | 95            | 38,520  |\n\n## Tsumeb secondary materials\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, Tsumeb had approximately $36.8 million (December 31, 2021 -$73.8 million) of recoverable third party in-process secondary materials, which it is obligated to process and return, generally in the form of blister, to IXM pursuant to a tolling agreement.\n\nIn April 2021, the Company and IXM agreed to amend the existing tolling agreement to provide for, among other things: i) targeted declining excess secondary material balances, above which excess secondary material would be required to be purchased by the Company; ii) the elimination of all excess secondary material by March 31, 2023; iii) an increase in the defined level of normal secondary material; and iv) an extension of the tolling agreement by three years to December 31, 2026.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the value of excess secondary materials, as defined in the tolling agreement, was approximately $3.3 million, which was below the targeted excess secondary material balance under the tolling agreement as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## (b) Contingencies\n\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, from time to time, arising in the ordinary course of its business. It is not expected that any material liability will arise from current legal proceedings or have a material adverse effect on the Company's future business , operations or financial condition.\n\n## 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company 's principal financial liabilities glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> comprise accounts payable glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and accrued liabilities glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and longterm debt. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to assist with the management of the Company's short term and long term cash flow requirements. The Company glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> has various financial assets, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> such as cash glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> accounts receivable, glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main risks that could adversely affect the Company 's financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> market risk (which includes commodity price risk, interest rate risk glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> and glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> foreign currency risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Management reviews each of these risks and establishes glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> policies for managing them as glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> summarized below.\n\nThe following discussion also includes a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Company 's financial instruments and the impact on net earnings (loss) and shareholders' equity, where applicable. Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash, accounts receivable, investments at fair value, commodity swap contracts, foreign exchange option contracts, long-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The sensitivity has been prepared using financial assets and liabilities held as at the reporting dates.",

Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company 's activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees involved in financial risk management activities understand their roles and obligations.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the future cash flows or the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk is comprised of three types of risks: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The impact of each of these components is discussed below.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company is subject to price risk associated with fluctuations in the market prices for metals. The Company sells its products at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on the London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market. The prices of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company regularly enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of its concentrate sales. In addition, the Company periodically enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with projected payable copper production.\n\nThe  Company's  risk  management  policy ,  which  was approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  requires provisional concentrate sales to be fully hedged and permits hedging up to 90%, 85% and 80% of its projected payable copper production in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 , the impact of a 5% increase or decrease in metal prices impacting the Company's accounts receivable and outstanding commodity swap contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease or increase earnings before income taxes by $0.6 million (2021 -$2.0 million) and would decrease or increase equity by $0.6 million (2021 -$2.0 million).\n\nThe following table demonstrates the effect on 2022 and 2021 earnings before income taxes of a 5% increase in commodity prices on its sales, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings.\n\n## Effect of a 5% increase in metal prices on earnings before income taxes\n\n|                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gold                                           | 21,911 | 25,129 |\n| Copper                                         | 5,487  | 6,883  |\n| Total increase on earnings before income taxes | 27,398 | 32,012 |\n\nThe effect of a 5% decrease in metal prices, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant, would decrease earnings before income taxes by an equivalent amount.",

The Company 's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company 's cash and floating rate denominated debt and other financial liabilities. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had no debt or floating rate denominated financial liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across the yield curve, with all other variables held constant, would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes by $4.3 million (2021 -$3.4 million). The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company 's foreign currency exposures arise primarily from a significant portion of its operating and capital costs being denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company's functional currency. The  Company  periodically  undertakes  to  purchase,  in  advance,  a  portion  of  its  foreign denominated cash flow requirements on a spot or forward basis to reduce this exposure. The Company also enters into foreign exchange option contracts in order to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe Company's risk management policy , which was approved by the Board of Directors, permits up to 85%, 80% and 75% of its projected operating expenses denominated in foreign currency to be hedged in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively. The policy also permits projected capital expenditures denominated in foreign currency to be fully hedged.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease equity by $0.8 million (2021 -$1.9 million). The effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would have no impact on equity.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the effect on 2022 and 2021 earnings before income taxes and equity of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Company's key foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant.\n\nEffect of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar on\n\n|                 | Earnings before income taxes   | Earnings before income taxes   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|----------|\n|                 | 2022                           | 2021                           | 2022     | 2021     |\n| Euro            | 2,091                          | 1,731                          | 1,822    | 1,521    |\n| Namibian Dollar | (381)                          | (353)                          | (381)    | (353)    |\n| Canadian Dollar | (1,082)                        | (773)                          | 946      | 1,335    |\n| Total increase  | 628                            | 605                            | 2,388    | 2,504    |\n\nThe effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding foreign denominated financial assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes and equity by equivalent amounts.",

During 2022, the Company had contracts with 19 customers in connection with its mining and smelting operations, one of whom accounted for approximately 40% (2021 -40 %) of the Company's revenue. Under the terms of the Company's concentrate sales contracts, the purchasers make an initial advance payment equal to 70% to 100% of the provisional value of each lot at the time title transfers. This serves to mitigate a porti on of the Company's credit risk.\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash, equity investments and derivative financial assets, the Company 's maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The Company limits its counterparty credit risk on these assets by dealing with highly rated counterparties, issuers that are subject to minimum credit ratings, and/or maximum prescribed exposures.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Company relies on the cash flows generated from its operations, including provisional payments received from its customers, retained cash balances, available lines of credit under its RCF and its ability to raise debt and equity from the capital markets to fund its operating, investment and liquidity needs. The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses and the volatility of capital markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating capability, its ability to maintain, or draw upon, its RCF or the existing terms under its concentrate sales and/or smelting agreements, as well as its liquidity, cost of capital and its ability to access new capital , which could adversely affect the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in turn, could affect total shareholder returns. To reduce these risks, the Company: (i) prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity and compliance to debt covenants; (ii) strives to maintain a prudent capital structure that is comprised primarily of equity financing and long-term debt, currently in the form of a committed RCF; and (iii) targets a minimum level of liquidity comprised of surplus cash balances and/or undrawn committed lines of credit to avoid having to raise additional capital at times when the costs or terms would be regarded as unfavourable.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company 's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                                          |              | As at December 31, 2022   | As at December 31, 2022   | As at December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                          | up to 1 year |                           | 1 - 5 years over 5 years  | Total                     |\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 81,165       | -                         | -                         | 81,165                    |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 3,259        | -                         | -                         | 3,259                     |\n| Foreign exchange option contracts        | 1,787        | -                         | -                         | 1,787                     |\n| Foreign exchange forward contracts       | 318          | -                         | -                         | 318                       |\n| Lease obligations                        | 5,416        | 9,854                     | 1,403                     | 16,673                    |\n| Other obligations                        | 127          | 1,567                     | 486                       | 2,180                     |\n|                                          | 92,072       | 11,421                    | 1,889                     | 105,382                   |\n\n|                                          |              | As at December 31, 2021   | As at December 31, 2021   | As at December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                          | up to 1 year | 1 - 5 years               | over 5 years              | Total                     |\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 73,735       | -                         | -                         | 73,735                    |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 1,946        | -                         | -                         | 1,946                     |\n| Foreign exchange option contracts        | 1,489        | -                         | -                         | 1,489                     |\n| Lease obligations                        | 5,407        | 10,305                    | 1,791                     | 17,503                    |\n| Other obligations                        | 700          | 840                       | 125                       | 1,665                     |\n|                                          | 83,277       | 11,145                    | 1,916                     | 96,338                    |",

See note 14 for discussion on the Company's compliance with these requirements. The Company monitors its financial position and the potential impact of adverse market conditions on an ongoing basis. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it based on prevailing market conditions and according to its business strategy. The Company's long term funding strategy is to maintain a capital structure comprised primarily of equity sourced from equity offerings and net earnings generated from its businesses and, as a result, the targeted level of debt making up the Company's capital base is relatively low. Given the long term nature of the assets being funded and the U.S. dollar denominated revenue stream generated therefrom, the Company 's general strategy around any debt financing is to raise long-term U.S. dollar denominated debt to supplement these equity financings.\n\nOverall financial leverage is monitored based upon a number of non-financial and financial factors, including a number of credit related ratios contained in DPM's loan agreements and net debt (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a percentage of total capital (defined as total equity plus net debt). As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants and its net debt as a percentage of total capital was negative 77% (December 31, 2021 -negative 50%).\n\n## 29. OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nOperating segments are components of an entity whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance and for which separate financial information is available.\n\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments -glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Chelopech and Ada Tepe in Bulgaria and Tsumeb in Namibia. The nature of their operations, products and services are described in note 1 , glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> Corporate  Information .  These  segments  are  organized  predominantly glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> by  the  products  and  services provided to customers and geography of the businesses. The Corporate and Other segment includes corporate, exploration and evaluation and other income and cost items that do not pertain directly to an operating segment. There are no significant inter-segment transactions that have not been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe operating results of MineRP have been presented as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the MineRP Disposition (note glyph<c=3,font=/BGDANC+Arial,Italic> 4) .\n\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note 2.2, Significant Accounting  Policies .  Segment  performance  is  evaluated  based  on  several  operating  and  financial measures, including net earnings (loss), which is measured glyph<c=3,font=/BGCOEH+Arial> consistently with net earnings (loss) in the consolidated financial statements.",
