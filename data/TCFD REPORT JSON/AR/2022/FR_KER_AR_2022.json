As well as ensuring that strategic decisions are taken and implemented effectively, it ensures a genuine balance of powers.\n\n## Unified governance, well suited to Kering's specific features\n\nKering  has  opted  to  combine  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the Board  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  taking  the  view  that  this governance arrangement is the one that best suits the Group's specific features, in which each of its Houses have autonomy. The arrangement takes into account Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's special  position  as  controlling  shareholder  and  his  active involvement  in  conducting  the  Group's  business  affairs,  of which he has in-depth operational knowledge. The Chairman and CEO is supported by a Group Managing Director, who helps develop  Kering's  strategy,  manages  its  implementation  and focuses on enhancing the Group's operational efficiency.\n\n## The Lead Independent Director: ensuring the balance of powers within the governance structure and the smooth running of the Board\n\nWith  a  view  to  achieving  a  genuine  balance  of  power  on  its Board, the Group takes steps to ensure that its membership is balanced, diverse and mostly independent.\n\nIn addition, given that the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are combined and to provide additional assurance with regard to the Board's smooth running, in 2019 the  Board  of  Directors  created  the  role  of  Lead  Independent Director.\n\n- 18\n\nThe Lead Independent Director is consulted on the schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to  the  Chairman.  He/she  liaises  between  the  independent directors,  other  Board  members  and  Executive  Management, and helps prevent conflicts of interest from occurring. He/she monitors compliance with the Board's internal rules and takes part  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  Board  of  Directors.  In coordination  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Lead Independent Director also represents the Board in its dealings with investors concerning environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nThe  duties  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director  are  detailed  in section 1.5 of Chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Climate Change Lead: ensuring that climate issues are taken into account by the Board\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  commitments  in  terms  of  climate action, the role of Climate Change Lead was created within the Board of Directors in 2022.\n\nIn coordination with the Chair of the Sustainability Committee and the Lead Independent Director, the Climate Change Lead's role  includes  ensuring  that  climate  issues  are  taken  into account by the Board and that they are factored into all of the Group's decisions.\n\nFinally, the Climate Change Lead reports to the Board at least twice a year on the deployment of the Climate Strategy within the  Group  and  on  the  implementation  and  results  of  the climate change mitigation and adaptation action plans.\n\nThe duties of the Climate Change Lead are detailed in section 1.6 of Chapter 3 of this Document.",

These changes are shaking up the rules of the luxury industry.\n\nKering is setting the trend, purposefully shaping the luxury of tomorrow, which will be more responsible and more in tune with our times and with the future, while remaining true to the exceptional history and heritage of its Houses.\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  be  the  world's  most  influential  Luxury group  in  terms  of  creativity,  sustainability  and  economic performance.\n\n## Creativity and innovation, while respecting heritage\n\nConsumers have new expectations. It remains vital to preserve heritage and offer high-end expertise, but this is not enough. Consumers  today  want  to  express  their  unique  individuality, and our vision of Luxury supports this radical shift. We dare to take risks, think differently, and constantly propose fresh and innovative ideas that inspire emotion and enthusiasm for our exceptional  products,  as  well  as  allowing  all  customers  to express their distinctive personality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our business model\n\n## A multi-brand model built on a long-term approach and creative autonomy for our Houses\n\nKering is a global luxury group, managing the development of a  series  of  renowned  Houses  in  fashion,  leather  goods  and jewelry:  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Alexander McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Brioni,  Boucheron,  Pomellato,  DoDo, Qeelin, and Kering Eyewear.\n\nThanks  to  our  international  footprint  and  the  strength  of  our Houses combined with the creative autonomy they enjoy and the unique  quality  of  our  creations,  Kering  is  among  the  foremost players  in  the  luxury  goods  market.  Our  model  fosters  rapid growth for our brands and creates the space for them to thrive.\n\n\"Our multi-brand approach is built on a long-term vision and combines agility, balance and responsibility\"\n\n## AGILITY\n\n## Kering provides its Houses with an organizational structure that unlocks their potential for excellence\n\n## \u00b7 Continuity\n\nKering  began  as  a  family  company  60  years  ago  and  is  now controlled  by  Artemis,  a  holding  company  owned  by  the Pinault family. With this strong and stable shareholder, Kering boasts  an  attractive  and  sustainable  profile  conducive  to developing its vision in the luxury goods market over the long term.\n\n## \u00b7 Transformation\n\nFrom  a  conglomerate  of  diversified  retail  activities  until  the early 2000s, Kering has transformed itself into a Luxury group focusing on personal goods. We are now an integrated group bringing  together  and  developing  some  of  the  world's  most prestigious Houses. Through the years, we have been able to leverage the most effective growth drivers.\n\n## \u00b7 Clarity\n\nKering helps its Houses realize their full growth potential. At each stage of their development, they benefit from innovative logistics platforms, digital services and technological infrastructure,  and  shared  support  functions.  By  encouraging imagination in all its forms, our organization promotes strict management while enabling our Houses to unleash the best of  their  talent  and  creativity.  The  Group  ensures  that  the brands'  success  is  aligned  with  their  long-term  visions  and objectives. Thanks to our curiosity, capacity for self-reflection and big-picture thinking, we can achieve the clarity necessary to set a successful course for the Group and its Houses.\n\nWhat Kering and its Houses propose is an experience. Our values are  closely  related  to  the  powerful  creative  content  of  our products, which imbues them with modernity. Those values are complemented by the entrepreneurial spirit that permeates each of  our  brands and by the vision of our creative teams. Kering is made  up  of  women  and  men  who  strive  each  day  to  create authentic, ever-changing, engaged and inclusive Luxury.\n\n## Kering = Caring\n\nWe  want  to  play  our  part  in  the  emergence  of  a  more environmentally friendly world. We are constantly raising our creative  and  production  standards  to  ensure  respect  for  the planet while at the same time having positive social impacts. We aim to create value that is equitably distributed among all our stakeholders.\n\nKering  is  pronounced  'caring',  which  is  much  more  than  a simple allusion: it gives meaning to everything we do.\n\n## Strong business performance\n\nKering is a Group focused exclusively on luxury. It has several Houses that have achieved critical mass in the luxury industry, along with some jewels of the future. These two characteristics  make it  one  of  the  most  profitable  and  cashgenerative groups in its sector.",

Following our successful transformation into a leading luxury  goods  player,  we  boast  some  of  the  industry's  most prestigious  Houses.  Our  brands  complement  each  other  well with their distinctive market positions, and each play a role in a coherent ensemble.\n\n## \u00b7 A multi-brand model\n\nWe  use  our  strength  as  a  Group  to  help  forge  a  distinctive identity for each House. Our brands find ways to express their unique characters. The Group supports the brands by providing expertise,  exercising  its  power  as  a  group  to  exert  influence, improving  supply  chain  reliability  and  opening  up  access  to distribution  networks,  as  well  as  enhancing  the  client  experience, especially in digital channels. It also encourages the Houses to share best practice with a view to driving innovation.\n\n\"Our economic model is built on exceptional Houses, complementary market positions and varying maturity profiles\"\n\n## RESPONSIBILITY\n\nAll our operations are founded on a responsible economic model.\n\nOur comprehensive, sustainable approach is a structural competitive advantage.\n\n## \u00b7 Toward sustainable luxury\n\nCan a responsible economic approach change the very nature of luxury? For Kering, the answer is a resounding \"yes'. For our Houses,  sustainability  is  in  line  with  our  vision  of  modern luxury.  Businesses  have  an  ethical  obligation  to  be  more responsible, reflecting society's new expectations. This situation can also be viewed as an opportunity to grow, and is a source of  inspiration  and  innovation.  Methods,  materials,  resources and products are being reinvented, and customer usage and expectations  are  changing.  Kering  is  changing  the  way  it designs  luxury  products  by  incorporating  the  criterion  of sustainable value, for our customers as well as for society. The targets identified to improve the Group's social and environmental performance are set out in our 2025 sustainability strategy.\n\n## \u00b7 An inclusive approach\n\nThe  aim  of  the  responsible  model  is  to  rethink  Kering's relationships  with  its  stakeholders  to  ensure  fairness  and responsibility. Affecting all dimensions of Kering's eco-system, from the Group's strategy and the Houses' creative decisions to operational production, processing and distribution choices, the model  aims  to  reduce the social and environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's  operations.  Placing people  at  the  heart  of  the  model  brings  an  entrepreneurial spirit, engaging employees and stakeholders.\n\n## \u00b7 Creative potential\n\nResponsibility is deeply embedded in the Group's organizational structure  and  promotes  business  growth  through  ever  more innovative  and  attractive  products.  It  rewards  best  business practices such as firm cost control and process upgrading. In a context of limited natural resources, new  high-quality materials are being fashioned and more sustainable processes devised. We are constantly on the look-out for innovative and disruptive technologies. For our brands, this represents a vast swathe of creative territory yet to be explored.\n\n## \u00b7 Governance and ethics\n\nBuilt  on  the  Group's  core  values,  Kering's  responsible  model leverages  an  ambitious  governance  structure,  supported  by the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  Sustainability  Committee. Together  they  drive  the  sustainability  strategy,  which  the Houses  put  into  action  every  day  under  the  guidance  of dedicated experts. The Group's Ethics Committees, Compliance structure  and  whistleblowing  procedure  for  employees  and third parties ensure that Kering's Code of Ethics and principles for responsible business conduct are properly applied.\n\n\"Being a responsible Luxury group means crafting the Luxury of tomorrow - we perceive change as an opportunity and a positive prospect for our growth\"\n\n## \u00b7 An ensemble of complementary Houses\n\nWhile  our  most  firmly  established  Houses  are  reinventing themselves  and  engaging  with  their  audiences  in  new  ways, our other brands are focused on realizing their full potential and gaining new clients. As a result, due to the variety of its customers,  products,  brands  and  locations,  Kering  is  well placed  to  weather  changes  in  market  conditions  and  seize growth opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the coming years, the Group will continue to strengthen and sustain its growth momentum.\n\n## Promoting organic growth\n\n## \u00b7 Increasing market share in an industry set to deliver growth in the medium and long term\n\nThe future of the luxury goods market is fundamentally bright. The growth of emerging economies, the development of new audiences  that  are  culturally  open  to  global  brands  and  the increasing use of new technologies are major sources of value creation for Kering. The challenge for each of our Houses is to outperform its respective market.\n\n## \u00b7 Creativity at our core\n\nEnergized  by  their  creative  teams,  our  Houses  are  setting trends.  Backed  by  the  Group,  they  are  constantly  coming  up with fresh ideas and creations that appeal to their customers' desire, inspire their dreams and tap into their emotions. The Group's Houses take a timeless approach to creativity. We are proud of our past icons, which form part of our Houses' history while  remaining  entirely  relevant  today,  with  their  influence visible in our most recent innovations and events.\n\n## \u00b7 Achieving excellence in terms of the customer experience\n\nOffering high quality products and customer experience through our distribution network is vital. Supporting customers before, during and after sales are made -  in  stores  or  online  -  is  what  enables  our  Houses  to  create and  sustain  lasting  connections.  A  personalized  customer experience  helps  make  each  client  interaction  unique.  The decisions  to  have  in-house  customer  relations  and  ecommerce  platforms,  to  speed  up  the  development  of distance selling tools and to increase the proportion of sales coming from retail stores we control, were guided by the same aim.\n\n## \u00b7 Sales efficiency\n\nOur  Houses  generated  78%  of  their  revenue  from  their  own distribution networks (stores and e-commerce sites) in 2022. By  having  greater  control  over  our  own  distribution,  we  can provide the best possible customer service. Our brands deploy initiatives to boost  sales  performance,  capitalizing  on increasingly effective merchandizing and in-store operational excellence, supported by the Group and its dedicated teams. Optimizing same-store sales performance on an ongoing basis is a key organic growth driver for Kering.\n\n## \u00b7 Omnichannel approach\n\nOur customers are connected and mobile, constantly moving between distribution channels, from digital platforms to brickand-mortar  stores  and  vice-versa.  Our  customer  relations strategy is epitomized by continuity across all communication and distribution channels. This holistic omnichannel approach is  supported by the directly operated store network, which is being  selectively  extended,  and  by  distribution  agreements, travel retail, e-commerce, social media and digital communication.\n\n## \u00b7 Digital expertise, CRM and innovation\n\nA number of projects have been set up to support Kering in its digital transformation and drive forward its e-commerce, CRM, data  science  and  innovation  activities.  Our  Digital  and  Client Relations  team  is  developing  One-to-Many,  One-to-Few  and One-to-One tools that are improving the customer experience and  customer  service.  We  are  using  artificial  intelligence  to make  better  predictions  in  our  production  planning.  The Group's  Innovation  team  is  continuing  to  fulfill  its  remit: instilling  an  internal  culture  of  innovation  and  working  on disruptive  technologies  to  enrich  our  business  models  and support our sustainability efforts.\n\n\"Digital is simultaneously accelerating and deepening our relationships with our clients, allowing us to offer them an exceptional shopping experience\"",

Our brands benefit  from  Group-wide  synergies  while  preserving  their unique characters and exclusivity.\n\n## \u00b7 Resource pooling\n\nOur Houses share certain support functions, allowing them to concentrate  on  what  really  counts:  creativity,  production quality,  product  range  development  and  renewal,  client relations,  as  well  as  brand  and  product  communication.  The Group  pools  resources  and  streamlines  certain  strategic functions  such  as  logistics,  indirect  purchasing,  legal  affairs, property, accounting, media relations, IT and the development of  new  tools  (in  particular  with  respect  to  the  omnichannel approach). Relieved of this burden, our Houses can focus their energy on creativity.\n\n## \u00b7 Cross-business expertise\n\nIn  order  to  enrich  its  brands'  offerings,  the  Group  draws  on cross-business  expertise.  A  notable  success  story  in  this domain  is  Kering  Eyewear,  which  has  been  developed internally  since  2014.  Our  Houses  benefit  from  having  a dedicated  specialist  entity  that  ensures  full  control  over  the value chain in their eyewear frame and sunglasses businesses, comprising  creation, development,  supply  chain,  brand strategy,  marketing  and  distribution.  Our  eyewear  unit  has been strengthened by the acquisitions of Lindberg and Maui Jim in the last two years.\n\n## \u00b7 Growth platforms and operating efficiency\n\nKering  is  constantly  improving  and  adapting  its  operating model to ensure that its structures are ever more up-to-date and flexible. The Group has launched an ambitious transformation  project  focusing  on  its  information  systems, supply chain and logistics. The aim is to adapt these functions\n\nto  the  Group's  new  scope,  as  well  as  to  changing  consumer trends  and  client  expectations.  With  shared,  state-of-the-art IT,  as  well  as  redefined  logistics  operations  that  include  the construction of new warehouses in the United States (2019), Italy  (2020-2021)  and  then  Asia  (Singapore  in  2022),  the Group's  brands  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  anticipate demand,  respond  more  quickly  and  adapt  their  inventory management in order to optimize costs.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent excellence\n\nWe pay particular attention to the professional development and fulfillment of the women and men working for our Houses and in our headquarters. Based on ever-greater mobility, our ambitious worldwide human resources strategy facilitates the growth  of  the  Houses  through  a  shared  pool  of  talented individuals, expertise and  excellence.  The  Group  helps employees reach their potential and express their creativity by developing  skills  and  performance,  as  well  as  by  offering aspirational development opportunities.\n\nOur policy of promoting  diversity, gender parity and inclusiveness  is  a  source  of  collective  intelligence  and enrichment  but  also  fundamental  to  our  culture  of  equality, allowing each individual to realize their full potential. It  also lies at the heart of talent management actions and initiatives taken by the Group and its Houses.\n\nKering  pays  particular  attention  to  the  role  of  women,  who make up the majority of our employees and clients. Internal systems  are  in  place  to  guarantee  gender  equality,  as evidenced by our ambitious global parental policy. The Kering Foundation  is  committed  to  combating  violence  against women, while the aim of the Women in Motion initiative is to showcase  the  contribution  of  women  to  the  film  industry, whether in front of the camera or behind.\n\n'The Group strives to create value for its Houses and is geared to unlocking their creative potential'\n\n<!-- image -->",

The logistics chain was also disrupted by measures taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7  Large movements in exchange rates driven by changes in monetary policy, particularly the US dollar's rise against the euro and the decline in the Japanese yen.\n- \u00b7  The resumption of tourism, particularly to Asia (excluding China) and Europe. However, tourism from China did not recover in 2022, because borders remained closed until January 2023.\n- \u00b7  Rising prices and changes in the product mix: although price increases for comparable products were relatively substantial again in 2022, they were limited by the large movements in exchange rates. The product mix became more upscale as a result of 'ultra-premiumization', i.e. the trend for sales to be concentrated in the most sophisticated and expensive segments of the product range, while the most aspirational consumers were more sensitive to the macroeconomic environment.\n- \u00b7  With the base for comparison in 2021 still affected by the COVID-19 crisis, there was a sharp upturn in store sales, particularly in Europe, while the growth rate of online sales returned to normal.",

This rebound in Chinese demand should have a beneficial impact on the Luxury industry.\n- \u00b7  However, the overall macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. Accordingly, Kering will continue to focus on constantly strengthening its brands, and show vigilance and agility in implementing its strategy.\n\nExperts expect the Luxury market to grow at a rate of 5-7% per year over the medium to long term (source: Bain-Altagamma, Euromonitor), driven by the following major trends:\n\n- \u00b7  The development of an urban middle class in emerging countries\n- \u00b7  A larger number of wealthy individuals and an increase in the value of their assets\n- \u00b7  Resilience and expansion in local client bases\n- \u00b7  The return of tourist customers\n- \u00b7  The appeal of an omni-channel approach\n- \u00b7  Second-hand luxury development, control and internalization\n- \u00b7  Meeting greater demand for personalization in terms of client relations and the customer experience through more sophisticated CRM tools\n- \u00b7  Generating loyalty among domestic customers, particularly in Asia\n- \u00b7  Greater demand for transparency and social and environmental responsibility\n- \u00b7  Emergence of Web3, leading to new customer expectations and new transformation challenges for luxury goods companies\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.2 Overview of the luxury market (1)\n\n## I. Size and trends\n\n## Size and medium to long-term growth\n\nIn 2022, the global luxury consumer goods market generated revenue of \u20ac350-390 billion according to Bain-Altagamma and Euromonitor.  The  relatively  wide  range  of  estimates  is  the result  of  differences  in  how  broadly  the  Jewelry,  Apparel  and Fragrances & Cosmetics categories are defined.\n\nIn the medium to long term, the luxury market is expected to grow  by  5-7%  per  year  according  to  Bain-Altagamma  and Euromonitor,  similar  to  the  average  rate  seen  in  the  last  15 years.\n\n## II. Competitive environment\n\nAlthough  fragmented,  the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods market is nonetheless characterized by the presence of a few large global players, often part of multi-brand groups, as well as  a  large  number  of  smaller  independent  players.  These players  compete  in  several  segments,  which  can  differ  in terms  of  both  product  category  and  geographic  location. Kering  operates  alongside  the  most  prominent  global  luxury groups: LVMH, Richemont, Herm\u00e8s, Chanel and Prada.\n\nOne  key  feature  in  2022  was  the  good  performance  of  the ultra-luxury  segment,  where  customers were less exposed to inflationary  pressure  and  the  deteriorating  macroeconomic environment, and which also benefited from its perception as a  safe  haven.  At  the  more  aspirational  end  of  the  luxury market,  the  base  for  comparison  was  high,  particularly  in certain categories such as sneakers.\n\n## III. Product categories\n\nThe  global  luxury  consumer  goods  market  breaks  down  into seven  main  product  categories:  apparel,  leather  goods, watches, jewelry, shoes, fragrances and cosmetics, and other.\n\nApparel  and  leather  goods  remain  the  sector's  two  largest categories.\n\nSector experts saw fairly even growth across all categories in 2022, although the base for comparison varied. Leather goods and  jewelry  have  consistently  posted  the  best  growth  rates since 2019, and over the medium to long term.\n\n## Estimated size of luxury product categories in 2022\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 40\n\n## Luxury consumer goods market estimates\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Apparel\n\nApparel  represented  between  21%  and  27%  of  the  luxury market in 2022. The large difference between the upper and lower  ends  of  this  estimate  results  from  differences  in  price ranges used in the analyses. In 2022, the apparel category saw an  upturn  in  sales  of  formalwear  and  casual  chic  pieces  for special  events  and  parties,  as  most  major  markets  benefited from the post-COVID reopening. All Kering couture and leather goods  Houses  operate  in  the  apparel  category,  especially Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and to a lesser  extent  Bottega  Veneta,  while  Brioni  operates  in  the menswear segment only.\n\n## Leather Goods\n\nThe revenue generated by leather goods in 2022 is estimated at \u20ac75-80 billion, or 21% of the total luxury goods market. This category  includes  handbags,  small  leather  goods  (wallets, purses,  etc.),  and  other  leather  products.  It  has  moved significantly  upscale  in  recent  years  due  to  changes  in  the product  and  price  mix.  Kering  operates  in  this  category primarily through the Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  Alexander  McQueen  and Balenciaga.\n\n## Shoes\n\nThis category has an estimated revenue of \u20ac30 billion. In 2022, 'black shoes' (including loafers and hybrid boots) and pumps made  a  comeback,  while  sneakers  -  which  were  the  big winners  during  the  COVID  period  -  saw  demand  return  to normal.  Kering  mainly  operates  in  this  product  category through  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga.\n\n## Watches\n\nSales in the watches category rebounded significantly in 2022 to  \u20ac50  billion,  making  up  much  of  the  ground  it  had  lost  to other  categories  in  terms  of  growth.  Kering  operates  in  this category  across  different  price  points  with  Gucci  Timepieces and Boucheron.\n\n## IV. Sales by region and nationality\n\n## Sales by region\n\nThe  American  continent  has  been  the  world's  largest  luxury consumer goods market since 2021, when its sales overtook those in  Europe.  Secondary  cities  such  as  Atlanta,  Detroit,  Houston and  Dallas  and  suburban  areas  continued  to  perform  well, while  large  cities  and  regions  (New  York,  Boston  and  Miami) regained  impetus.  In  2022,  however,  growth  in  the  Americas region  slowed  toward  the  end  of  the  year  as  American\n\n## Jewelry\n\nIt is hard to estimate the size of this category because it remains dominated by independent producers, and it is the one in which experts' estimates vary most widely. 2022 was a good year for the jewelry category, which was able to capitalize on the creativity of  producers  and  jewelry's  appeal  as  an  investment.  Major brands  (specialist  jewelry  brands  and  the  jewelry  ranges  of couture  and  leather  goods  houses)  have  been  consistently gaining market share from independents for more than a decade now.  Kering  operates  in  this  category  primarily  through Boucheron, Pomellato, DoDo and Qeelin, but also Gucci, whose offering ranges from fashion jewelry to a high jewelry collection.\n\n## Perfumes and cosmetics\n\nThis category has estimated revenue of \u20ac55-70 billion. Kering operates in it partly through licensing agreements with certain leading industry players such as L'Or\u00e9al, Coty and Interparfums to develop and sell perfumes and cosmetics. On February  3,  2023,  Kering  also  announced  the  creation  of Kering  Beaut\u00e9  in  order  to  develop  the  Beauty  category  for Bottega  Veneta,  Balenciaga,  Alexander  McQueen,  Pomellato and  Qeelin.  The  creation  of  Kering  Beaut\u00e9  will  enable  the Group  to  support  its  Houses  in  the  development  of  this category, which is a natural extension to their universe.\n\n## Other (eyewear, textile accessories, etc.)\n\nPersonal  luxury  goods  that  do  not  fit  into  the  categories mentioned  above  generated  an  estimated  \u20ac22  billion  in revenue in 2022. The global eyewear market is estimated to be worth over \u20ac100 billion (at retail prices) according to Mordor Intelligence  and  Euromonitor  data.  It  comprises  several product segments: spectacles, contact lenses, sunglasses and other  products.  The  high-end  (frames  and  sunglasses)  subsegment is estimated to be worth at least \u20ac7 billion at retail prices,  based  on  unit  prices  starting  from  \u20ac190.  In  2022,  the category  continued  to  make  progress,  driven  in  particular  by sunglasses. Kering Eyewear is positioned as a leading player in the strategically important high-end eyewear segment, with a comprehensive, balanced portfolio comprising brands such as Gucci,  Cartier,  Ala\u00efa,  Alexander  McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Bottega Veneta,  Brioni,  Chlo\u00e9,  Dunhill,  Montblanc,  Saint  Laurent  and Puma. The eyewear market is gradually consolidating through acquisitions:  for  example,  Kering  added  to  its  eyewear  brand portfolio in 2021 by acquiring Denmark's Lindberg and in 2022 by acquiring Maui Jim.\n\nconsumers started spending more money in Europe, attracted by a favorable exchange rate, and as spending on experiences made a comeback.\n\nEurope was resilient in 2022 despite the war in Ukraine and its macroeconomic  impact.  In  particular,  the  region  benefited from  US  and  Middle  Eastern  consumers  spending  money  in Europe  in  2022,  along  with  a  relatively  low  base  for comparison in the first few months of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Mainland China, demand again came mainly from domestic customers, who accounted for  most  sales  in  2022  because  borders  remained  closed. However, after firm growth in 2021, 2022 sales were seriously hampered  by  China's  zero-COVID  policy.  Southeast  Asia, meanwhile, posted strong growth.\n\n## Worldwide luxury market: breakdown by region in 2022e\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sales by nationality\n\nSince  2021,  American  consumers  have  been  the  leading buyers of luxury goods, overtaking the Chinese. In 2022, sales to  Chinese  customers  were  affected  by  repeated  lockdowns and China's closed borders. If China's reopening is confirmed in 2023, there is major scope for these consumers to make up for  lost  time,  with  Chinese  tourists  returning  to  Asia  and Western Europe.\n\n## Worldwide luxury market: breakdown by nationality in 2022e\n\nnationalities\n\n## V. Distribution channels\n\n## Retail channel\n\nIn  2022,  the  retail  channel  accounted  for  50%  of  in-person sales  in  the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods  market,  much higher than the 2019 figure of 40%. A solid network of directly operated stores is crucial to a luxury brand's success, since it strengthens its relationship with end consumers, and gives it greater control over its commercial offering and brand image.\n\nKering's  Houses  generate  a  much  larger  proportion  of  their sales  from  the  retail  channel  (78%).  This  is  due  to  Kering's strategic  aim  of  growing  its  network  of  directly  operated stores,  achieving  critical  mass  for  its  brands,  increasing  their exposure  to  leather  goods  (a  category  where  distribution  is more tightly controlled) and growing online sales through the Houses' own websites and e-concessions.\n\n## Wholesale channel\n\nThe  wholesale  channel  typically  includes  department  stores, independent  high-end  multi-brand  stores  and  franchise stores,  and  accounted  for  approximately  50%  of  the  total worldwide personal luxury goods market in 2022. This channel\n\ngenerally  accounts  for  a  larger  percentage  of  sales  in  the ready-to-wear  and  watches  categories.  It  is  also  particularly important for brands at an early stage in their development.\n\nFor Kering's Houses, the wholesale channel (which also includes other revenues) accounts for 22% of revenue. That proportion has fallen in recent years due to the Group's strategy of increasing its control over distribution and working with fewer partners.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nOnline  sales  of  luxury  goods  doubled  in  2020  compared  to 2019, and continued to grow at a rapid pace in 2021. However, growth returned to normal in 2022. Online sales account for 21%  of  the  total  luxury  goods  market.  This  includes  sales made  through  brand  websites  (retail  channel)  and  via department store websites and e-tailers (wholesale).\n\nKering's  Houses  operate  their  e-commerce  sites  directly.  In 2021  and  2022,  the  Group's  brands  took  greater  control  in terms of multibrand distribution, moving away from wholesale models  and  toward  e-concession  models.  Online  sales account for around 15% of retail sales on average.",

        "page_content": "## Business concept and strategy\n\nFounded as a leather goods shop in Florence in 1921, Gucci has since become one of the world's most recognizable luxury houses alongside Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Herm\u00e8s. The House's  timeless  appeal  lies  in  its  Italian  heritage  and  its positioning at the intersection of fashion and culture.\n\nGucci's offering includes Women's, Men's, and Kids' ranges and boasts  a  uniquely  healthy  mix  across  categories.  Its  product portfolio consistently balances the latest fashions with iconic products and spans entry-level items to high-end pieces. The House  is  focused  on  growing  all  its  core  categories  while amplifying its  presence  in  adjacent  segments  and  expanding the  boundaries  of  luxury  in  the  virtual  world.  Gucci's  early leadership  in  gaming  and  the  metaverse  has  allowed  it  to establish strong credibility in the space.\n\nIn  recent  years,  the  House  significantly  streamlined  its wholesale  footprint  both  offline  and  online,  while  still maintaining  strategic partnerships through  concessions. Gucci's  physical  network  comprises  528  directly  operated stores  and  a  limited  number  of  specialty  stores  and\n\n## Key highlights 2022\n\nGucci's 2022 strategy was to consolidate the fundamentals of the business. The brand continued to grow its share of upscale clients and maintained a healthy mix across generations.\n\nThe  physical  store  network  remained  roughly  stable  with  a steady program of refurbishments, while the digital business was  extended  to  new  countries.  The  House  invested  in bolstering  omnichannel  services  to  create  more  seamless customer  journeys:  it  scaled  remote  clienteling  through  its Gucci 9 client services, expanded in-store digital services, and launched Collect In-Store.\n\nThe brand increased the importance and impact of its three iconic  handbags:  Horsebit,  Jackie  and  Bamboo  1947.  At  the same time, Gucci ensured that its fashion shows were among the  most  anticipated  in  the  industry.  Gucci's  schedule  of events  in  2022  reflects  its  two-stroke  Fashion-and-Timeless strategy:  the  first  dedicated  Valigeria  travel  campaign,  a signature  high  jewelry  campaign,  and  a  one-of-its-kind collaboration  with  Adidas.  In  the  metaverse,  the  brand launched  the  Vault  Art  Space  featuring  NFT  artworks  and  a permanent Gucci Town on Roblox, among other initiatives.\n\nfranchises. Meanwhile, its digital footprint includes its directly operated website, active in 36 markets, and a small selection of digital concessions.\n\nGucci  has  gradually  secured  its  production  capabilities  by bringing  suppliers  in-house.  The  House  has  also  invested  in preserving  craftsmanship  through  ArtLab,  its  center  for  inhouse  prototyping  and  sampling,  and  \u00c9cole  de  l'Amour,  its education program for the next generation of artisans.\n\nGucci  Equilibrium  represents  the  House's  commitment  to generating positive change through comprehensive long-term environmental and social sustainability strategies. The House has  invested  in  reducing  and  offsetting  the  emissions generated by its direct operations and supply chain, and has consistently reduced its environmental P&L footprint in terms of  both  intensity  and  absolute  value  since  2018,  in  line  with Kering's sustainability strategy. As part of its social commitments, Gucci is focused on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and achieving gender pay parity.\n\nThroughout  the  year,  Gucci  made  significant  adjustments  to its  operating model, revising its merchandizing structure and redesigning  its  Design  Office  and  Product  Development organizations.  The  House  also  made  several  changes  to  its senior  leadership  including  a  new  Brand  General  Manager  in charge  of  Product,  a  new  Brand  &  Client  Officer  in  charge  of Communication, and new regional Presidents in Greater China and  EMEA.  At  the  end  of  2022,  Alessandro  Michele  stepped down  as  Gucci's  Creative  Director  after  nearly  eight  years during which his groundbreaking vision played a fundamental role in Gucci's success.\n\nIn  2023,  the  House  will  focus  on  setting  up  its  new  creative organization and establishing the required structure to ensure that  it  can  consolidate  its  leadership  within  the  luxury industry, deliver sustainable long-term growth, and achieve its medium-term  sales  target  of  \u20ac15  billion  and  historical recurring operating margin (1) .\n\nOn  January  28,  2023,  Gucci  announced  the  appointment  of Sabato de Sarno as its new Creative Director.

        "page_content": "## Business concept and strategy\n\nFounded in 1961 by Yves Saint Laurent, the House is among the  most  prominent  and  respected  fashion  names  in  the world.  Originally  a  House  of  Haute  Couture,  Saint  Laurent revolutionized the way fashion and society merge and interact in  1966  with  the  introduction  of  pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter,  high-end ready-to-wear  clothes  produced  on  a  larger  scale  than  the exclusive collections.\n\nSince  then,  Saint  Laurent's  offering  has  expanded  to  include women's and men's ready-to-wear clothes, shoes, handbags, small  leather  goods,  jewelry,  scarves,  ties  and  eyewear, defining a highly desirable and contemporary silhouette.\n\nUnder  the  creative  vision  of  Anthony  Vaccarello  and  the leadership of Francesca Bellettini, Saint Laurent has built very strong foundations for sustainable, long-term growth. Much of the House's success stems from its uncompromising approach  to  creativity,  quality  and  craftsmanship.  With  clear and  distinctive  codes  expressed  in  continually  compelling collections, Saint Laurent has become one of the most desired houses in luxury.\n\nThrough  its  network  of  280  directly  operated  stores  as  of December  31,  2022,  along  with  its  digital  platforms  and\n\n## Key highlights 2022\n\n2022 proved to be another outstanding year for Saint Laurent.\n\nBy  offering  clients  a  distinctive  silhouette,  the  House  saw growth across all product categories in 2022.\n\nSaint  Laurent  has  achieved  these  results  by  building  on  its heritage while remaining always of the moment, without ever compromising on image and positioning.\n\nThough  the  gradual  return  of  international  travel  had  a favorable  impact  on  store  traffic  in  some  regions  in  2022, Saint  Laurent  remained  focused  on  nurturing  relationships with local clients. By treating every customer as if they were a local client, the Saint Laurent client advisors further enhanced customer loyalty.\n\nDuring the year, Saint Laurent also opened seven new stores in Europe, five in the Americas and six in Asia, which all present excellent opportunities for business development and materially contributed to 2022 performance, in addition to the growth achieved by existing stores.\n\ncarefully  selected  wholesale  clients,  Saint  Laurent  competes globally with the most exclusive luxury houses. Focus on retail excellence and  the  establishment  of  strong  customer relationships  have  been  strategic  priorities  for  Saint  Laurent for  many  years.  With  a  new  architectural  vision  for  its  retail stores  being  introduced  in  2023,  the  House  will  further enhance the client experience.\n\nBehind  the  scenes,  Saint  Laurent  is  coordinating  production and  logistics  more  efficiently  than  ever  before.  The  House recently  added  production  capacity  for  shoes  and  ready-towear  apparel  at  its  workshop  in  Angers  (France),  and  is  also developing  a  new  center  of  excellence  for  leather  goods production  in  Italy  that  is  expected  to  open  in  2023.  Saint Laurent has been leveraging Kering's logistics hub in Northern Italy for even greater efficiency. These investments in state-ofthe-art facilities will keep Saint Laurent at the forefront of the industry.\n\nThough  the  House  achieved  record  results  in  2022,  there  is still  considerable  potential  to  expand  sales  and  enhance business  performance.  Saint  Laurent  is  confident  in  the opportunities for sustainable growth.\n\nWhile  improving  client  service  and  developing  the  store network,  the  House  further  increased  control  over  its distribution in 2022.  By  putting  greater  emphasis  on concessions  as  part  of  its  network  of  selected  wholesale partners, Saint Laurent has strengthened its luxury positioning and fostered a consistent customer experience.\n\nThe House has also extended its control in online sales. Saint Laurent's  management  of  its  presence  on  digital  platforms ensures brand integrity while fostering efficient management of inventory, pricing and merchandizing online.\n\nSaint  Laurent  continues  to  expand  its  cultural  reach  and impact  with  a  series  of  exhibitions  and  collaborations  with leading artists. Moreover, the House's Rive Droite locations in Paris and Los Angeles have become hubs of cultural activity as well as thriving retail stores.\n\nIn 2022, having reached its previous objectives, Saint Laurent updated its medium-term ambitions in terms of revenue (now \u20ac5 billion) and recurring operating margin (now 33%) (1) .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Bottega  Veneta  is  globally recognized  for  the  excellence  of  its  leather  goods  and  its signature braiding technique  known  as  intrecciato.  Its aesthetic is highly regarded for being discreet yet bold, and for its  timelessness,  individuality,  joie  de  vivre  and  cultural advocacy.\n\nWith  the  appointment  of  Bartolomeo  Rongone  as  Chief Executive  Officer  in  2019  and  Matthieu  Blazy  as  Creative Director  in  2021,  Bottega  Veneta  is  establishing  itself  as  an ultra-high-end  luxury  fashion  house  that  leverages  a  bold approach  to  achieve  distinctive  creativity  while  delivering superior  craftsmanship.  With  a  natural  instinct  aligned  with the essence of Bottega Veneta, Matthieu Blazy has embraced Bottega  Veneta's  core  values  and  will  continue  to  keep  the House fully relevant.\n\nIn recent years, Bottega Veneta has successfully evolved from a  leather  goods  house  into  a  luxury  fashion  house,  with collections highlighting a full silhouette and a wider range of products  appealing  to  an  international  clientele  of  men  and\n\n## Key highlights 2022\n\nBottega  Veneta  achieved  record  revenue  in  2022,  with  each quarter  delivering  the  highest  sales  in  the  House's  history. Bottega Veneta's strong momentum was fueled by increased brand desirability, coveted collections and a positive reception of its creativity.\n\nIn  February  2022,  Matthieu  Blazy  unveiled  his  debut  Winter 2022  collection  in  Milan  Fashion  Week.  The  response  to  the collection  was  extremely  positive  among  the  press  and  the fashion and creative communities. This hotly anticipated first collection arrived in stores in September 2022 and has been a resounding commercial success. As a result, there was a great deal  of  excitement  about  Matthieu's  sophomore  collection, which was revealed in a set designed by famed artist Gaetano Pesce. The show received rave reviews and was considered as one of the most popular collections of all the Spring/Summer fashion week.\n\nDuring  the  year,  Bottega  Veneta  focused  on  communication initiatives  based  around  iconization  and  cultural  advocacy. Key  moments  included  the  unveiling  of  handbag  capsule collections  inspired  by  Olivetti  typewriters  and  New  York bookstore The Strand. Concurrently, Bottega Veneta continued its  sponsorship  of  key  cultural  events  including  the  Biennale di Danza in Venice, the BUTT magazine relaunch, partnerships with NTS radio, DIA Beacon and the Festival de Hy\u00e8res among others.  Bottega  Veneta  also  adopted  an  enhanced  localized\n\nwomen. This strategy has propelled Bottega Veneta into new territories:  while  continuing  to  value  discretion,  the  House  is engaging with a broader audience to unveil its  full  potential while  continuing  to  maintain  a  balance  between  attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. In addition to the intrecciato, Bottega Veneta has been successful in establishing new, highly recognizable codes and icons that are regarded as the pinnacle of creativity and craftsmanship.\n\nIts  business and creative teams are working hand in hand to increase  brand  desirability  and  awareness  with  a  focus  on long-term  organic  growth.  Additionally,  a  value  strategy  has been implemented, focusing on high-quality sales alongside a controlled and selective distribution strategy.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Bottega  Veneta  retail  network consisted  of  271  directly  operated  stores  across  all  key geographies,  as  well  as  e-commerce  capabilities  across  45 countries. Its retail operation is complemented by a presence in  select  multi-brand boutiques, exclusive department stores and specialty stores worldwide, while the wholesale business is gradually focusing on higher-quality partners.\n\ncommunication  strategy.  These  included  a  takeover  of  the Great  Wall  of  China  to  celebrate  Chinese  New  Year,  a  'lucky day' campaign in Japan and the unveiling of Love in Motion, a film by Chinese director Jess Zou.\n\nThroughout 2022, Bottega Veneta upgraded its store network with new flagship openings and popups showcasing innovative creativity (Design Miami). The House also completed the process of gaining direct control over its retail stores in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA  key  milestone  for  Bottega  Veneta  was  the  launch  of 'Certificate  of  Craft'.  This  program  extends  the  lives  of  its iconic bags, with the House guaranteeing to refresh, repair and replace them  beyond  the  standard  two-year  warranty. Similarly,  the  unveiling  of  Bottega  Series  -  in  which  pieces from  the  archives  are  re-released  -  is  central  to  Bottega Veneta's philosophy of making products that are designed to last forever and represent the highest and most refined form of luxury.\n\nIn 2023, the House will continue to emphasize its ultra-highend position at the place where creativity and craftsmanship meet.  Bottega  Veneta  will  maintain  its  focus  on  value enhancement  and  exclusive  distribution.  It  will  continue  to raise  the  quality  of  its  directly  operated  retail  network,  with strategic  new  store  openings  and  improvements  to  existing stores.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is an intensely black-hued material  made  from  recycled  industrial  waste,  representing the  creative  team's  approach  of  taking  things  that  have reached the end of their life cycle and making them precious. Also  in  2022,  Boucheron  published  its  first  sustainability impact  report,  setting  out  the  House's  clear  mission  of designing a desirable future.",

This strategy is implemented within each of the Houses, which translate the Group's  objectives  into  practical  action  plans  and  report  on the progress made with respect to each of the strategy's three pillars on a regular basis.\n\nMore than 40 specialists reporting to the Chief Sustainability and  Institutional  Affairs  Officer  -  who  is  a  member  of  the Executive Committee -assist the Houses with the implementation  of  the  Group's  strategy  by  systematically looking for potential synergies and continuous improvement. In  addition,  each  House  has  at  least  one  Sustainability  Lead, while the larger Houses have entire Sustainability teams. As a result,  Kering  has  more  than  100  people  working  solely  on sustainability.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  also  had  a  Sustainability Committee since 2012. This committee's brief is to assist and support the Group in designing, implementing and monitoring its sustainability  strategy,  along  with  its  principles  and practices regarding social and ethical responsibility. The Board has  also  increased  its  capabilities  in  terms  of  taking  these issues into account by appointing a Lead Independent Director (in 2019) and a Climate Change Lead (in 2022) (1) .\n\n## 8.2 Our strategy for 2025\n\nSustainability  has  always  played  a  central  role  in  Kering's strategy.  Many  of  Kering's  activities  rely  on  high-quality  raw materials and exceptional expertise, and so depend directly on balanced, smooth-running  ecosystems  and  respect  for individuals. Protecting resources and the planet, and having a positive impact on its employees, partners, suppliers and their communities,  is  therefore  vital  for  the  Group  to  continue growing  in  a  sustainable  way.  The  focus  on  sustainability  is also an opportunity to reinvent the luxury industry as a whole, in order to devise a more sustainable and responsible form of luxury.  Accordingly,  Kering  is  implementing  an  ambitious sustainability  strategy  for  the  period  until  2025,  based  on three inputs:\n\nThe Group  has  a  particularly innovative approach  to environmental  issues.  Since  2012,  Kering  has  developed  its environmental  profit  and  loss  (EP&L)  account,  which  is  a reporting  tool  to  measure  and  quantify  its  environmental footprint  across  the  whole  value  chain.  The  tool  enables  the Group  to  understand  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to environmental challenges, focusing on six themes: greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, water consumption,  waste  production  and  land  use.  It  therefore helps Kering identify the main ways in which it can reduce its environmental  footprint.  Kering  has  undertaken  to  reduce  its EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025 compared with 2015.\n\nThe  Group's  environmental  approach  is  based  on  three complementary aspects: climate, biodiversity and circularity.\n\nKering has identified environmental impacts in each stage of its value chain, as set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 a materiality analysis highlighting priority issues, consistent with  the  Group's  own  priorities  and  the  expectations  of stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 an  analysis  of  non-financial  risks,  pinpointing  the  main non-financial risks in all parts of the value chain.\n\nThe Group's objectives and actions are organized around three pillars  and  are  aligned  with  the  United  Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and with 13 of them in particular.\n\n- \u00b7 the  vision  and  ambition  adopted  by  the  Group's  top management, i.e., to be the world's most influential Luxury group  in  terms  of  creativity,  sustainability  and  long-term economic performance;\n\n- 58",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Climate risks fully integrated into the business strategy\n\nKering has made climate action a key part of its strategy. The Group's  2022  EP&L  results  show  that  38%  of  Kering's environmental  impacts  relate  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions. Given the link between climate protection and the long-term viability of its business, the Group takes into account material climate-related  risks  (physical  risks  and  transition  risks)  in order to achieve greater resilience. To address these risks, the Group has developed a climate strategy  based  on  four  main aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Mitigating  climate-related  risks  by  reducing  emissions: Kering has designed its targets according to the reference framework  defined  by  the  Science  Based  Target  Initiative (SBTi) and is committed to a 90% reduction in its absolute greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  its  operations  (scopes  1 and 2) by 2030, along with a 70% reduction in intensity in its supply chains (scope 3).\n- \u00b7 Adapting  and  achieving  resilience  with  nature-based solutions: the  Group  favors  sourcing  materials  from regenerative agriculture, which aims to protect and restore biodiversity and soil health.\n- \u00b7 Positive  contribution  to  the  climate: Kering  has  made  a commitment  to  offsetting  residual  emissions  from  all  of the  Group's  own  activities  and  those  of  its  supply  chain, aiming  for  a  Net  Zero  trajectory  consistent  with  the ambition of the Paris agreements.\n- \u00b7 Industry transformation: through partnerships and coalitions  like  OP2B  and  the  Fashion  Pact,  Kering  aims  to develop  a  new,  holistic  approach  to  managing  climaterelated  risks,  mitigating  their  impact  and  contributing  to global climate-related objectives.\n\nKering  has  been  a  member  of  the  TCFD  (Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) since 2017. It monitors the work done by the TCFD and follows its recommendations. In 2022, the Group mapped 19 risks and opportunities related to  climate  change.  An  initial  impact  assessment  covering  a selection  of  those  risks  and  opportunities  was  carried  out, with  the  help  of  scenarios  developed  on  the  basis  of  two assumptions involving 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C trajectories. The details of this initial exercise are provided in Chapter 4, \"Sustainability\".\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  commitments  in  terms  of  climate action, a decision was made in 2021 to appoint a member of the  Board  of  Directors  as  Climate  Change  Lead  with  effect from 2022 and to add the topic as an agenda item at Board meetings twice a year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group uses a continuous improvement approach, analyzing feedback and taking action accordingly to improve its business processes. In order to manage, anticipate and mitigate its  risk  exposure,  and  to  ensure  that  it  can  develop  its  business  sustainably  over  the  long  term,  the  Group  has  set  up  a  risk management system that involves three lines of defense.\n\n## THE THREE LINES OF DEFENSE\n\nThe \"three lines of defense\" model provides a clear definition of responsibilities based on three aspects of risk management included in a robust internal control framework: managing risks, monitoring risks and insuring against risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First line of defense: day-to-day risk management\n\nThe  first  line  of  defense  involves  managing  risk.  All  Kering employees manage risk in their day-to-day work, overseen by operational managers who are responsible for internal control measures and who must ensure that those measures reduce risk to an acceptable level.\n\nAccordingly, the first line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 identify,  assess,  control  and  mitigate  risks  by  defining  and implementing internal rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 take  remedial  action  to  address  process  and  control failures;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  way  in  which  teams  apply  and  formalize controls  in  the  Group's  accounts  closing  and  compliance systems.\n\n## Second line of defense: day-to-day risk monitoring\n\nThe second line of defense consists of functions that measure and qualify risks, then ensure that they are properly covered.\n\nThose functions must:\n\n- \u00b7 develop risk management guidelines;\n- \u00b7 identify known and emerging problems and deal with alerts relating  to  them,  as  well  as  changes  in  the  way  risks  are regulated;\n- \u00b7 issue  directives  and  provide  training  in  risk  management procedures;\n\n- \u00b7 facilitate  monitoring  regarding  the  implementation  of effective risk procedures and controls devised by management;\n- \u00b7 ensure  that  the  Group's  risk  assessment  approach  is implemented  at  the  process  level  by  regional  internal control officers;\n- \u00b7 test  control  activities  through  self-assessments  and  peer reviews,  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control using tools.\n\n## Third line of defense: independent risk management\n\nInternal  audit  is  the  third  line  of  defense.  It  independently performs risk management operations. Internal audit periodically assesses the design and effectiveness of the first two  lines  of  defense  and  helps  improve  the  internal  control system through its recommendations.\n\nAccordingly, the third line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 depending on the issue, check that the measures in place, including governance methods, comply with regulatory and statutory requirements;\n- \u00b7 carry  out  audits  by  observing  practices,  speaking  to  staff members  involved  in  audit  activities  and  preparing  audit reports;\n- \u00b7 analyze and check the effectiveness of existing control and financial reporting procedures;\n- \u00b7 define  an  annual  internal  audit  plan  with  the  Group's governance bodies (Board of Directors and Audit Committee).",

However, combined with other geopolitical crises,  it  increased  the  pressure  on  supply  chains  and created concern about the economic outlook among both consumers and the financial markets;\n- \u00b7 China's  economic  growth  slowed  to  3.0%  according  to Oxford Economics (1) as a result of the zero-COVID policy that China strictly enforced for most of the year, which affected consumer spending in particular;\n- \u00b7 More  generally,  expectations  regarding  global  economic growth were downgraded. The world economy could grow by  an  estimated  3.0%  in  2022,  whereas  growth  was previously  expected  at  4.2%  in  January  2022.  The  vast majority of economies could see growth within a range of around 1.5% to 3.5%. The only economies able to post really strong  performance  in  2022  could  be  those  in  the  Gulf (7.3%) and Southeast Asia (5.5%);\n- \u00b7 This general slowdown in global growth was accompanied by  large  movements  in  exchange  rates  between  major currencies,  arising  partly  from  central  bank  monetary policies.  2022  brought  a  sharp  rise  in  the  US  dollar  (and linked currencies) against the euro, along with a decline in the  Japanese  yen;  those  movements  helped  to  increase regional  differences  in  the  prices  of  Luxury  brands' products, encouraging people to buy those products during vacations;\n- \u00b7 Inflation  is  very  high  and  could  reach  7.8%  in  2022  as  a whole.  In  particular,  rising  prices  are  affecting  consumers' unavoidable  expenditure  and  reducing  their  purchasing power,  especially  since  measures  to  support  consumer spending  in  major  economies  mainly  took  place  in  2020 and 2021;\n- \u00b7 Rising interest rates, turbulence in financial markets - with a decline of 8.8% for the Dow Jones but a 33.1% drop for the Nasdaq  -  but  also  the  collapse  in  the  value  of cryptocurrencies also adversely affected sentiment among consumers  and  their  propensity  to  spend.  However, consumers in Western economies spent some of the excess savings  that  they  had  built  up  since  2020,  which  partly cushioned the cyclical decline in consumer spending.\n\nQuarterly figures show that after a very good start to the year, growth slowed in the second quarter because of the high base for comparison and the impact of store closures in China as a result of the deteriorating COVID-19 situation. Sales were firm in the third quarter, mainly due to a sharp tourist-driven rise in  sales  in  Western  Europe.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  growth appears to have been much more moderate, but there is not currently  any  reliable  consensus  about  the  extent  of  the slowdown.  China's  handling  of  the  pandemic  continued  to depress  domestic  demand,  while  overall  consumer  spending in the  United  States  was  affected  by  a  less  positive macroeconomic environment.\n\nPerformances also varied widely from one region to another:\n\n- \u00b7 Sales  rebounded  strongly  in  Western  Europe  from  a  low base caused by the negative impact of COVID-19 restrictions  in  2021,  and  despite  the  outbreak  of  the conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine.  Domestic  consumer spending  was  strong,  mainly  in  the  spring  and  summer, while sales to tourists (primarily from the US) rose sharply;\n- \u00b7 Revenue growth in North America slowed from the second quarter  onward,  and  particularly  in  the  final  months  of 2022.  This  was  partly  because  of  US  consumers  shifting their spending to Europe, attracted by a favorable exchange rate, along with the impact of inflation on the real incomes of  the  most  aspirational  customers.  However,  trends  over three years (i.e. relative to 2019) remained excellent;\n- \u00b7 In Japan, as in Europe where the recovery was more gradual than  in  other  major  markets,  industry  sales  rose  sharply, moving back to or above 2019 levels; at the end of the year, sales  in  Japan  benefited  particularly  from  an  influx  of Korean  consumers,  attracted  by  the  price  differential caused  by  movements  in  the  Japanese  yen/Korean  won exchange rate;\n- \u00b7 In  Asia-Pacific,  the  situation  in  China  from  March  onward affected  the  region's  overall  performance.  However,  sales rebounded strongly in Southeast Asia due to firm economic growth in that region's countries;\n- \u00b7 Finally, other regions of the world saw outstanding growth in  business  levels,  particularly  the  Middle  East,  with  only Eastern  Europe  seeing  a  decline  due  to  Russia's  status  as the main market in that region.\n\nCompared to 2021, all product categories posted fairly similar revenue  growth  rates.  Compared  to  2019,  however,  2022 showed very strong sales growth in Leather Goods and Jewelry sales,  a  substantial  upturn  in  Watches  and  more  moderate growth in Ready-To-Wear.\n\n- 64",

        "page_content": "It is also notable that the impact of structural changes in the Luxury  industry  in  recent  years,  amplified  by  the  COVID-19 crisis, seem to have become normalized in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 E-commerce  sales  once  again  posted  robust  growth in 2022, but their rate of increase started to converge with that seen in physical retail networks, which benefited from a  rebound  in  tourism  in  Europe  and  a  lower  base  for comparison;  accordingly,  the  proportion  of  total  sales coming from e-commerce is now stabilizing.\n- \u00b7 Despite  the  upturn  in  tourism  in  Europe  and  to  a  certain extent in Asia (apart from China), demand for Luxury goods remained  largely  domestic,  and  tourists  accounted  for  a\n\n- smaller proportion of Luxury brand revenues than in 2019 (sales down by 21% in Europe in 2022 according to Planet). However, Travel Retail sales seem to be recovering and may have  risen  40%  in  2022  according  to  Bain  &  CompanyAltagamma.\n- \u00b7 In the short and medium term, demand from Generations Y and Z remains one of the principal growth drivers for the global Luxury market. This customer segment is continuing to account for a growing proportion of sales, but the rate of increase is slowing since its penetration was already high at the end of 2022 (an estimated 65% of revenue according to Bain & Company-Altagamma).\n\n## In 2022, the main adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was on Chinese demand\n\nFrom the start  of  the  year,  the  COVID-19  situation  improved considerably in North America and Western Europe, leading to the gradual lifting of most restrictive public health measures, despite further waves of infection taking place during the year. As a result, the Group's operations in these two regions were not  affected.  In  Europe,  they  even  received  a  boost  from  a sharp upturn in tourist numbers after travel restrictions were lifted.\n\nIn  Japan  and  most other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the  gradual  easing  of  measures  to  control  the  pandemic throughout the first half of 2022 had a major positive impact on consumers' confidence and propensity to spend.\n\nIn China, however, the strict zero-COVID policy was maintained until early December, hampering business levels in the Luxury sector.  From  the  end  of  the  first  quarter,  China  applied Draconian  testing  and  lockdown  measures  when  COVID-19 cases  were  identified.  This  dragged  down  both  store  footfall and online sales, and led to significant volatility in consumer spending. After China changed its strategy for dealing with the\n\npandemic  at  the  end  of  the  year,  rising  COVID-19  case numbers  also  affected  the  economic  recovery.  As  a  result, over 2022 as a whole, China could probably be the only large market  where  the  Luxury  sector's  sales  fell  relative  to  2021, although they were much higher than in 2019.\n\nAlso,  spending  by  Chinese  consumers  mainly  took  place  in China  in  2022,  as  it  had  in  the  previous  two  years.  Chinese tourist  numbers  were  particularly  low,  which  continued  to affect  the  performance  of  the  travel  retail  segment  and  of certain  stores  in  Europe  and  Asia  relative  to  2019.  However, starting  in  the  spring,  sales  to  tourists  of  other  nationalities, particularly  American,  helped  offset  the  loss  of  opportunity arising from the absence of Chinese tourists.\n\nOverall,  the  pandemic  had  a  very  limited  or  almost  nonexistent  impact  on  Luxury  houses'  main  markets,  with  the notable exception of China. However, the total impact remains hard  to  measure,  since  the  deterioration  in  the  various economies' growth outlook has multiple causes that are very indirectly connected to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## The Group's direct exposure to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is limited\n\nIn  response  to  the  escalation  in  the  Russia-Ukraine  crisis, which became an armed conflict on February 23, 2022, Kering announced  on  March  4,  2022  that  it  would  close  the  stores operated by the Group's Houses in Russia. Kering's Houses do not operate any stores in Ukraine.\n\nGiven the severity of the situation, Kering and its Houses have lent  their  support  to  humanitarian  efforts  and  to  Ukrainian refugees  by  making  several  donations,  mainly  to  the  UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  have  limited  direct  exposure  to  the crisis. In 2021, Kering generated around 1% of its total annual revenue in Ukraine and Russia, and the net value of its assets in those countries was not material (around 0.1% of the Group total assets).\n\nOperating  losses  are  recognized  under  recurring  operating expenses  for  the  year.  IFRS  16  lease  right-of-use  assets, property,  plant  and  equipment  and  other  assets  were  fully written down in the second half of 2022 for a total amount of \u20ac36  million,  and  the  write-down  was  recognized  as  a non-recurring operating expense.\n\nIn addition, in view of international sanctions, the Group has reorganized  its  procurement  of  diamonds  and  has  ceased sourcing diamonds either directly or indirectly from Russia. It should  be  noted,  however,  that  its  diamond  purchases  from Russia were not material.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has obviously had a negative impact on the global economic outlook. Depending on its duration and extent,  the  conflict  could  affect  global  economic  growth  and therefore  the  Luxury  market  over  a  longer  period.  Since  that impact  is  indirect,  it  does  not  appear  possible  to  quantify  it precisely.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  transaction  was completed on May 31, 2022 according to the agreed terms.\n\nThe  Group  supported  the  two  Houses  in  their  development, strengthened  their  market  positions  and  ensured  they  have\n\nadequate  resources  to  finance  their  growth.  The  Group  is confident that their management will be able to continue their work successfully.\n\nThis transaction is in line with Kering's strategy, giving priority to  Houses  that  have  the  potential  to  become  sizable  assets within the Group and to which it can provide decisive support over time.\n\n## Kering Eyewear's acquisition of eyewear brand Maui Jim\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Kering Eyewear announced the signature of  an  agreement  to  acquire  US  eyewear  brand  Maui  Jim,  Inc. The transaction was completed on October 3, 2022 and Maui Jim has been fully consolidated in the Kering group's financial statements since October 1, 2022.\n\nFounded in 1987, Maui Jim is the world's largest independently owned  high-end  eyewear  brand  with  a  leading  position  in North America. Recognized for its outstanding technicity, Maui Jim  offers  a  broad  spectrum  of  high-quality  sun  and  optical frames  sold  in  more  than  100  countries  and  has  developed the revolutionary lens technology known as PolarizedPlus2 \u00ae .\n\nSince  its  inception  in  2014,  Kering  Eyewear  has  built  an innovative business model that enabled the company to reach more than \u20ac700m external revenues in FY2021. The acquisition\n\nof  Maui  Jim  represents  a  major  milestone  in  the  successful expansion strategy of Kering Eyewear. Only a few months after the  acquisition  of  Lindberg,  Kering  Eyewear  owns  a  second proprietary  brand,  reinforce  its  status  on  the  high-end eyewear segment and broaden its offer to cover the full scope from functional to timeless and fashion Luxury products.\n\nTheir  complementary  distribution  networks  and  product offerings  contribute  to  amplify  the  growth  potential  through the  expansion  of  Maui  Jim's  geographical  footprint  and  the ability  to  gain  new  customers,  more  focused  on  innovation and  functionalities.  This  acquisition  takes  Kering  Eyewear  to the next level,  with  revenues  materially  ahead  of  the  billioneuro  mark  on  a  full-year  basis  and  profit  margins  further improving.\n\n## Gianfilippo Testa appointed CEO of Alexander McQueen\n\nOn  March  21,  2022,  Kering  announced  the  appointment  of Gianfilippo  Testa  as  CEO  of  Alexander  McQueen,  effective May 2022. He reports to Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault.\n\nHe succeeds Emmanuel Gintzburger, who decided to leave the Group to pursue new professional challenges outside Kering.\n\nGianfilippo  Testa  is  an  Italian  national  with  an  outstanding track  record  in  the  Luxury  industry  in  Europe  and  Asia.  He started his career at TAG Heuer in 2002 and went on to hold a\n\nrange of roles at LVMH, specifically at Fendi in Italy, Japan and Hong  Kong.  He  joined  Kering  in  2016  as  Gucci  President Greater China and since 2019 has been President of EMEA and VP Global Retail at Gucci.\n\nAs CEO of Alexander McQueen, Gianfilippo Testa's mission will be to accelerate the expansion of the British Luxury House in order to tap its full potential.\n\n## Changes in the membership of the Board of Directors\n\nDuring 2022, Kering's Board of Directors, in coordination with the Appointments and Governance Committee, confirmed the following changes in its membership:\n\n- \u00b7 resignation  of  Ms.  Sophie  L'H\u00e9lias  and  Ms.  Jean  Liu  from their roles as independent directors;\n- \u00b7 appointment of Ms. V\u00e9ronique Weill, Ms. Yonca Dervisoglu and Mr. Serge Weinberg as independent Directors;\n- \u00b7 appointment  of  Ms.  V\u00e9ronique  Weill  as  Lead  Independent Director;\n- \u00b7 appointment of Mr. Jean-Pierre Denis as Climate Change Lead;\n- \u00b7 renewal  of  Ms.  Daniela  Riccardi's  term  of  office  as independent Director;\n- \u00b7 non-renewal  of  Ms.  Yseulys  Costes'  term  of  office  as independent Director;\n\n- \u00b7 appointment  of  Mr.  Vincent  Schaal  by  the  Social  and Economic  Committee  as  Director  representing  employees, replacing Ms. Claire Lacaze;\n- \u00b7 reconfiguration of the Board of Directors' Committees.\n\nAs a result, Kering's Board of Directors consisted of 13 members as of December 31, 2022, including:\n\n- \u00b7 six independent  Directors (55%  of Board  members excluding  Directors  representing  employees  in  accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code);\n- \u00b7 five  women  (45%  of  Board  members  excluding  directors representing employees in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code);\n- \u00b7 five  different  nationalities  (British,  French,  Italian,  Ivorian and Turkish).",

        "page_content": "## Dual-tranche bond issue for a total amount of \u20ac1.5 billion\n\nOn  April  28,  2022,  Kering  issued  \u20ac1.5  billion  of  bonds consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 a \u20ac750 million tranche with a 3-year maturity and a 1.25% coupon;\n- \u00b7 and a \u20ac750 million tranche with an 8-year maturity and a 1.875% coupon.\n\nThis  issue,  which  forms  part  of  the  Group's  active  liquidity management, enhances its funding flexibility by enabling it to refinance  existing  debt  and,  in  part,  finance  the  Maui  Jim acquisition.  The  issue  saw  strong  demand  from  bond investors,  confirming  the  market's  confidence  in  the  Group's credit quality. Kering's long-term debt is rated A with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's.\n\n## Launch of an employee shareholder transaction\n\nOn  May  4,  2022,  Kering  announced  the  launch  of  its  first employee  shareholder  transaction.  It  took  place  in  France, Italy,  the  United Kingdom, the United States, Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and South Korea.\n\nEntitled  KeringForYou,  the  program  gave  eligible  employees the opportunity to become  Kering  shareholders with preferential terms.

Due  to  the  euro  weakening against  other  major  currencies,  the  positive  exchange-rate effect  arose  mainly  from  sales  denominated  in  US  dollars (\u20ac557 million) and Chinese yuan (\u20ac281 million).\n\n- 68\n\nChanges  in  scope  had  a  smaller,  but  still  positive,  effect  on Group  revenue.  They  included  positive  contributions  from Lindberg  (consolidated  from  October  1,  2021)  and  Maui  Jim (consolidated from October 1, 2022), and the negative impact from  the  deconsolidation  of  watch  brands  Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin on January 1, 2022.\n\nAll  Houses  and  Kering  Eyewear  achieved  year-on-year  sales growth in 2022.\n\nThe increase in business levels relative to 2019 - regarded as a normative  benchmark,  since  it  was  the  last  year  before  the pandemic  -  was  also  very  robust,  with  comparable  revenue growth of 25%.",

This very good performance was driven by robust domestic demand for most of the year and an upturn in tourist numbers from the spring, despite  the  ongoing  absence  of  Chinese  tourists.  More marginally, there was positive effect on revenue arising from the low base for comparison, since part of the region's store network was closed in the first half of 2021.\n\nIn Japan, revenue was up 25% on a comparable basis relative to 2021, taking it above its 2019 level. Sales to local customers rose sharply, but the Japanese market was also buoyed by its appeal for Asian tourists, due to the relatively weak Yen.\n\nRevenue in North America rose by 5% on a comparable basis in  2022  (and  by  70%  relative  to  2019),  and  the  base  for comparison  was  high.  Performance  in  the  second  half  was\n\n## Group revenue by distribution channel\n\n% weight based on revenue before Eliminations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales  from  directly  operated  stores  and  e-commerce  sites came in at \u20ac16,007 million in 2022, up 10% on a comparable basis  relative  to  2021.  The  previous  comments  regarding performance  by  region  in  2022  also  apply  to  the  growth trajectory of retail sales.\n\naffected  by  American  customers  shifting  their  purchases  to Western  Europe,  and  by  weaker  domestic  demand  against  a backdrop of higher inflation.\n\nIn Asia-Pacific - the Group's largest region in terms of revenue, accounting for 33% of the total - revenue was down 8% on a comparable basis relative to 2021. The decline was solely due to China, where sales were adversely affected by the country's zero-COVID policy almost throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter. In all other markets in the Asia-Pacific region, the  Group's  sales  increased.  Growth  rates  in  Southeast  Asia were  particularly  high,  while  business  levels  rebounded  in Australia. Revenue posted solid growth in South Korea, which is now one of the Group's largest markets.\n\nIn the Rest of the World, excluding Eastern Europe, the Group posted excellent performance compared to both 2021 and 2019.\n\nStore footfall rebounded overall compared to 2021, although trends  varied  widely  between  regions.  Together  with  a  slight fall  in  the  conversion  rate  (i.e.  the  number  of  people  buying products  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  number  of  people visiting stores) resulted in a moderate increase in the number of items sold. As a result, revenue growth was driven to a large extent  by  an  increase  in  the  average  selling  price,  resulting from  the  policy  of  taking  the  Houses'  product  ranges  more upscale. The e-commerce business also continued to develop, but  growth  slowed  to  a  more  normal  11%  on  a  comparable basis  relative  to  2021  because  of  the  very  high  base  for comparison  (online  revenue  has  tripled  since  2019)  and  its existing penetration (15% of the retail channel in 2022).",

        "page_content": "Revenue from stores and e-commerce sites directly operated by the Group accounted for around 78% of the Group's total sales (before Eliminations) in 2022, similar to the figure seen in  2021.  The  increase  in  this  proportion  in  recent  years  has resulted  from  the  long-term  strategy  implemented  by  all Houses, which is aimed at controlling their distribution more effectively,  including  e-commerce,  and  making  them  more exclusive.\n\nWholesale  revenue  rose  4%  year-on-year  in  2022  on  a comparable  basis  (before  Eliminations).  For  the  Houses, Wholesale  revenue  fell  by  1%  on  a  comparable  basis.  This reflects  the  reorganization  of  the  wholesale  distribution network that is currently underway, through which the Group is  focusing  more  on  using  the  highest-quality  distributors.\n\nAlthough  these  streamlining  efforts  are  almost  complete  at Gucci - where the base for comparison has reverted to a more normal  level  -  they  are  continuing  in  the  Group's  other Couture and Leather Goods Houses. However, Kering Eyewear, which has a wholesale-only distribution model, posted one of the  Group's  strongest  growth  rates  (27%),  driven  both  by  the development  of  existing  licenses  and  the  integration  of Lindberg and Maui Jim.\n\nRoyalty revenue from licenses and other revenue rose by 30% on  a  comparable  basis  in  2022.  Royalties  received  in  the eyewear category rose sharply, continuing the strong momentum  seen  in  2021.  Royalties  in  the  Fragances  and Cosmetics category rebounded from a lower prior-year base.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Gucci                          | 3,732  | 3,715  | -        |\n| Yves Saint Laurent             | 1,019  | 715    | +43%     |\n| Bottega Veneta                 | 366    | 286    | +28%     |\n| Other Houses                   | 558    | 459    | +22%     |\n| Kering Eyewear and Corporate   | (88)   | (164)  | +46%     |\n| Eliminations                   | 2      | 6      | N/A      |\n| Recurring operating income (1) | 5,589  | 5,017  | +11%     |\n\nThe Group's recurring operating income  amounted  to \u20ac5,589  million  in  2022,  up  \u20ac572  million  or  11%  compared to  2021.  All  brands  contributed  to  the  increase  in  operating income in absolute terms.\n\nRecurring operating margin fell 0.9 points to 27.5% because of negative  operational  leverage  in  the  second  half  of  the  year, i.e. operating expenses rose more quickly than sales and gross margin.  This  meant  that  recurring  operating  margin  in  the second half of 2022 was 1.8 points lower than in the first half.\n\nGross margin rose 16% to \u20ac15,198 million. As a proportion of revenue,  gross  margin  was  74.7%,  up  0.6  points  relative  to 2021. The positive impact of higher average selling prices and the growing proportion of sales from directly operated stores more than offset the negative impact of inflation, changes in the  country  mix  and  the  combined  effect  of  exchange-rate movements and currency hedging results.\n\nOperating  expenses  rose  by  19%.  Excluding  currency  effects, this  increase  arose  from  investments  made  by  the  Group's brands and Kering Eyewear to support their development and expansion, notably by increasing budgets for store expenses, creation,  the  development  and  presentation  of  collections, communications  and  information  systems  in  line  with  the industry's  accelerating  digital  transformation.  These  efforts, which were necessary in view of the competitive environment and the upturn in business since the end of 2020, affected the brands'  profitability  to  varying  extents.  The  vast  majority  of the  Group's  Houses  benefited  from  a  favorable  operating leverage effect due to revenue growth. However, Gucci saw its operating margin fall by 2.6 points. Continuing the trend seen in  2021,  Gucci  considerably  increased  its  communications expenditure, taking it  to  a  more  normal  level  by  comparison with the industry average, and the cost of operating its stores and design studio also rose. While this expenditure will create value in the long term, it adversely affected Gucci's profitability in 2022 within a context of slowing sales growth, particularly in the second half of the year.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                                                                     | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Recurring operating income                                                                          | 5,589  | 5,017  | +11%     |\n| Net recurring charges to depreciation, amortization  and provisions on non-current operating assets | 1,666  | 1,453  | +15%     |\n| o/w depreciation of lease right-of-use assets                                                       | 935    | 827    | +13%     |\n| EBITDA (1)                                                                                          | 7,255  | 6,470  | +12%     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Between  2019  and  2022,  it  led  to  a very  substantial  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  revenue coming  from  the  wholesale  business.  This  meant  that  sales from  directly  operated  stores  made  up  91%  of  Gucci's  total sales in 2022.\n\nSales  from  stores  and  e-commerce  sites  controlled  by  the House  were  up  1%  on  a  comparable  basis  relative  to  2021. Revenue growth was 8% in the first half and 9% in the third quarter,  but  was  affected  in  the  fourth  quarter  by  the  weak Chinese market and a deterioration in US demand from a high base.  As  a  result,  retail  revenue  fell  by  15%  in  the  fourth quarter.\n\nIn  2022  as  a  whole,  the  main  driver  of  store-based  sales growth  was  the  increase  in  average  selling  prices  resulting from changes in the product mix to develop a more upscale product range.\n\nAfter several years of strong growth, e-commerce revenue was almost unchanged in 2022 on a comparable basis, because of this  distribution  channel's  exposure  to  the  American  market (where  it  accounts  for  almost  half  of  sales)  and  temporary difficulties  in  China,  where  lockdowns  hampered  normal logistics  operations.  However,  e-commerce  revenue  was  still three times the 2019 figure. E-commerce sales accounted for some 15% of total retail revenue in 2022.\n\nSince  the  streamlining  of  Gucci's  wholesale  distribution operations  was  almost  complete  by  the  end  of  2021, wholesale revenue was expected to be flat in 2022. This was indeed  the  case,  with  wholesale  revenue  being  almost identical  to  the  2021  figure  (at  comparable  exchange  rates), but down 39% relative to 2019.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn view of the proportion of Gucci's sales generated by directly operated stores, the following revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and online sales.\n\nIn Western Europe, the base for comparison was favorable in the first few months of the year and growth accelerated from the  second  quarter  onward  as  tourist  numbers  recovered, accordingly retail revenue rose by 47% on a comparable basis in  2022  as  a  whole.  The  sales  trend  among  local  customers remained  very  solid  overall,  resulting  from  the  House's investments  aimed  at  increasing  market  share  in  the  main European countries.\n\nIn Japan, consumer spending has strengthened since the end of 2021 and tourist numbers rebounded in late 2022, helping to drive a 19% increase in sales in 2022.\n\nIn North America, Gucci's revenue fell by 2%. That decline must be analyzed considering a very high base for comparison and developments  in  global  tourist  flows,  which  particularly affected business levels from the spring, and weaker demand among some customers in the United States. However, North American  revenue  remained  historically  high  and  was  63% higher  than  in  2019.  In  addition,  analyzing  sales  to  North American  customers  across  all  markets,  we  see  that  they increased relative to 2021 because of excellent sales to these customers in Western Europe.\n\nRevenue fell 14% in Asia-Pacific on a comparable basis. This decline was directly attributable to the Chinese market, where tough  measures  to  combat  the  COVID-19  pandemic  had  a major adverse impact on business levels from March onward. Outside China, sales in the region saw double-digit growth on a comparable basis, driven by rapid sales growth in Southeast Asia and a rebound in Australia.\n\nIn  the  world's  other  regions  except  Eastern  Europe,  revenue growth was very firm relative to 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue by product category\n\nIn 2022, sales of all Gucci's main product categories in directly operated stores were almost unchanged or very slightly higher compared  to  2021.  The  increase  in  average  selling  prices, resulting  both  from  changes  in  the  product  mix  and  price hikes, offset lower volumes.\n\nEfforts to enhance Gucci's offering and pricing structure went hand-in-hand  with  the  streamlining  of  its  distribution  and ongoing  changes  in  the  brand's  creative  and  aesthetic proposition. The aim is to elevate the brand and make it more exclusive.  In  this  way,  the  House  can  leverage  its  unique heritage while remaining resolutely contemporary and modern. Gucci's creative team - beyond of the Creative Director -  and merchandizing  team  are  working  ceaselessly  to  achieve  this balance,  with  an  ongoing  focus  on  maximizing  the  growth potential  of  each  product  category  by  adapting  the  overall offering  to  engage  with  the  widest  possible  range  of  clients, and optimizing the mix between carryovers and new products.\n\nLeather  Goods  sales  were  buoyed  by  successful  product launches and investments in improving the range of luggage and  travel  bags.  However,  the  deterioration  in  the  Chinese market had a negative impact on handbag sales.\n\nThe brand's other product categories saw fairly similar growth rates compared to 2021.\n\nRoyalty  revenue  rose  sharply  year-on-year.  The  eyewear category, managed by Kering Eyewear, continued to see rising sales, while royalties from the license granted to Coty for the Fragrances and Cosmetics category saw an improvement, from a fairly favorable base for comparison.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nGucci's recurring operating income amounted to \u20ac3,732 million for 2022, up \u20ac17 million year-on-year.\n\nRecurring operating margin was 35.6%, down 2.6 points.\n\nGiven Gucci's geographical exposure, the combination of currency effects and the result of currency hedging had a slight negative impact of around 0.4 points on recurring operating margin.\n\nAbove all, the brand continued to allocate more resources to clienteling activities, in-store events, communication campaigns and upgrades to digital platforms and information systems. It also  incurred  costs  in  relation  to  the  reorganization  of  its design studio, which was decided during the year.\n\nCompared  to  2021,  these  investments  were  concentrated  in the  first  half,  and  the  increase  in  operating  expenses  was limited in the second.\n\nGiven  the  sales  growth  trajectory  in  2022  and  particularly Gucci's fourth-quarter performance, operational leverage was particularly  unfavorable  in  the  second  half  of  the  year (i.e. expenses rose more quickly than revenue). The decline in operating margin relative to 2021 was 3.8 points in the second half  as  opposed  to  1.3  points  in  the  first  six  months  of  the year.\n\nGucci's EBITDA for 2022 stood at \u20ac4,416 million, an increase of \u20ac105  million  relative  to  2021  and  representing  an  EBITDA margin of 42.1%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Gucci operated 528 stores directly. Gucci opened 27 new stores during the year (net of closures), mainly in Asia and North America.\n\nIt  continued  to  prioritize  organic  growth  by  maximizing  the productivity  of  the  existing  store  network,  while  maintaining efforts to identify opportunities that will enable it to enhance its distribution in certain regions or sales channels.\n\nGucci's gross operating investments amounted to \u20ac408 million in 2022, 26% higher than in 2021, against a backdrop of rising prices  for  materials  and  building  work.  Gross  operating investments equaled 3.9% of revenue (3.3% in 2021), which is a relatively normal level for a House of Gucci's size.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  represents  growth  of 31% as reported and 23% on a comparable basis.\n\nIt was another year of rapid growth for the House, supporting its short-and medium-term revenue targets.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nRevenue from stores and e-commerce sites directly operated by  the  House  accounted  for  77%  of  the  total  and  rose  28% year-on-year  on  a  comparable  basis.  Same-store  growth accounted  for  most  of  this  figure,  with  the  vast  majority  of retail performance indicators showing an improvement, while online sales also posted very solid growth. Growth slowed to 7% in  the  retail  business  in  the  fourth  quarter,  but  this  was due  to  a  high  base  for  comparison:  relative  to  2019,  retail revenue was up 75%.\n\nWholesale  revenue  rose  by  6%  at  constant  exchange  rates relative to 2021. The wholesale channel remains strategically important for Yves Saint Laurent, as it perfectly complements its  retail  business.  However,  the  House  is  continuing  to  pay particular  attention  to  the  quality  and  exclusivity  of  its distribution  and  is  being  careful  to  focus  its  wholesale business on a limited number of distributors. The increase in sales  to  these  distributors  more  than  offset  the  negative impact  of  reducing  the  number  of  wholesale  accounts.  This streamlining of distribution is likely to continue in 2023.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn  view  of  the  proportion  of  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  sales generated  by  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and e-commerce sales.\n\nIn  2022,  Yves  Saint  Laurent  achieved  year-on-year  revenue growth  across  all  major  regions,  although  performance  in Asia-Pacific was obviously held back by China's anti-COVID-19 measures.  The  House  does  not  have  any  directly  operated stores in Russia.\n\nYear-on-year revenue growth was 84% in Western Europe and 21% in Japan on a comparable basis: the brand is popular with local  customers,  and  sales  were  also  driven  by  rising  tourist numbers, particularly in Europe.\n\nIn  North  America,  after  an  exceptional  2021  in  which  sales doubled  compared  to  2019,  growth  remained  very  strong  at 15%.  From  the  second  quarter  onward,  however,  growth  in North  America  slowed,  partly  because  of  the  high  base  for comparison  and  the  upturn  in  the  number  of  American tourists visiting Europe.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific,  revenue was up 8% on a comparable basis. It was adversely affected by lower sales in China, although Yves Saint  Laurent  is  proportionally  less  exposed  to  that  market than  many  other  players  in  the  Luxury  industry.  On  the  plus side, its momentum was excellent in Southeast Asia.\n\nYves Saint Laurent's performance in the Rest of the World was very solid, with growth of 30%, and particularly in the Middle East, which has historically been an important market for the brand.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nAll product categories registered sharp revenue rises compared to  2021  in  the  brand's  directly  operated  stores  and  online channel.\n\nLeather Goods remained the top category, with sales growth compared  to  2021  closely  aligned  with  the  House's  overall performance. This reflects  the  initiatives  taken  by  Yves  Saint Laurent  over  the  last  few  years  to  constantly  renew  and refresh its Leather Goods offering, which has helped it to both attract  new  customers  and  retain  existing  ones  in  all  its markets.\n\nSales of Ready-To-Wear collections for both women and men rose  very  sharply,  continuing  trends  seen  throughout  2021. This  performance  is  the  result  of  the  brand's  merchandizing strategy implemented over the past quarters with the aim of making  its  offerings  and  price  architecture  more  relevant  in this category.\n\nRevenue in the shoes category also rose at a very firm pace.\n\nRoyalty  revenue  generated  by  Kering  Eyewear  surged,  again showing  the  success  of  this  licensing  agreement.  Royalties paid  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  the  Fragrances  and  Cosmetics  category rebounded firmly after a more mixed 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Recurring operating income\n\nIn  2022,  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  recurring  operating  income totaled \u20ac1,019 million, an increase of 43%. Operating margin rose  above  the  30%  threshold,  coming  in  up  2.6  points year-on-year at 30.9%.\n\nThis further improvement is in line with the House's ambitions and  intended  growth  trajectory.  It  also  demonstrates  that Yves  Saint  Laurent  has  achieved  a  critical  size  enabling  it  to capitalize on its operating leverage while also allocating all the resources necessary for its short-and medium-term development, ranging  from  creating,  expanding  and  running  its  store network  to  leading  communication  campaigns  around  the brand.\n\nEBITDA  rose  by  \u20ac336  million  year-on-year  to  \u20ac1,251  million. As  a  result,  EBITDA  margin  was  37.9%  as  opposed  to  36.3% in 2021.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  House  operated  280  stores directly. There were 12 net store openings during 2022, as the brand  continued  the  store  network  expansion  plan  it  has implemented over the past few years.  Although  2022  clearly represented a return to normal in terms of growth in the store network,  the  House  still  has  the  potential  to  manage  a network  of  300-350  stores  in  the  medium  term.  This  target will drive the House's real-estate strategy in the next few years. Store  openings  in  2022  took  place  in  all  markets  in  which Yves Saint Laurent already had directly operated stores.\n\nThe  House's  operating  investments  totaled  \u20ac112  million,  up \u20ac40  million  compared  to  2021  and  up  \u20ac14  million  relative to  2019.  Investments  in  2022  were  heavily  focused  on  the second  half  of  the  year,  with  some  investments  relating  to large-scale projects due to be completed in 2023 or later. As a proportion of revenue, Yves Saint Laurent's operating investments were relatively normal at 3.4%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  House's  growth  since  2018  reflects  the  success  of  its strategy,  which  it  has  implemented  consistently  and  with determination,  aiming  to  develop  its  offerings  in  all  product categories,  rejuvenate  and  broaden  its  customer  base,  raise brand  awareness  -  especially  in  mature  markets  -  and enhance customers' in-store experience.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  brand's  exclusive,  high-end  positioning, the House is focusing on selling its products through directly operated  stores  and  e-commerce  sites,  which  accounted  for 78% of its revenue in 2022, as opposed to 75% in 2021.\n\nBottega  Veneta's  sales  in  directly  operated  stores  and e-commerce  sites  rose  by  15%  on  a  comparable  basis.  This growth was driven both by a healthy and controlled development of same-store sales and by good momentum in e-commerce. Comparative  figures  in  2021  may  affect  the  analysis  of performance in each quarter, but it is worth noting that growth in Bottega Veneta's retail sales was very steady in each quarter relative to 2019.\n\nAs  expected,  wholesale  revenue  was  stable  on  a  comparable basis.  After  two  years  in  which  Bottega  Veneta's  growing appeal enabled it to regain market share with its wholesalers, it  has now started to reorganize this distribution channel - a process that will continue in 2023 - with the aim of working only with a limited number of very high-quality partners.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nGiven  the  proportion  of  Bottega  Veneta's  sales  that  are generated  in  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue analysis by region only concerns retail and online sales.\n\nIn  Western  Europe,  revenue  rose  by  65%  on  a  comparable basis, driven both by the brand's success with local customers and by the upturn in the number of tourists visiting the region.\n\nIn  Japan,  sales  grew  36%  year-on-year  at  constant  exchange rates.  As  in  2021,  business  levels  in  Japan  showed  that  the House's  new  aesthetic  direction  and  broader  product  range are making it increasingly popular with local customers.\n\nIn  North  America,  Bottega  Veneta's  sales  rose  5%  on  a comparable basis  relative  to  2021  despite  the  high  base  for comparison.  In  the  United  States,  notably,  the  House  has doubled in scale since 2019.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific,  sales  fell  by  3%.  Bottega  Veneta  achieved  an excellent  performance  in  South  Korea,  which  is  very  similar market  to  Japan  in  terms  of  scale  and  the  House's  profile within  it,  and  Southeast  Asia,  but  this  did  not  entirely  offset the decline in sales in China.\n\nSales growth in the rest of the world remained robust.\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nLeather  Goods  once  again  constituted  the  brand's  core business,  making  up  75%  of  total  sales,  including  wholesale. Both new and iconic lines,  along  with  their  seasonal  variations, met with great success among the House's customer base. The House's  strategy  aims  to  maintain  the  exclusivity  associated with this key category of Leather Goods, particularly by focusing on sales growth through higher prices and an improved product mix rather than volume growth alone.\n\nReady-To-Wear  revenue  posted  very  solid  growth  as  new collections, both womenswear but also increasingly menswear, were very well received.\n\nThe sales trend in the shoes category, meanwhile, should be assessed in view of the very high base for comparison.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nBottega Veneta's recurring operating income for 2022 totaled \u20ac366 million, up 28% compared to 2021.\n\nOperating margin was again above 20% threshold, rising 1.9 points year-on-year  to  21.0%.  That  increase  was  driven  by  positive operating  leverage,  even  though  the  House  maintained  its investment efforts in order to make its revamp a lasting success. The increase in the cost base is therefore being well managed and priorities are being set regarding the allocation of resources to focus them on the most effective types of expenditure.\n\nEBITDA  amounted  to  \u20ac541  million  in  2022,  equal  to  31.1% of revenue.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  Bottega  Veneta  had  271  directly operated stores. There were 8 net store openings during the year.\n\nThe brand is focusing its investment efforts on relocating and refurbishing  its  existing  stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of gradual and targeted openings as opportunities arise, notably with the establishment of new flagships.\n\nOperating  investments  totaled  \u20ac92  million,  higher  than  in previous  years.  However,  they  remained  broadly  stable  as  a proportion of the House's sales (around 5%).",

However,  its  sales  still  rose because of its resilient distribution network in China and solid growth in new markets.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nRevenue  from  stores  and  websites  directly  operated  by  the Other  Houses  rose  by  27%  year-on-year  on  a  comparable basis.  That  growth  was  partly  due  to  new  store  openings  in line  with  the  strategy  of  moving  towards  more  exclusive distribution.  Same-store  sales  growth  was  also  very  solid\n\nalthough  it  varied  between  markets.  Continuously  increasing online sales provided another source of growth. However, the proportion  of  total  revenue  coming  from  online  sales  varied between brands, showing close correlation with the maturity of each House's e-commerce operation and product range.\n\nWholesale  revenue  fell  6%  on  a  comparable  basis.  In accordance  with  the  Group's  strategy,  the  Other  Houses  primarily Balenciaga - are focusing their wholesale businesses on a limited number of top-quality partners.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nThe  performances  by  region  delivered  by  the  Other  Houses followed  similar  trends  to  those  seen  at  Gucci,  Yves  Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.\n\nVery  firm  trends  in  spending  by  local  consumers  and  the recovery  in  tourism  also  supported  all  of  the  Other  Houses' sales  in  Western  Europe,  where  revenue  rose  by  25%  on  a comparable basis.\n\nRevenue grew 37% on a comparable basis in Japan, boosted in particular by the excellent performance of Jewelry brands.\n\nIn  North  America,  sales  growth  returned  to  a  more  normal level of 5% on a comparable basis. However, the Other Houses' sales in North America were more than double the level seen in 2019.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific,  revenue  growth  remained  solid  at  10%  on  a comparable  basis.  Like  the  industry  as  a  whole,  the  Other Houses  were  affected  by  the  COVID  policy  adopted  in  China, but  their  sales  held  up  well.  In  other  markets,  mainly Southeast Asia and Oceania, the Other Houses increased their revenue, showing their exceptional growth potential.\n\nIn  the  Rest  of  the  World  excluding  Russia,  the  Other  Houses were extremely robust.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  particular,  the  Leather  Goods offerings  of  Balenciaga  and  Alexander  McQueen,  which  have expanded in recent years, continued to attract new customers.\n\nRevenue  in  the  Ready-To-Wear  category  also  saw  very  firm growth due to good momentum at Balenciaga, an upturn at Brioni and Alexander McQueen's high level of credibility in this category.\n\nHowever,  the  shoes  category  suffered  from  a  very  high  base for comparison and more moderate demand from aspirational customers in certain markets.\n\nJewelry  Houses  continued  to  implement  their  development plans successfully in 2022, and  saw  sales  rise very substantially.  High  Jewelry  collections  from  Boucheron  but also Pomellato were particularly well received.\n\nRoyalties  increased  relative  to  2021,  due  in  particular  to  the very  strong  performance  of  licenses  managed  by  Kering Eyewear.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe Other Houses' recurring operating income was \u20ac558 million in 2022, 22% higher than in 2021.\n\nRecurring  operating  margin  came  to  14.4%,  up  0.3  points compared to 2021.\n\n- 84\n\nThis slight increase was down to the Other Houses' excellent performance  in  the  first  half  and  the  positive  operational leverage that resulted. In the second half, however, profitability was lower because of expenditure on strengthening the Houses' organizations and supporting their development in all their main markets, while sales growth returned to a more normal level.\n\nThe deconsolidation of watch brands following their disposal also boosted the segment's operating margin.\n\nEBITDA is at \u20ac888 million, an increase of increased \u20ac154 million year-on-year. This drove EBITDA margin 0.5 points higher to 22.9%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe  Other  Houses  had  580  directly  operated  stores  as  of December 31, 2022, a net increase of 53 compared to 2021.\n\nBalenciaga and the other Jewelry brands were mainly behind this  expansion  of  the  network.  Asia-Pacific  had  most  store openings  (net  of  closures),  followed  by  North  America  and Western Europe, which saw almost equal numbers of openings.\n\nThese developments naturally led to an increase in the Other Houses'  operating  investments,  which  totaled  \u20ac221  million, \u20ac41  million  more  than  in  2021.  As  a  proportion  of  annual revenue,  investments  remained  high  at  5.7%  in  2022  as opposed  to  5.5%  in  2021.  Although  the  Houses  obviously worked  on  strengthening  their  retail  operations,  they  also invested in their production capabilities and the full array of infrastructure need to develop their businesses.",

KGS - the Kering entity that handled sourcing activities for non-Group brands including companies making up the former Redcats group - was sold in November 2022. The operating income it generated  in  2022,  during  the  period  of  almost 11 months when it remained part of the Group, is included in the \"Corporate and other\" sub-segment.\n\nIn 2022, the segment generated total revenue of \u20ac1,139 million, including \u20ac1,115 million from Kering Eyewear.\n\nKering Eyewear's sales were up 58% as reported. They included a positive impact from a change in scope, resulting from the consolidation of Lindberg from October 1, 2021 and Maui Jim from October 1, 2022.\n\nAt  constant  scope  and  exchange rates, revenue rose by 27%, with  the  number  of  licenses  managed  by  Kering  Eyewear remaining stable relative to 2021. Performance in the first and second  halves  of  the  year  must  be  analyzed  in  view  of seasonal  variations  in  Kering  Eyewear's  business,  with  more sales taking place in the first six months.\n\nGrowth at constant scope was extremely solid in all its main markets, except China.\n\nIn  terms  of  the  distribution  channels  of  brands  managed under license by Kering Eyewear, local chains and the \"three Os\" (opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists) constitute the main sales channel (representing over 50% of total sales in both 2022 and 2021). Revenue from those distributors once again  saw  very  robust  growth,  showing  the  effectiveness  of Kering  Eyewear's  sales  organization.  Business  levels  in  the other distribution channels rose sharply and even rebounded in Travel Retail, where sales doubled year-on-year.\n\nThe  segment  made  an  operating  loss  of  \u20ac88  million, comprising  operating  income  of  \u20ac203  million  at  Kering Eyewear less Corporate operating expenses of \u20ac291 million.\n\nKering  Eyewear's  recurring  operating  margin  was  18.2%, around 6.5 points more than in 2021. That increase resulted from positive operating leverage but also the accretive nature of the Lindberg and Maui Jim acquisitions.\n\nCorporate operating expenses rose by \u20ac45 million compared to 2021. Excluding an adverse currency effect, the increase in costs related mainly to the Group's IT, digital and innovation initiatives, as well as the effects of inflation, which particularly affected payroll expenses. In addition, expenses had remained at a particularly low level in 2021 after a massive decrease in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its height. Relative to  2019,  therefore,  the  increase  in  corporate  operating expenses was limited to 4% as reported.\n\nThe segment's operating investments amounted to \u20ac238 million in 2022, down \u20ac53 million relative to 2021. Investment peaked in  2020  and  remained very high in 2021, in connection with efforts to modernize all IT systems and the logistics organization that Corporate manages on behalf of the Group's brands.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This new target  covering  scopes  1,  2  and  3  of  the  greenhouse  gas protocol  was  revealed  ahead  of  the  publication  of  Kering's 2020-2023  Sustainability  Progress  Report  on  22  March,  six years into the Group's 'Crafting Tomorrow's Luxury' strategy.\n\nKering's new  40%  reduction  target  in  absolute  terms represents the next necessary  step  to  accelerate  the\n\n## 8 OUTLOOK\n\nTo  achieve  its  long-term  vision,  Kering  invests  in  the development  of  its  Houses,  so  that  they  continuously strengthen  their  desirability  and  the  exclusivity  of  their distribution, strike a perfect balance  between  creative innovation  and  timelessness,  and  achieve  the  highest standards  in  terms  of  quality,  sustainability,  and  experience for their customers.\n\nIn  an  environment  of  ongoing  economic  and  geopolitical uncertainty in the near term, Kering will continue to execute on its strategy and vision, in pursuit of two key ambitions: to maintain  a  trajectory  of  profitable  growth  resulting  in  high levels of cash flow generation and return on capital employed, and to confirm its status as one of the most influential groups in the Luxury industry.\n\n## 9 DEFINITIONS OF NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INDICATORS\n\n## 'Reported' and 'comparable' growth\n\nThe  Group's  'reported'  growth  corresponds  to  the  change  in reported revenue between two periods.\n\nThe Group measures \"comparable\" growth (also referred to as 'organic'  growth)  in  its  business  by  comparing  revenue between two periods at constant scope and exchange rates.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues  and expenses  directly  related  to  its  activities,  whether  these revenues  and  expenses  are  recurring  or  arise  from  nonrecurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the  assessment  of  the  Group's  operating  performance  as reflected  in  its  recurring  operating  income.  They  include changes in scope, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where  material,  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible  assets,  capital  gains  and  losses  on  disposals  of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\n\nChanges  in  scope  are  dealt  with  as  follows  for  the  periods concerned:\n\n- \u00b7 the  portion  of  revenue  relating  to  acquired  entities  is excluded from the current period;\n- \u00b7 the portion relating to entities divested or in the process of being divested is excluded from the previous period.\n\nCurrency effects are calculated by applying the average exchange rates for the current period to amounts in the previous period.\n\n'Recurring  operating  income'  is  therefore  an  alternative performance indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This indicator is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring  performance.  It  is  presented  in  a  manner  that  is consistent  and  stable  over  the  long  term  in  order  to  ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.\n\nimplementation  of  the  Group's  vision  of  a  modern  and responsible  luxury,  complementing  the  evolution  of  its sustainability  strategy.  Over  the  last  three  years,  Kering  not only  continued  to  make  significant  strides  towards  attaining its  original  social  and  environmental  2025  targets,  but  also augmented them through a series of ambitious new targets. Under  dedicated  strategies  for  climate,  biodiversity  and circularity, these additional goals, combined with Kering's new absolute  target  and  its  historical  objectives,  will  continue  to drive the transformation of the Group's business model.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  financial  indicator corresponds  to  recurring  operating  income  plus  net  charges  to  depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions  on  non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.\n\n## Free cash flow from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow\n\nThe  Group  uses  an  intermediate  line  item,  'Free  cash  flow from  operations',  to  monitor  its  financial  performance.  This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).\n\nThe Group has also defined a new indicator, 'Available cash flow from  operations',  in  order  to  take  into  account  capitalized fixed  lease  payments  (repayments  of  principal  and  interest) pursuant  to  IFRS  16,  and  thereby  reflect  all  of  its  operating cash flows.\n\n\"Available  cash  flow\"  therefore  corresponds  to  available  cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Lease liabilities are not included in the calculation of this indicator. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests.\n\nThe cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including the impact of derivative  instruments  used  to  hedge  the  fair  value  of borrowings.\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  on  recurring  income  corresponds  to  the  effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating  to  other non-recurring operating income and expenses.\n\n## 10 INVESTMENT POLICY\n\nKering's investment policy is designed to support and enhance the Group's growth potential in its markets and is focused on financial investments and investments related to operations.\n\nFinancial investments reflect the Group's strategy of reinforcing  profitable  high-growth  activities  in  the  luxury market  by  acquiring  attractive  brands  with  strong  growth potential  and  market  positions  that  complement  its  existing assets.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nFinancial  investments  represented  net  cash  outflows  of \u20ac2,770  million  in  2022,  relating  mainly  to  the  acquisition  of Maui Jim (compared to \u20ac452 million of net cash outflows for 2021, mainly reflecting the acquisition of Lindberg).\n\nThe  cash  impact  of  discontinued  operations  (mainly  GirardPerregaux  and  Ulysse  Nardin)  restated  in  accordance  with\n\n- 88\n\nOperating  investments  are  designed  to  accelerate  organic growth  for  the  Group's  brands.  This  is  achieved  by,  for example, developing and renovating the store network and by investing in logistics centers and IT systems.\n\nIFRS  5  is  shown  in  the  'Net  cash  received  from  (used  in) discontinued operations' item (Chapter 6 -Financial statements  as  of  December  31,  2022  -  1.5  consolidated statement of cash flows) and represented a net cash outflow of  \u20ac8  million  in  2022  (compared  to  net  cash  outflow  of  \u20ac2 million in 2021).",

        "page_content": "## Operating investments\n\nThe Group conducts a targeted investment policy designed to reinforce  both  its  image  and  the  unique  positioning  of  its Houses, as well as to increase its return on capital employed.\n\nThe Group's investment policy is focused on the development of  its  store  network,  the  conversion  and  renovation  of  its existing points of sale, the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing units in the luxury sector, and the development of  IT  systems.  Gross  operating  investments  amounted  to \u20ac1,071 million in 2022, up 15% or \u20ac137 million relative to 2021. The seasonality of operating investments was very similar to the pattern seen in 2021, with a large majority of investments (almost two thirds) taking place in the second\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group had a network of 1,659 directly  operated  stores.  Net  store  additions  compared  to December  31,  2021  totaled  100.  A  large  proportion  (almost 40%)  of  the  new  store  openings  were  in  the  Asia-Pacific region,  but  some  brands  also  expanded  their  distribution networks with openings in Japan, North America and Western Europe.  The  year-on-year  increase  was  also  driven  to  a  very large extent by the scheduled expansion of the Balenciaga and Yves  Saint  Laurent  networks  and  completion  of  efforts  to streamline Gucci's distribution.\n\n## Gucci\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Gucci operated 528 stores directly. Gucci  opened  27  net  new  stores  during  the  year,  mainly  in Asia-Pacific.  Gucci's  focus  is  on  achieving  organic  growth  by maximizing the productivity of the existing store network, but it is also continuing to identify opportunities that will enable it to  enhance  its  distribution  in  certain  regions  or  sales channels.\n\nGucci's gross operating investments amounted to \u20ac408 million in  2022,  26%  more  than  in  2021.  Those  investments  were split  fairly  evenly  between  refurbishments,  openings  and relocations  on  the  one  hand,  and  projects  related  to  the supply chain, digital and support functions on the other.\n\n## Yves Saint Laurent\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the House had 280 directly operated stores.  There  were  12  net  store  openings  during  2022, reflecting the brand's store network expansion plan implemented over the past few years. New stores were opened during the year in all the markets in which Yves Saint Laurent already  operates  directly.  Although  growth  in  the  number  of stores  clearly  reverted  to  a  more  normal  level  in  2022,  the House nonetheless has the potential to manage a network of 300 to 350 stores in the medium term.\n\nThe  House's  operating  investments  totaled  \u20ac112  million,  up \u20ac40 million relative to 2021.\n\n## Bottega Veneta\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  Bottega  Veneta  had  271  directly operated stores. There were 8 net store openings during the year. As in 2021, the brand focused its investment efforts on relocating and refurbishing its existing stores, while pursuing its strategy of gradual and targeted openings as opportunities arose, notably with the establishment of new flagships.\n\nOperating  investments  totaled  \u20ac92  million  in  2022,  higher than in 2021 but broadly stable as a proportion of the House's sales (roughly 5%).\n\n## Other Houses\n\nThe Other Houses directly operated 580 stores as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 53 year-on-year. This rise was mainly attributable  to  store  openings  by  Balenciaga  and  Alexander McQueen. Another key development was the expansion of the Jewelry  Houses'  store  network,  with  new  openings  again focused in Asia.\n\nThese developments led to an increase in the Other Houses' operating investments, which totaled \u20ac221 million, \u20ac41 million higher than in 2021.\n\n## Kering Eyewear and Corporate\n\nInvestments  by  Kering  Eyewear  and  Corporate  totaled \u20ac238  million.  They  were  \u20ac53  million  lower  than  in  2021. Investment peaked in 2020 and remained very high in 2021, in tandem  with  efforts  to  modernize  all  IT  systems  and  the logistics organization that Corporate manages on behalf of the Group's  brands.  Expenditure  relating  to  major  strategic programs coordinated  by  the  Group  (e.g.,  the  deployment  of SAP  and  a  new  logistics  hub  in  Italy)  were  to  a  large  extent concentrated in the previous three financial years. As a result, Kering Eyewear and Corporate's share of the Group's operating investments fell from 31% to 22%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  notably  describes membership  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  application  of  the principle of balanced representation of women and men on the Board,  the  conditions  of  preparation  and  organization  of  its work, compliance with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies to which the Company\n\nrefers,  and  the  remuneration  policy  for  corporate  officers  laid down  by  the  Board.  In  addition,  this  report  indicates  any potential limitations set by the Board on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director of the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the full report, including the remuneration policy for corporate officers,  at  its  meeting  on March  2,  2023  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Articles L. 225-37 and L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## 1.1 Reference Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations resulting from the October 2003 consolidation of the  AFEP  and  MEDEF  reports,  the  January  2007  and  October 2008 AFEP-MEDEF recommendations on the remuneration of executive corporate officers, the April 2010 recommendations on strengthening the representation of women on boards, the June  2013  recommendations  on  Say-on-Pay  shareholder votes,  stricter  'comply  or  explain'  requirements  and  the establishment of the High Committee on Corporate\n\nGovernance  ( Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  Gouvernement  d'Entreprise ), the  November  2016  recommendations  relating  in  particular to  independence,  CSR  and  the  remuneration  of  executive corporate  officers,  the  June  2018  recommendations  relating notably to the tasks of the Board of Directors, as amended on January 30, 2020 and their December 2022 recommendations on  the  Board's  role  as  the  guardian  of  the  company's  CSR strategy (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code').\n\n## 1.2 Combination of executive management roles\n\nIn 2005, PPR adopted a governance structure with a Board of Directors, which appointed Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFollowing discussions within the Appointments Committee, the Board elected to combine the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  to  renew  this  choice  after  the Combined  General  Meeting  of  June  18,  2013,  when  the shareholders decided to reappoint Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as a Director,  considering  that  this  arrangement  was  more  in  tune with  Kering's  specific  characteristics.  The  decision  to  combine the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer was  considered  best  suited  to  the  Group's  organization, operating  procedures  and  activities.  Following  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors confirmed  its  decision  to  appoint  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  its  decision,  the  Board,  in  particular,  had  regard  to  the special position of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault who is related to the controlling shareholder and  his active involvement  in conducting  the  Group's  business  affairs,  of  which  he  has  indepth  operational  knowledge  and  extensive  experience.  The\n\n- 92\n\nBoard  also  underlined  the  benefits  of  combining  executive management roles following the Group's transformation drive on  the  grounds  that  this  makes  for  an  effective  strategic decision-making  process,  helps  to  optimize  the  Group's economic  and  financial  performance,  and  provides  strong, consistent communication.\n\nThis arrangement is also aligned with the Group's shareholder structure,  which  includes  individual  investors,  a  controlling shareholder and institutional shareholders, all of whom have a stake in Kering's long-term development.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pinault, founder of the Group, is Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors, but is not a Director.\n\nIn addition, given that the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are combined and to provide additional assurance  with  regard  to  the  Board's  operating  rules  and balance  of  power,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  at  its meeting on February 11, 2019, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, to create the role of  Lead  Independent  Director,  with  the  duties  described  in section 1.5 of this chapter, as well as in the Board of Directors' Internal Rules.",

At  the  Combined General Meetings of June 18, 2013, April 27, 2017 and April 22, 2021, the shareholders decided to reappoint him as a Director for four years. At their meetings held subsequent to each of the Combined General Meetings, the Board of Directors also decided to  reappoint  him  as  Group  Managing  Director  for  the  same period, acting on a recommendation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAlongside the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Group Managing  Director  is  directly  responsible  for  operations  at several  of  Kering's  Houses  and  participates  actively  in formulating the Group's overall strategy.\n\nIn his capacity as Group Managing Director and in compliance with  the  authorizations  expressly  granted  to  the  Group Managing Director by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Company's  Articles  of  Association,  the  Board  has  granted Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Palus  the  same  powers  to  represent  and  bind the  Company vis-\u00e0-vis  third  parties  as  those  conferred  upon the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 1.4 Balance of power on the Board of Directors\n\nWith a view to achieving and maintaining an effective balance of  power  on  its  Board,  the  Group  takes  steps  to  ensure  that membership is suitably balanced and diverse. Members of the Board  have  backgrounds  in  a  variety  of  industries  and  are mainly independent (six out of the eleven Board members, not counting  the  Directors  representing  employees,  or  55%), including the Lead Independent Director. As of March 2, 2023, five of the Board's thirteen members are women (a percentage of 45% calculated excluding the Directors representing employees in accordance with Article L. 225-27 of the French Commercial Code). This demonstrates that women are well represented on the  Board  of  Directors,  with  a  proportion  in  line  with  the requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  which  states that at least 40% of Board members must be women.\n\nThe operating rules and procedures of the Board of Directors are defined by law and the Company's Articles of Association, along  with  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  and  its  four specialized Committees, as presented in section 2.3.3 of this chapter:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee;\n- \u00b7 Appointments and Governance Committee;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe specific provisions of the Company's  Articles of Association  regarding  Directors  are  in  line  with  basic  legal requirements.  There  are  special  provisions  for  the  term  of office  of  Directors  (four  years,  renewable),  the  age  limit  (no more  than  one  third  of  the  Directors  may  be  over  70),  the Directors  representing  employees (one appointed by Kering's Social  and  Economic  Committee  and  the  other  by  the European Works Council) and the minimum number of shares (50) that must be owned by each Director, except the Directors representing employees, in accordance with Article L. 225-25 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn order to ensure a smooth renewal process for membership of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  shareholders  decided  at  the Combined  General  Meeting  of  May  7,  2009  to  stagger reappointments of Directors.\n\nDirectors are expected to attend meetings and be fully committed to the work of the Board and its Committees, which benefit from the diverse backgrounds, skills and expertise of their members.\n\nDirectors with in-depth, long-standing knowledge of the Group are a perfect complement to newly appointed Directors, who bring a fresh perspective on the Group and help it move forward.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal provisions governing the authorizations that must be granted by the Board (related-party agreements, endorsements,  suretyships  and  guarantees,  divestments  of shareholdings  or  sale  of  real  estate,  etc.),  Article  15  of  the Company's  Articles  of  Association  states  that  the  following decisions require the prior approval of the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 matters and transactions that have a substantive effect on the strategy of the Company or more generally of the Group, its financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- \u00b7 except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual  General Meeting, issues of securities of all types, that are liable to cause a change in the share capital;\n- \u00b7 the  following  transactions  by  Kering  SA  or  by  any  entity controlled  by  the  Group,  insofar  as  they  each  exceed \u20ac500 million, an amount set annually by the Board of Directors:\n- - all investments or divestments, including the acquisition, sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all  existing  or  future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Group real estate.\n\nThe  internal  rules  of  the  Board  provide  that  Directors  must inform  the  Board  of  any  existing  or  potential  conflict  of interest with Kering SA or any other Group company, and must not  attend  deliberations  of  or  vote  on  any  matters  that concern  them  directly  or  indirectly.  Each  year,  the  Board  of Directors  assesses  the  position  of  the  Directors  with  regard to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe internal rules are revised on a regular basis to bring them into line with changes in governance rules and practices. The latest changes to date are presented in detail in section 2.2.1 of this chapter.\n\nThe  internal  rules  are  published  in  full  on  the  Company's website.\n\nAs indicated above, each Committee has its own internal rules, which are updated on a regular basis. The most recent update concerned  the  internal  rules  of  the  Audit  Committee,  which now include rules for the approval of non-audit services that may be provided by Statutory Auditors or their networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each year, the Board also organizes a discussion on its work. This annual assessment by the Board concerns its membership, organization and operating rules. It takes place in two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 a questionnaire is issued to each Director;\n- \u00b7 each Director meets with the Chairman of the Board or the Lead  Independent  Director  or  a  person  designated  by  the Chairman, using the questionnaire as the starting point for discussions.\n\nTo  ensure  the  balance  of  power  among  the  Company's governance  bodies,  meetings  are  organized  without  the executive corporate officers at least once a year, in line with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nIn addition, the Company is holding more and more meetings with  its  shareholders  at  the  initiative  of  its  Board  of  Directors in  order  to  promote  long-term  value  creation  and  establish and maintain dialogue on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. It is also meeting more regularly with all its other stakeholders.\n\nThe  conditions  of  preparation  and  organization  of  the  work of  the  Board of Directors are described in section 2.2 of this chapter.\n\nAt the end of these meetings, the Directors set new objectives for improving the quality of their organization and ensure that all important issues have been suitably prepared and addressed.\n\n## 1.5 Role and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director\n\n## 1.5.1 Presentation of the Lead Independent Director\n\nIn  light  of  changes  to  the  membership  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  following  a  discussion  with  the  Company's shareholders in late  2018,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to include  a  Lead  Independent  Director  in  its  membership  to provide  additional  assurance  with  regard  to  the  Board's operating rules and balance of power.\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors created at its meeting  on  February  11,  2019  the  position  of  Lead Independent Director and appointed Sophie L'H\u00e9lias to serve in that role.\n\nAt  the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  of  March  4,  2022,  Sophie L'H\u00e9lias  announced  her  resignation  from  her  position  as director on Kering's Board owing to her recent appointment as Chairwoman of the Board of Directors of a company outside the Group.\n\nFollowing the appointment of V\u00e9ronique Weill at the Annual General  Meeting  of  April  28,  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors appointed her as the Lead Independent Director. She brings to Kering's Board of Directors her extensive experience, particularly in corporate governance.\n\n## 1.5.2 Lead Independent Director's responsibilities and powers\n\n## Organization of the work of the Board of Directors and relationship with Directors\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 is consulted on the agenda and schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman;\n- \u00b7 liaises  between  the  independent  Directors,  other  Board members  and  Executive  Management.  This  includes maintaining  regular,  open  dialogue  with  each  of  the Directors,  particularly  with  the  independent  Directors,  and organizing  at  least  one  meeting  per  year  without  the executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 prevents  conflicts  of  interest,  notably  by  bringing  to  the Board's attention any  potential  conflicts of interest identified  involving  executive  corporate  officers  or  other Board members;\n- \u00b7 ensures  compliance  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  internal rules;\n- \u00b7 participates  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nA  loss  of  independent  status  would  immediately  put  an  end to the Director's role as Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director's responsibilities are described in the internal regulations of the Board of Directors.",

She also  met  with  members  of  the  legal,  human  resources, investor relations, finance and sustainability teams, as well as several operating teams.\n\nDuring 2022, she notably:\n\n- \u00b7 met regularly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director;\n- \u00b7 participated in the preparation of meeting agendas for the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 contributed to dialogue with the Company's main shareholders, by meeting during the ESG roadshow held in November  2022  with  key  investors  representing  around 38.6%  of  the  free  float  (and  21.8%  of  total  share  capital).

The  experience  and  broadranging  expertise  of  Jean-Pierre  Denis,  a  member  of  Kering's Audit  Committee  since  2008  and  of  the  Sustainability Committee  since  2020,  can  be  relied  on  to  ensure  internal control  and  risk  management  procedures  are  implemented within  the  Group.

In  addition,  the annual meeting concerning the Group's strategy will in 2023 include in its agenda the setting of the Group's multi-annual CSR strategy, with a clear focus on the climate and targets set for different time horizons.\n\n## 1.7 Dialogue with Executive Management and operational divisions\n\nThe Directors can take up matters with Executive Management at  any  time  and  with  complete  transparency,  and  Executive Management  keeps  the  Directors  regularly  informed  of  all important events concerning the Company's business affairs. The Board has the resources to freely discuss all matters that concern it, particularly issues relating to the Group's strategic direction,  the  implementation  of  that  direction  and  its monitoring. The Directors are also provided in advance with all of  the  information  they  need  to  make  free  and  informed decisions  and  participate  in  developing  the  agendas  for  the meetings in conjunction with Executive Management.\n\nThe  Board  may  also  call  on  any  advisors  or  consultants  to obtain an independent expert opinion on any topics presented to it by the Company.\n\nThe  Board  can  meet  with  Group  senior  executives  at  certain meetings of the Board of Directors or its Committees.\n\n- 96\n\nEach  Director  is  also  entitled,  if  they  so  wish,  to  meet  the Group's senior executives outside these meetings in order to gain  a  better  insight  into  the  Group's  businesses  or  certain operational issues.\n\nThe  Board's  membership  and  modus  operandi  guarantee  it always acts  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Group.  It  serves  as  a forum for reflection providing invaluable support for Executive Management and ensures the interests of all stakeholders are protected.\n\nAs  part  of  the  regular  procedure  for  reviewing  agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and at arm's length,  as  described  in  section  2.2.1  of  this  chapter,  the Directors  may  consult  the  Legal  Department  and,  where necessary, the Finance Department from time to time.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 Conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.2.1 Duties of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors performs the duties and exercises the powers  granted  to  it  by  law  and  the  Company's  Articles  of Association.\n\nIt  determines  and  assesses  the  strategic  direction,  objectives and performance of the Company  and  ensures  their implementation.  Subject  to  the  powers  expressly  granted  to Annual General Meetings and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board reviews all issues concerning the smooth running of the Company and acts on all matters over which it has authority.\n\nThe Board carries out the controls and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nIn  compliance  with  AMF  recommendation  no.  2012-05,  the Board  has  adopted  internal  guidelines  on  the  identification, control and evaluation of related-party and ordinary agreements  to  ensure  that  agreements  entered  into  in  the ordinary course of business and at arm's length actually meet the required criteria, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  addition  to  reiterating  the  regulations  applicable  to  the identification and classification of related-party and ordinary agreements (notably by the Company's Legal Department, with the assistance, where necessary, of the Finance Department), the  guidelines  also  provide  for  the  regular  control  and evaluation  of  related-party  and  ordinary  agreements  by  the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Anyone directly or indirectly involved in an agreement cannot participate in its evaluation.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the  Board  of  Directors  are  defined  by  law,  the  Company's Articles of Association, the internal rules of the Board and the work of its specialized Committees. The Board has established internal rules for each Committee.\n\nUnder  its  internal  rules  and  by  law,  the  Board  of  Directors meets at least four times a year. To allow Directors to prepare as  effectively  as  possible  for  the  topics  to  be  considered during the meeting, a comprehensive information pack is sent to  them  in  due  time  ahead  of  the  meeting;  it  includes  the necessary  information  on  all  items  on  the  agenda.  These documents  are  made  available  to  the  Directors  on  a collaborative platform specially set up for Board members so that documents can be shared securely.\n\nIn line with the relevant regulatory requirements, the internal rules  also  set  the  rules  applicable  to  Directors  in  relation  to restrictions  on  trading  in  the  securities  of  the  Company, or more generally the Group, by establishing black-out periods. To this end:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors must refrain from trading directly or indirectly in the  listed  securities  and  financial  instruments  of  the Company and the Group for a period of 30 calendar days preceding each of the periodic publications relating to the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements and 15 calendar days preceding each of the quarterly publications relating to consolidated revenue and ending at the close of the trading day following the publication of the relevant  official  press  release.  In  no  way  does  this black-out period replace the legal and regulatory provisions regarding  insider  trading  with  which  each  member  of  the Board  must  comply  at  the  time  they  decide  to  trade,  no matter when this might occur outside the defined black-out periods;\n- \u00b7 the same obligations apply to each Director insofar as they have  knowledge  of  inside  information.  In  compliance  with current regulations, the internal rules also require Directors to declare trading in these securities.\n\nThe internal rules set the frequency and conditions of Board meetings and provide for meeting participation by videoconference and/or conference call.\n\nThey also establish the principle of regular assessment of the Board's  operating  rules  and  set  the  terms  and  conditions  for allocating the annual remuneration for Directors' activities.\n\nAccording  to  the  internal  rules,  Directors  are  required  to  inform the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  any  conflicts  of  interest,  even potential conflicts, between their duties to the Company and their  private  interests  and/or  other  duties,  and  they  may  not vote on any matters that concern them directly or indirectly.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors may ask the Directors at any time for a written statement confirming that they do not face any conflicts of interest.\n\nTo  make  its  operating  procedures  more  effective  and  in  the interests of good governance, the internal rules of the Board of  Directors  set  forth  and  formally  lay  down  the  rules governing  the  organization  and  operating  procedures  of  the Board as well as the role of its four specialized Committees: the  Audit  Committee,  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the Appointments and Governance Committee, and the Sustainability Committee.\n\nExecutive Management may in all circumstances be invited to attend these Committee meetings.\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  are published in full on the Company's website, were updated and approved at the Board meeting of February 16, 2021 to reflect the  amendments  to  the  Articles  of  Association  approved  by the Annual General Meeting of June 16, 2020 concerning: i) the remit  and  powers  of  the  Board  in  view  of  social  and environmental  issues,  ii)  a  new  section  concerning  the  Lead Independent  Director,  including  their  remit  and  powers,  and special  remuneration,  iii)  the  reduction  in  the  number  of shares that Directors must hold; and iv) the removal of the role of non-voting director (censor).\n\n## Board's commitment to non-financial performance\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures the strategic direction of the Company  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  its  corporate interests,  while  paying  close  attention  to  the  social  and environmental  issues  linked  to  its  activities.  The  four specialized Board Committees play a role in formulating and monitoring the non-financial strategy. Each operates within its respective area of expertise, while coordinating their activities to  provide  a  cross-disciplinary  approach  to  CSR  issues,  as described below.\n\n## Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 ensures  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk management systems in the Group;\n- \u00b7 ensures  it  is  aware  of  the  sustainable  development  and environmental protection policies implemented within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  coordination  with  the  various  Committees,  the Climate  Change  Lead  ensures  that  climate  issues  are addressed as part of a long-term approach.\n\nIn addition, Kering created in 2022 a department focused on Sustainable Finance. Its mission includes:\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing non-financial performance (social and environmental), which  helps  with  financial planning relating to energy transition and the decarbonization of the Group's business;\n- \u00b7 ensuring  that  the  Group  complies  with  the  current  and future non-financial reporting and green finance regulatory framework; and\n- \u00b7 ensuring that social and environmental issues are addressed  in  the  Group's  management  and  decisionmaking  processes,  particularly  regarding  investments  and M&A.\n\n## Gender diversity policy for the Group's senior management bodies\n\nThe  Board  sets  gender  diversity  targets  for  the  Group's management  bodies,  on  the  recommendation  of  Executive Management. The diversity principles applied to membership of the Board of Directors are also applied more broadly across the  Group  via  a  gender  diversity  policy  for  its  management bodies. Pursuant to this policy, as of the date of this Report on corporate governance, the Executive Committee includes five women out of a total of thirteen members, i.e. more than onethird are women.\n\nThe  establishment  in  2019  of  a  Diversity  and  Inclusion Department marked a new milestone in Kering's commitment\n\nto  accelerating  and  expanding  its  actions  in  support  of diversity, equality and inclusion -in the broadest sense of the term. In addition, in line with the Group's 2025 sustainability strategy, a diversity in the workforce criterion, with a particular emphasis on achieving gender balance, is incorporated in the process of determining the annual and multi-annual variable remuneration  of  the  Group's  executive  corporate  officers. These criteria are described in section 4 of this chapter.\n\nGoing  further  than  its  commitment  to  social  responsibility, the  Group  believes  that  diversity  and  inclusion  are  a  source of  creativity  and  innovation,  and  as  such  of  economic performance.  This  is  why  Kering  makes  every  effort  to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization.\n\nKering has defined and put in place an action plan to achieve a balanced  gender  mix  -  especially  within  the  Group's  senior management  (Top  450  roles)  -  by  2025.  This  will  notably involve:\n\n- \u00b7 measuring the representation of women in talent pools and succession plans;\n- \u00b7 integrating gender equality in the recruitment process;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  promotions  within  the  Group  by  gender  and management level;\n- \u00b7 measuring  gender  parity  at  each  management  level  on  a quarterly  basis  in  all  the  Group's  Houses  using  key indicators.\n\nEfforts made to achieve these objectives include:\n\n- \u00b7 encouraging participation in women's leadership programs;\n- \u00b7 introducing  a  mentoring  program  for  women  at  the international level;\n- \u00b7 developing an employee training program;\n- \u00b7 implementing a global parental policy;\n- \u00b7 giving  women  a  voice  via  the  Diversity  &  Inclusion Committees put in place at all of the Group's Houses.\n\n## 2.2.2 Principles relating to membership of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  regularly  reflects  upon  the  desirable balance of its membership and that of the specialized Committees, particularly  in  terms  of  diversity  (gender  representation, nationality, age, qualifications, professional experience, etc.).\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial Code and the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the table below describes the diversity policy applied to members of  the  Board  of  Directors.  It  indicates  the  criteria  taken  into consideration, the objectives set by the Board, the measures implemented and the results achieved during 2022.",

In addition, the Directors have significant international experience and exposure, as they hold, or have held, positions or directorships in international companies or key positions outside France.\n\n## Selection process for Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  pays  particular  attention  to  the selection of its members. In addition to their ability to act in the interest of all shareholders, the Directors are also chosen for  their  expertise,  experience  and  understanding  of  the strategic  challenges  in  the  market  in  which  the  Group operates. The membership of the Board of Directors must be as diverse as possible, with a wide range of technical skills.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  first  considers  how  it  wishes  its membership  to  evolve  in  the  short  and  medium  term, particularly  by  assessing  the  skills  it  wishes  to  bring  to  the Board, and by taking into account the findings of the external assessment  of  its  work  carried  out  every  three  years  by  an external  consultant  responsible  for  mapping  expertise  and identifying possible needs.\n\nAccordingly,  with  the  support  of  Executive  Management  and the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board defines  diversity  objectives  for  its  members  in  terms  of nationality,  independence,  representation  between  men  and women, cultural origin, expertise and seniority, with the aim of achieving a balanced  representation  of  Directors  with complementary backgrounds.\n\nFor this purpose, the Appointments and Governance Committee  has  established  a  procedure  for  selecting  future members of the Board of Directors. The procedure reflects the Board of Directors' focus on its membership and particularly on the diversity of its members, which is considered a source of creativity and performance.\n\nAccordingly, when considering potential profiles for appointment  as  Director,  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee  should  discuss  the  experience,  expertise,  special\n\nskills  and  talents  of  each  candidate  in  relation  to  the objectives  and  characteristics  of  the  diversity  policy  for members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  particularly  in  terms  of nationality, representation between men and women, cultural origin, expertise and seniority.\n\nWhen a seat falls vacant or, more generally, when the Board has  expressed  its  intention  to  appoint  additional  members or change its membership, those elements are reviewed.\n\n## 2.2.3 Executive Management\n\nAfter  the  Combined  General  Meeting  on  May  19,  2005,  when the  shareholders  adopted  the  new  Articles  of  Association  of Kering  SA  (then  PPR),  introducing  governance  by  a  Board  of Directors, the Board of Directors opted to combine the duties of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and maintained this option in  May  2009.  This  choice  has  contributed  to  effective governance  in  light  of  the  organization  of  the  Kering  group, within which Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault is the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  of  Kering  SA,  the  Group's  parent  company. He is related to the controlling shareholder, is heavily involved in conducting  the  Group's  business,  and  has  specific operational  knowledge  and  in-depth  experience  of  this business. At the proposal of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  the  Board  of  Directors  appointed  a  Group  Managing Director ( Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 )  whose term of office was renewed on April 22, 2021. The Group Managing Director has the same powers with regard to dealings with third parties as the Chief Executive Officer. The Group Managing Director was appointed as a Director at the Combined General Meeting on May 7, 2009 for a four-year term, renewed on April 22, 2021 for another four years.",

The  Board  operates  effectively  as  a  result  of  frequent meetings,  the  regular  attendance  of  its  members,  the assistance of its specialized Committees, and the presence of a Lead Independent Director.\n\n## 2.2.4 Limitations set by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  statutory  role  of determining  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Company  and ensuring its implementation, and without prejudice to the legal provisions  governing  the  authorizations  that  must  be  granted by the Board (related-party agreements, endorsements, suretyships  and  guarantees,  divestments  of  shareholdings  or sales of real estate, etc.), the Company's Articles of Association provide  that  certain  decisions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and  Group  Managing  Director,  by  virtue  of  their  nature  or significance, require the prior approval of the Board of Directors:\n\n- a) matters and transactions that have a substantive effect on the Group's strategy, its financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- b) except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual  General Meeting, issues of securities of all types, that are liable to cause a change in the share capital;\n- c) the following transactions effected by the Company or by any  entity  controlled  by  the  Group,  insofar  as  they  each exceed an amount set annually by the Board of Directors (\u20ac500 million in 2022):\n- - all investments or divestments, including the acquisition, sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all  existing  or  future businesses,\n- - all purchases or sales of Company real estate.\n\nThese  transactions  are  regularly  submitted  to  the  Board  of Directors, which examines them carefully.\n\n## 2.2.5 Director independence\n\nIn  order  to  assess  whether  a  Director  can  be  classified  as independent and to avoid possible risks of conflicts of interest, the  Board  applies  the  criteria  defined  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, whereby a Director cannot:\n\n- \u00b7 be  an  employee  or  executive  corporate  officer  of  the Company,  or  have  been  in  such  position  in  the  past  five years;\n- \u00b7 be an employee, executive corporate officer or Director of the Company's parent company or of a company that the latter consolidates, or have been in such a position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company holds a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an  employee  appointed  as  such  or  a  corporate  officer  of the  Company (currently  in  office  or  having  held  office  within the past five years) is a Director;\n- \u00b7 be  a  significant  customer,  supplier,  investment  banker  or commercial  banker  of  the  Company  or  the  Group,  or  for which  the  Company  or  the  Group  represents  a  significant portion of the activity;\n- \u00b7 have any close family ties with a corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 have been the auditor of the Company within the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be  a  Director  of  the  Company  for  more  than  twelve  years, the  maximum  period  for  which  a  Director  is  considered independent.\n\nEach  year,  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee reviews  the  independence  of  each  Director  in  light  of  the criteria  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  In  reviewing independence  with  regard  to  the  direct  or  indirect  business relationship criteria, an additional quantitative and qualitative analysis is performed, if necessary, in order to determine the independence of individual Directors where any such business relationship exists.\n\nIn  2022,  further  to  a  review  by  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  meticulously analyzed  -  along  with  all  other  criteria  -  any  business relationships that may exist between the Kering group and the entities  or  groups  in  which  independent  Directors  exercise their duties. Based on the Board's analysis, with the exception of  Yseulys  Costes,  a  Director  until  April  28,  2022,  Tidjane Thiam,  Serge  Weinberg  and  Yonca  Dervisoglu,  none  of  the independent Directors  and  none  of  the  entities  or  groups  in which  they  hold  executive  responsibilities  have  a  business relationship with the Company, its Group or its management team.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  carried  out  a  qualitative  and quantitative  review  of  the  situation  of  Yseulys  Costes,  Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Numberly - 1000mercis Group, along  with  the  business  relationships  between  Numberly  1000mercis  Group  and  Kering  in  2022.  Global  business between these  two  companies  for  all  activities  and  for  each of the parties was well below the 1% materiality threshold set by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  therefore  considered  Yseulys  Costes to be an independent Director until April 28, 2022, particularly because there is no economic dependence either way.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  analyzed  Tidjane  Thiam's situation when he established Freedom Acquisition Corporation  I,  a  special  purpose  acquisition  company  (SPAC) in which Art\u00e9mis (the Company's controlling shareholder) has invested  alongside  other  investors.  Prior  to  this  investment, Tidjane Thiam consulted the Chairman of the Board to ensure there  was  no  conflict  of  interest.  The  Appointments  and Governance  Committee  regularly  conducts  an  analysis  to confirm  the  independence  situation  and  establish  whether any conflict of interest exists, and the results are shared with the  Lead  Independent  Director.  This  analysis  found  that Tidjane Thiam has this business relationship with Art\u00e9mis (the Company's  controlling  shareholder,  but  not  Kering)  which  is among other investors in the SPAC. Accordingly, the Board of Directors  considers  Tidjane  Thiam  to  be  an  independent Director.\n\nLastly,  the  Board  of  Directors  conducted  a  quantitative  and qualitative review of Serge Weinberg's status. Besides the fact he was a senior executive of the Group more than fifteen years ago  (until  2005),  Serge  Weinberg  accepted  the  Group's investments  in  investment  funds  managed  by  Weinberg Capital,  the  asset  management  company  he  founded  and  in which  he  serves  as  chairman  of  the  board  of  directors. An  analysis  was  carried  out  by  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee  to  confirm  his  independence  and establish whether there is any conflict of interest. The analysis showed  that  the  investments  remain  well  below  the  1% materiality threshold adopted by the Board of Directors, and, secondly,  they  do  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  a  business relationship as stated in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors considers Serge Weinberg to be an independent Director.\n\nLastly,  the  Board  of  Directors  conducted  a  quantitative  and qualitative  review  regarding  the  status  of  Yonca  Dervisoglu, Vice-President, Marketing at Google for the EMEA region, and of business relations between Google and Kering in 2022.\n\nGlobal business between these two companies for all activities and for each of the parties was well below the 1% materiality threshold  set  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  is  not  likely  to influence  the  way  Ms.  Dervisoglu  votes  at  the  Board's meetings. Furthermore, Ms. Dervisoglu does not herself have any  business  connections  and  is  not  a  member  of  any governance body capable of giving rise to a conflict of interest.\n\nFor  these  reasons,  the  Board  of  Directors  considers  Yonca Dervisoglu to be an independent Director.\n\nAccordingly, six of the eleven (1) Directors (serving on the Board as of March 2, 2023) were therefore classified as independent (Yonca Dervisoglu, Daniela Riccardi, Emma Watson, V\u00e9ronique Weill,  Tidjane  Thiam  and  Serge  Weinberg).  The  Group  thus satisfies  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code, namely that 'at least one third' of Board members should be independent Directors in companies with controlling shareholders, which is the case for Kering.\n\n## 2.2.6 Succession plan\n\nIn collaboration  with  the  Company's  management,  the Appointments and Governance Committee periodically reviews  the  succession  plan  at  two  levels.  The  first  of  these covers  executive  corporate  officers,  i.e.,  the  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director, and the  second  covers  the  current  or  prospective  Executive Committee  members,  Houses  CEOs  and  their  designers/ Creative  Directors.    This  allows  it  to  establish  and  update succession plans that cover different time frames:\n\n- \u00b7 short  term:  unplanned  succession  (resignation,  death, sudden inability to perform the role);\n- \u00b7 medium term: accelerated succession (performance problem, management error);\n- \u00b7 long term: planned succession (retirement, end of term of office).\n\nThe process of drawing up a succession plan for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director, was scrutinized thoroughly by the Appointments and Governance Committee at its meeting on February 4, 2022 and at a special meeting  on  November  21,  2022.  The  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director were also involved  in  the  Committee's  work  on  this  assignment.  The method  selected  takes  into  account  the  Group's  specific characteristics,  particularly  in  terms  of  governance.  Various phases have been defined. The first involves determining the potential changes in governance that would be required in the event  of  a  change  at  the  Company's  helm,  based  on  an extensive study of organizational practices in the industry and among Kering's CAC 40 peers. The Committee also identified\n\nthe most appropriate characteristics to implement the strategic plan drawn up by the Board and the principles that govern the relationship  between  the  Corporate  and  the  Group's  House teams.  This  lays  the  groundwork  for  the  final  phase,  which consists in drawing up a list of potential candidates.\n\nCollaboration  between  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee and the Company's management team ensures the overall  coherence  of  the  succession  plan  and  monitoring  of key  positions.  The  effectiveness  of  the  approach  has  been demonstrated,  when  the  arrival  of  executives  or  Creative Directors  of  certain  of  the  Group's  Houses  has  led  to  a rebound or an acceleration in organic growth for the Houses concerned.\n\nThe  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  continues  to apply the same method to prepare a succession plan for the Executive  Committee  and  for  a  certain  number  of  key positions within the Group.\n\n## 2.2.7 Director induction and training\n\nUpon joining  the  Board  and  throughout  their  term  of  office, Directors may receive training tailored to their specific needs within the Board, should they deem it necessary. Meetings are organized  with  the  Lead  Independent  Director,  the  Group Managing  Director  and  with  the  Group's  executives  to  give them an insight into the Group and into each of its businesses.\n\nFollowing  the  appointment  of  three  new  members  at  the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022, these new Directors followed an onboarding program that introduced them to and gave  them  an  understanding  of  the  Group  and  its  business activities. They also learned about its strategic challenges and priorities,  the  culture  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  and  its governance framework. More specifically, they were given:\n\n- \u00b7 an information pack containing the requisite documents to understand  the  Group's  business  activities,  the  Board's internal  rules,  the  stock  market  code  of  conduct  and conflicts  of  interest  prevention  rules,  the  Articles  of Association,  the  minutes  of  meetings  over  the  past  five years  of  the  Board  and  of  the  specialized  Committees  of which they are members; and\n- \u00b7 individual  conversations  with  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer, the Group Managing Director, the Houses CEOs,  the  Group's  Chief  Financial  Officer,  the  Chief Sustainability  Officer,  the  Chief  Communications  Officer, the Chief People Officer, the Internal Audit Director and the Group General Counsel.\n\nTraining specially designed for Directors representing employees  is  also  arranged.  These  internal  and  external training  sessions  are  arranged  and  paid  for  solely  by  the Company.\n\nLastly,  special  training  on  CSR  and  climate  issues  facing  the Group  is  planned  during  2023.  Various  internal  and  external experts have been lined up to speak to the Directors.\n\nIn addition, the Board's work is assessed regularly, as described in section 2.3.2 of this chapter.",

The  relevant  Committee  Chair  reports  on these preliminary meetings at each Board meeting.\n\nIn  addition,  at  the  Lead  Independent  Director's  initiative, members of the Board met on December 8, 2022 to consider the  agenda  set  forth  in  the  above  table,  without  the Company's  executive  corporate  officers  (the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director). The Lead Independent Director also met individually with the Directors during the year.\n\nTo maintain ongoing dialogue with its investors, the Company continued  to  organize  meetings  with  its  shareholders  and other members of the financial community in 2022.\n\nAt  the  initiative  of  its  Board  of  Directors,  the  Company  has forged  a  stronger  dialogue  with  investors  since  2018, particularly  on  governance  issues.  Given  the  approach  was unanimously  applauded  by  the  investors  involved,  it  was continued in subsequent years, broadening the scope to include environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. A roadshow program dedicated to the ESG issues was prepared by the Lead\n\nIndependent Director (whose role is described in detail in section 1.5 of this chapter). She was supported in this task by the Board secretary,  the  Chief  Sustainability  Officer,  the  Investor  Relations Department,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  the  Chief  People Officer.\n\n## Activity of the Board of Directors in 2023 up to March 2\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, the Board of Directors has met three times on February 1, February 14 and March 2, 2023, to, among  other  things,  approve  the  2022  annual  financial statements and reports to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting,  including  this  report  on  corporate  governance,  and to convene the Meeting. It also heard a report on the Group's financial  position.  The  Board  then  granted  and  allocated  the Directors'  remuneration  for  2022  in  accordance  with  the criteria adopted by the Board.\n\nIn  addition,  at  its  meeting  on  March  2,  2023,  the  Board  of Directors  took  action  following  the  controversy  over  a Balenciaga's advertising campaign.\n\n## 2.3.2 Assessment of the Board of Directors' operating rules\n\nSince 2004, in accordance with its internal rules, the Board of Directors  has  dedicated  one  item  on  its  agenda,  at  least  once a  year,  to  a  discussion  of  its  operating  rules  every  three  years, this  discussion  is  backed  up  by  a  formal  assessment  of  the Board's  operating  rules  by  an  independent  member  or  a third-party expert.\n\nThe  previous  assessment  was  carried  out  in  2021  by  a third-party  expert,  management  consulting  and  recruitment firm Egon  Zehnder,  with  respected  experience  in  the governance  of  boards  of  directors  of  listed  companies. The  assessment  consisted  of  a  questionnaire  and  individual meetings  with  each  Director.  In  addition  to  an  assessment  of the  individual  contribution  made  by  each  Director,  the assessment also covered the following points:\n\n- \u00b7 the membership and role of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 induction arrangements for new Directors;\n- \u00b7 the contribution by the Board to the Group's strategy;\n- \u00b7 the role of the Board on ESG issues.",

At  the  initiative  of  the  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors is very mindful of  ESG  issues  and  has  incorporated  them  in  its  enterprise performance  metrics.  The  quality  of  the  work  performed  by the four Committees was also unanimously applauded.\n\nThe strategic sessions and presentations were greatly appreciated, backing  up  the  decision  to  involve  the  entire  Board  in  these issues.

The  assessment revealed a positive view of the operating rules of the Board of Directors and its Committees. The composition of the Board is regarded  as  having  improved,  especially  after  the  three  new independent Directors joined in 2022. The size of the Board, its gender balance, and the age and length of service profile of its  members  were  also  deemed  to  be  appropriate.  The Directors  all  emphasized  the  high  quality  of  discussions  and the relevance of the issues addressed, as well as the climate of trust  and  openness  that  exists  between  Board  members, fostering a full and frank exchange of views on all matters. The quality  of  the  work  performed  by  the  Committees  and  their contribution  to  the  Board's  decision-making  were  also highlighted. Directors are appreciative the degree of transparency between the Board and Executive Management, which fosters real trust, and of the leadership provided by the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Several  areas  were identified  in  which  the  Board's  operating  rules  could  be improved:  (i)  a  stronger  composition  in  terms  of  sectoral expertise  and  representation  of  the  Group's  key  markets;  (ii) greater focus on certain strategic issues and more time to be spent on examining the Committees' reports; (iii) improvement  of  attendance  rate  at  Board  of  Directors  and Committees'  meetings;  (iv)  greater  interaction  between  the Board and the operational executives and more site visits.\n\nThe  Board  will  draw  up  specific  measures  to  address  these various points during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Committee  can  also  retain external specialists and hear from any other individuals.\n\nEach  year,  it  reviews  the  fees  charged  by  the  Company's Statutory Auditors and assesses their independence. The Audit Committee  also  considers  potential  Statutory  Auditors  for appointment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Committee  issues  recommendations  to  the Board of Directors in relation to the regular assessment of the terms  of  the  Group's  related-party  and  ordinary  agreements. In this context,  it reviews  payments  made  under  the agreement entered into between  Kering and Art\u00e9mis (described  in  Note  29.1  to  the  consolidated  financial statements,  included  in  this  document),  as  well  as  any changes in such payments, on an annual basis.\n\nThe Audit Committee members all have recognized financial or accounting skills,  bringing  to  bear  their  combined  expertise  in general and operational management of banks and businesses as evidenced by their professional career (see section 2.1 of this chapter).  Tidjane  Thiam,  Chair  of  the  Audit  Committee  and notably  Executive  Chairman  of  SPAC  Freedom  Acquisition Corporation I and former Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, brings to this Committee his renowned expertise and financial skills.  Jean-Pierre  Denis  was  previously  Chairman  of  Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel  Ark\u00e9a  and  a  Finance  Inspector,  and  has  gained considerable  executive  management  experience.  V\u00e9ronique Weill has held various responsibilities in financial services, with investment  banking  her  key  focus.  H\u00e9lo\u00efse  Temple-Boyer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Art\u00e9mis, and Serge Weinberg, Chairman  of  an  asset  management  company,  also  possess\n\nrespected  executive  management  experience.  Given  their professional  experience  (described  in  section  2.1  of  this chapter: 'List of terms of office and positions held by members of the Board of Directors') and their first-class knowledge of the accounting  and  financial  procedures  applicable  to  groups  of companies,  all  the  Audit  Committee  members  have  the requisite skills for their roles.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  two  thirds  of  the members  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  independent  Directors, and no member is an executive corporate officer.\n\n## Tender process for the reappointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nFor the record, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was appointed as  a  Statutory  Auditor  of  the  Group  at  the  Annual  General Meeting held on April 28, 2022.\n\nA  tender  procedure  was  held  ahead  of  this  appointment.  It consisted of the review of the bids submitted by an internal selection committee (consisting of the Internal Audit Director, General Counsel, the Financial Control Director and the Chief Financial  Officer),  follow-up  on  interviews  with  the  various bidders, and the Audit Committee's review and approval.\n\nThe  same  transparent  and  fair  tender  methodology  will  be used  when  the  Statutory  Auditors  next  come  up  for reappointment.\n\n## Work performed by the Audit Committee in 2022\n\nThe  Committee  met  five  times  in  2022,  with  an  average attendance rate of 86%.\n\nDuring  2022,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Group  Internal Audit Director were regularly invited to present their work and answer questions at meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed the following:\n\n| The process  of preparing  accounting  and financial  information   | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7   | Review of the annual and interim parent company and consolidated financial statements, off-balance sheet commitments, and the activity report Review of the services performed by Art\u00e9mis in 2021 Update on the Group's financing and cash management Review of the Company's share price performance   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Internal audit                                                      | \u00b7         | Review of the internal audit activities (audit engagements and follow-up on action plans) during 2022 and early 2023                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Internal control  and risk                                          | \u00b7         | Review of the internal control activities Review of the risk management system including the approach to preparing the Group's risk map and                                                                                                                                                             |\n| management                                                          | \u00b7 \u00b7       | presentation of the risk hierarchy (including CSR priorities) Review of the Group's cybersecurity (mapping of cyber risks, action plans and related training)                                                                                                                                           |\n| Statutory  Auditors                                                 | \u00b7 \u00b7       | Review of the scope of the Statutory Auditors' engagement, the independence of the Statutory Auditors, and their general program for audit work Presentation by the Statutory Auditors of their work on the annual and interim financial statements                                                     |\n| Other                                                               | \u00b7         | Review of disputes Review of the Group's intellectual property policy - examination of the protection of the brand portfolio                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                                                     | \u00b7 \u00b7       | Review of data protection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nThe Audit Committee reported to the Board of Directors on its work and issued its recommendations.",

In this capacity, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault is invited to attend the meetings of the Board of Directors on a consultative basis.\n\nHe did not attend any of these meetings in 2022.\n\n## 2.5 Compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations\n\nOn October 22, 2008, the Board of Directors announced that it had examined and adopted the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations  of  October  6,  2008  on  the  remuneration of  corporate  officers  of  listed  companies  as  a  reference corporate  governance  framework,  and  had  deemed  that  the aforementioned  recommendations  were  all  line  with  the corporate  governance  approach  already  implemented  by  the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations resulting from the consolidation of the October 2003  AFEP  and  MEDEF  reports,  the aforementioned January 2007 and October 2008 AFEP-MEDEF recommendations and the April 2010 AFEP-MEDEF recommendation to strengthen the representation of women within  boards,  as  revised  in  June  2013,  November  2015, November 2016 and June 2018 and amended in January 2020 (the  'AFEP-MEDEF  Code')  and  its  January  2020  application guide. These  principles were  notably  applied  for  the preparation  of  this  report  on  corporate  governance.  The AFEP-MEDEF Code is available in English on the AFEP website at www.afep.com and the MEDEF website at www.medef.com.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L.  22-10-10,  paragraph  4  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  Kering  refers  to  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, and complies with all its recommendations.\n\n## Attendance at Annual General Meetings\n\nAll shareholders  are  entitled  to  attend  Annual  General Meetings  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  provided  for  by law.

The  policy  takes  account  of the  recommendations  set  out  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate Governance  Code  of  Listed  Corporations  as  revised  in  June 2018,  updated  in  January  2020,  and  the  December  2022 recommendations on the board's role as a guardian of the CSR strategy.  It  also  reflects  the  guide  to  developing  universal\n\nregistration documents  published  by  the  French  financial markets  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers -  AMF)  on January  5,  2022  and  the  reports  on  corporate  governance and  executive  remuneration  in  listed  companies  issued  by the  AMF  and  the  High  Committee  on  Corporate  Governance ( Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise ). The remuneration policy  for  all  corporate  officers  is  an  integral  part  of  Kering's report on corporate governance.\n\n## 4.1 Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director (executive corporate officers) for 2023, subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of April 27, 2023 ( ex-ante vote)\n\nActing on a recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the  Board  of  Directors  approved  on  March  2,  2023  the remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director for 2023.\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  Articles  L.  22-10-8  and R. 22-10-14  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  2023 remuneration  policy  described  below  includes  the  general principles and  criteria for determining, allocating and awarding  the  fixed,  variable  and  exceptional  components making up total remuneration and benefits in kind granted to executive corporate officers in respect of their duties. It will be submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  at  Kering's Annual General Meeting to be held on April 27, 2023.\n\n## 4.1.1 General principles of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director\n\nThe  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  executive  corporate officers is set by the Board  of  Directors, based  on recommendations  from  the  Remuneration  Committee,  in compliance with the Company's interests to ensure the longterm success and development of the business and embeds social and environmental issues arising from its activities. The remuneration structure and the criteria on which it is based are  defined  and  modified  over  time  to  ensure  that  the amounts paid are closely aligned with the extent to which the Group's  strategic  financial  and  non-financial  objectives  have been  met.  The  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  executive corporate  officers  is  approved  each  year  by  shareholders  at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nA large proportion of the remuneration of executive corporate officers  are  subject  to  performance  conditions  (84%  for  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 80% for the Group Managing  Director),  reflecting  their  obligation  to  create medium- and long-term value.\n\nThe variable portion of executive corporate officers' remuneration  is  subject  to  performance  conditions  relating to financial criteria as well as corporate, social and environmental responsibility, reflecting the Group's ambitious objectives  in  these  areas,  and  encouraging  the  executive corporate  officers  to  base  their  decisions  and  actions  on ensuring long-term profitability.\n\nThe  decision  approved  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of June  16,  2020  to  replace  Kering  Monetary  Units  (KMUs)  with performance  shares  in  the  long-term  incentive  component of  executive  corporate  officers'  remuneration  illustrates  the Group's  desire  to  make  the  alignment  between  executive remuneration and shareholder interests even clearer.\n\nThe  performance  criteria  for  the  executive  corporate  officers' annual and multi-annual variable remuneration are clear, specific and  varied.  They  include  both  financial  criteria  -  recurring operating  income  and  free  cash  flow  from  operations  -  and non-financial  criteria,  relating  in  particular  to  sustainability, compliance, and organization and talent management.\n\nThe level of achievement of the financial targets is determined by the Group's Finance Department. The level of achievement of the non-financial targets is first assessed by the Remuneration  Committee,  which  reports  thereupon  to  the Board of Directors.  This  assessment  is  based  on  information provided  by  the  Legal,  Sustainability  and  Human  Resources Departments,  members  of  which  may  be  present  during  the meeting to provide commentary.\n\nDecisions  about  the  composition  of  the  executive  corporate officers'  remuneration  and  its  modification  over  time  whether in relation to the balance between fixed and variable components or the choice of performance criteria - are based on  proposals  made  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  These proposals are predicated, in turn, on analyses and recommendations  provided  by  the  Group's  Sustainability, Human Resources, Remuneration and Employee Benefits, and Legal Departments.\n\nA review of the existing system is carried out annually to assess whether  changes  should  be  made,  based  on  continuous monitoring  of  market  practice  and  in  line  with  any  legislative developments.  Where  appropriate,  it  may  be  supported  by  an assignment  conducted  by  external  consultants.  When  market practices  are  benchmarked  (both  in  terms  of  remuneration levels  and  the  principles  for  determining  and  managing remuneration), comparisons are made with reference companies selected from the French and international markets on the basis of their size and sector of activity.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  and  the payment of the variable  components due to them based on the  principles  applied  are  discussed  and  decided  on  by  the Board  of  Directors,  based  on  recommendations  from  the Remuneration  Committee  and  following  the  approval  of  the financial statements for the previous fiscal year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The proposed amount of fixed remuneration is in line with executive pay practices implemented by the Group's CAC 40 and (international) luxury market peers.\n\nFixed remuneration serves as the basis for calculating annual variable remuneration and determining the value of long-term remuneration.  In  line  with  recommendation  26.3.1  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it is not reviewed systematically each year.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore proposes leaving the annual fixed  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director at \u20ac1,200,000 each, a level it had been at for the last six years (1) .\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nVariable  remuneration  is  designed  to  align  the  reward accruing  to  executive  corporate  officers  with  the  Group's annual  financial  performance  and  its  strategic  long-term environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  objectives.  It  is stated as a percentage of annual fixed remuneration.\n\nFollowing  approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  at  the  Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022, annual variable remuneration is,  when targets are met, equal to 150% of fixed remuneration for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director (versus 120% of fixed remuneration for the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  100%  of  fixed remuneration  for  the  Group  Managing  Director).  With  fixed remuneration  remaining  stable  over  time,  this  shift  in  the relative weighting of annual variable remuneration is intended, in line with international practice, to link the overall remuneration awarded to the executive corporate officers even more closely with the Group's performance.\n\nWhen targets are exceeded, annual variable remuneration may amount to 203% of fixed remuneration for the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director, provided that the achievement of the financial targets reaches or  exceeds  125%  of  the  thresholds  set  and  that  all  nonfinancial targets are met.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  long-term  strategy  on  ESG  issues, achievement  of  equally-weighted  non-financial  performance criteria affects 30%  of annual variable remuneration. The  criteria  are  based  on  three  key  areas:  organization  and talent management, compliance, and sustainability.\n\nAs a result, the annual variable remuneration of the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of  the  Group  Managing Director is determined as follows:\n\n## Distribution of the annual variable remuneration criteria\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) In  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  impact  on  business  activity,  and  following  the  decision  made  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer,  at  its  meeting  of  April  21,  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  as  an  exceptional  measure,  to  reduce  the  amount  of  the  fixed remuneration proposed for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2020 to an amount of \u20ac960,000.",

For confidentiality reasons, the targets associated with financial criteria are not disclosed at the time they are set but disclosed ex-post for assessing  the achievement rate of these targets.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee, non-financial  targets  are  assessed  each  year  by  the  Board, which  takes  into  account  the  performance  of  the  Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of  the  Group  Managing Director based on reports and presentations that describe the level of achievement  of  each  target  and  justify  the corresponding remuneration  awarded  to  the  executive corporate officers.\n\nThis assessment is based on a detailed proposal prepared by the  Remuneration  Committee,  which  relies  in  particular  on objective  information  reported  by  the  Chief  People  Officer, the  Head of  Remuneration and Employee Benefits, the Chief Sustainability  Officer  and  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  in relation  to  the  strategic  goals  defined  at  the  beginning  of the year.\n\nThe  above-described  principles  for  the  determination  of annual  variable  remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate officers will be pursued in 2023 subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nTotal variable remuneration due for 2023 will be paid in 2024, following  the  Annual  General  Meeting's  approval  of  the financial  statements.  Payment  is  also  subject  to  the  Annual General Meeting's approval of the 2023 remuneration policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the achievement rate reaches or exceeds 125%, 150% of the target amount is paid out.\n\n|                                                                                                    | Percentage of bonus awarded   | As a % of fixed remuneration Chairman-CEO and GMD (150% of fixed remuneration)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Achievement rate of financial targets (70% of the bonus) (1)                                       |                               |                                                                                  |\n| \u2264 75%                                                                                              | 0%                            | 0%                                                                               |\n| 100%                                                                                               | 100%                          | 105%                                                                             |\n| \u2265 125%                                                                                             | 150%                          | 158%                                                                             |\n| Achievement rate of non-financial targets (30% of the bonus)                                       |                               |                                                                                  |\n| Criterion 1                                                                                        | 0% to 100%                    | 0% to 15%                                                                        |\n| Criterion 2                                                                                        | 0% to 100%                    | 0% to 15%                                                                        |\n| Criterion 3                                                                                        | 0% to 100%                    | 0% to 15%                                                                        |\n| Maximum bonus (for achieving 125% of the financial targets and 100%  of the non-financial targets) |                               | 203%                                                                             |\n\n- (1) See graph below illustrating the rate of payment of the bonus depending on the achievement of financial targets.\n\n## Share of the bonus relating to financial targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPERCENTAGE ACHIEVED\n\nAny  achievement  falling  between  the  minimum  (75%)  and  the  target  (100%)  achievement  rates  or  between  the  target  and the maximum (125%) achievement rates will give rise to annual variable remuneration calculated on a straight-line basis between the relevant thresholds.

        "page_content": "## Multi-annual variable remuneration\n\n## Long-term remuneration\n\nSince  2020,  the  executive  corporate  officers'  long-term remuneration has been based on free grants of performance shares, which have replaced the Kering Monetary Units (KMUs).\n\nThis system  serves  to  tighten  the  link between  the remuneration of executive corporate officers and their direct contribution  to  the  long-term  performance  of  the  company, while  also  aligning  its  interests  with  the  interests  of shareholders.\n\nThe  performance  share  award  plan  for  executive  corporate officers  is  accompanied  by  a  share  award  plan  for  other employees in key positions within the Group. In addition, the annual  award  of  performance  shares  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  is capped by the Board of Directors  at  20%  of  the  total  shares granted by the Board of Directors during each fiscal year.\n\nFollowing approval of the remuneration policy at the Annual General  Meeting  of  April  28,  2022,  the  target  multi-annual variable remuneration is for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and for the Group Managing Director respectively 150% and  100%  of  the  sum  of  fixed  remuneration  and  annual variable remuneration due in respect of 2022 (versus 100% of fixed  remuneration  for  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  and  80% for the Group Managing Director previously).\n\nWith fixed remuneration remaining stable over time, this shift in the relative weighting of multi-annual variable remuneration is also intended, in line with international practices, to link the overall  remuneration  awarded  to  the  executive  corporate officers even more closely with the Group's performance.\n\nThe  duration  of  vesting  period  of  the  shares  is  three  years, in  line  with  the  measurement  period  of  the  performance conditions and customary market practice.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe  combination  of  performance  conditions  governing  the multi-annual  variable  remuneration  of  both  the  executive corporate officers presented below aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 make  the  number  of  shares  actually  obtained  following the  three-year  vesting  period  conditional,  not  only  on  the achievement  of  financial  targets,  but  also  on  a  broader performance metric reflecting the Group's strategic commitment to ESG issues;\n- \u00b7 increase the assessment of the percentage achievement of the financial criteria;\n- \u00b7 maintain  the  emphasis  on  the  performance  of  the  Kering share relative to that of a reference index of luxury goods companies.\n\nThese  criteria,  which  applied  in  the  previous  year,  will  again  be implemented for 2023.\n\nAccordingly, the number of performance shares awarded to executive corporate officers that ultimately vest is initially subject to the criteria and weightings indicated in the table below:\n\n| Criteria                                              | Relative  weighting   | Performance

of the financial and non-financial performance conditions described above and the service condition described below is then adjusted upward or downward by a maximum proportion  of  50%,  depending  on  the  performance  of  the Kering share price (difference in price between the award date\n\nof the performance shares and the end of the vesting period) relative to the performance of a reference index over the same period. The reference index comprises the shares of the following eight  listed  companies:  Burberry,  Ferragamo,  Herm\u00e8s,  LVMH, Moncler, Prada, Richemont and Swatch.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  is  also  in  line  with  the  Company's  strategy  of  aligning Directors' remuneration with the corporate interest.\n\nThe variable remuneration allocated to the Directors is notably based on their actual presence at meetings of the Board and its  specialized  Committees  and  on  the  time  and  efforts required  of  them  to  prepare  for  and  participate  in  these meetings. The Lead Independent Director receives additional remuneration,  which  is  subject  to  the  achievement  of predefined  objectives  relating  to  his  duties.  The  Lead Independent Director's duties are described in section 1.5.2 of this  chapter. The Climate Change Lead also receives a higher level of remuneration for performing his duties, as presented in section 1.6 of this chapter.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Committee  prepares  and  monitors  the remuneration  policy  for  Directors.  The  total  amount  of remuneration  allocated  to  the  Directors  and  the  allocation criteria  are  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nThe Board and Remuneration Committee meetings that deal with  the  remuneration  policy  are  carried  out  in  strict compliance with the procedures for preventing and managing conflicts  of  interest,  which  are  described  in  the  Board's internal rules, and Directors do not participate in discussions or votes on resolutions that relate to their own remuneration.\n\nCorporate Board member (and controlling company) Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has  waived  all  remuneration  in  respect  of its  duties  as  a  Director  within  the  Group  (including  as  a Director of Kering SA) or as a member of the specialized Board Committees.\n\nConcetta Battaglia and Vincent Schaal, the Directors representing employees, both have a permanent employment contract with the Company or a Group company.\n\n## 4.2.2 Components of the remuneration policy for members of the Board of Directors\n\nActing on the recommendation of the Board of Directors and following  shareholders'  approval  at  the  Annual  General Meeting on April 22, 2021, the total remuneration allocated to the  Directors  was  lifted  from  \u20ac877,000,  its  level  since  2017, to \u20ac1,400,000. The higher figure reflects the increased number of  Board  members,  the  additional  remuneration  allocated to  the  Lead  Independent  Director,  and  the  special  portion allocated  to  the  Sustainability  Committee  Chair  in  order  to align this Committee Chairmanship with the others.\n\nDirectors' remuneration is allocated on the basis of the actual presence  of  members  at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  its specialized Committees.\n\nThe  breakdown  between  fixed  and  variable  remuneration remains unchanged, at 40% fixed and 60% variable.\n\nDirectors'  remuneration  is  thus  allocated  in  the  following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus (i) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Appointments and Governance, and Sustainability Committees,  respectively  (\u20ac23,000  each),  (ii)  a  special portion allocated to the Lead Independent Director for her role  on  the  Board  (\u20ac50,000  for  2023),  and  (iii)  a  special portion  allocated  to  the  Climate  Change  Lead  (\u20ac23,000), with  the  remainder  being  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of 1 per Board membership, increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 a  variable  portion,  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  per presence  at  each  meeting  of  the  Board  and  0.5  for  each attendance of a Committee meeting.\n\nThe remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director will be subject to the achievement of objectives set in advance by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Lead  Independent  Director's  objectives  for  2023  will  be the following:\n\n- \u00b7 promote  and  maintain  a  good  relationship  between  the Board and its shareholders and investors;\n- \u00b7 coordinate the assessment of the Board and its members;\n- \u00b7 facilitate and  build relationships within the Board, including by holding meetings without executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  mechanisms  to prevent and resolve potential conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 report, on a quarterly basis, to the Chairman of the Board on the performance of her duties.\n\n## Draft resolution regarding the remuneration policy for Directors\n\n## Eighth resolution: Approval of the remuneration policy for Directors\n\nDeliberating  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  quorum  and majority  applicable  to  ordinary  general  meetings  and  having reviewed  the  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate governance, the Annual General Meeting approves, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, the remuneration policy for Directors as described in the aforementioned  report,  which  is  included  in  the  2022 Universal  Registration  Document,  Chapter  3  'Report  on corporate  governance',  section  4.2  'Remuneration  policy applicable to the members of the Board of Directors for 2023, subject  to  approval  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of April 27, 2023 ( ex-ante vote).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Past awards of Kering Monetary Units (KMU)\n\nThe previous long-term remuneration system (which applied from  2013  to  2019)  was  based  on  Kering  Monetary  Units (KMUs),  which  have  now  been  replaced  with  free  grants  of performance shares.\n\nThe value of these KMUs was indexed equally to both absolute changes in the Kering share price and to changes in the Kering share  price  relative  to  a  panel  of  seven  luxury  stocks (Burberry,  Ferragamo,  LVMH,  Prada,  Richemont,  Swatch  and Tod's).\n\nThese  KMUs  have  a  vesting  period  of  three  years  as  from January  1  of  the  year  in  which  they  are  granted,  after  which they  may  be  cashed  in  by  the  beneficiaries  over  a  two-year period  (during  two  windows  each  year).  At  that  point,  the beneficiaries  may  receive  the  cash  equivalent  of  their  KMUs based  on  the  last  assessed  value.  A  table  summarizing  the KMUs  granted  to  each  executive  corporate  officer  -  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing\n\nDirector -that  have  become  available  or  are  still  vesting,  is shown below.\n\nTo align the multi-annual variable remuneration system with the  Group's  long-term  performance,  vesting  of  the  KMUs awarded to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group  Managing  Director  was  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of performance  criteria  based  on  three  financial  indicators assessed at Group level:\n\n- \u00b7 recurring operating income;\n- \u00b7 free cash flow from operations;\n- \u00b7 recurring operating margin.\n\nUnder  this  system  put  in  place  in  2017,  if  an  increase  was observed in at least one of these three indicators between the average  amount  over  the  three-year  vesting  period  and  the amount shown in Kering's  consolidated  financial  statements for the year preceding the year of the grant, 100% of the KMUs granted  were  cashed  in  (the  change  in  each  indicator  is measured  at  constant  scope  and  as  reported).  Failing  this, the KMUs were definitively forfeited.\n\nStarting  in  2019,  in  line  with  the  remuneration  policy approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of April 24, 2019, the following system applied:\n\n- \u00b7 three criteria met: 100% of the KMUs vest,\n- \u00b7 two of three criteria met: 75% of the KMUs vest,\n- \u00b7 one of three criteria met: 50% of the KMUs vest;\n- \u00b7 no criteria met: no KMUs may be cashed in.\n\nThe  financial  criteria  were  based  on  the  indicators  used  to assess  the  Group's  performance.  The  mechanism  in  place meets stricter requirements, since the KMU value is not per se a  performance condition but influences the amount actually paid at the exercise date.\n\nNote  that  the  KMUs  awarded  in  2019  to  the  executive corporate officers represented the final award of KMUs before they were replaced by free performance share grants starting in 2020.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code  and  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors  decided  on  March  10,  2017  to  remove  the  lock-in obligation  on  Kering  shares  obtained  by  cashing  in  KMUs, because  these  instruments  provide  exclusively  for  a  cash settlement.\n\n## Method applied to value KMUs\n\nChanges in the KMU value are assessed on a six-monthly basis (as  of  June  30  and  December  31  each  year),  based  on  the Kering share price during the last 30 trading days. This value is then  weighted  for  the  performance  of  the  Kering  share relative to the basket of benchmark stocks.\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  six-month  period,  the  value  of  a  KMU  is calculated as follows:\n\nUVs+1 = UVs x ([1+VKs+1] + ([1+VKs+1] x [1+VKs+1] / [1+VPVs+1])) / 2\n\n## Where:\n\nUV = Unit of Value.\n\ns+1 = the six-monthly closing date at which the unit of value is assessed (06/30 or 12/31).\n\ns = the previous six-monthly closing.\n\nVK = the change in the Kering share price over the six-month period,  using  the  average  share  price  over  the  30  days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nVPV = the change in the price of a panel of stocks over the sixmonth period, equal to the arithmetic average change in these stocks,  using  the  average  share  price  over  the  30  days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nThe following companies  were  used  to  compile  the benchmark:  Burberry,  Ferragamo,  LVMH,  Prada,  Richemont, Swatch and Tod's.\n\n<!-- image -->",

have formally undertaken not to  use  hedges  on  their  performance  shares  and  no  such hedges are currently in place.\n\n## Pay ratios between the level of remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director and the average and median remuneration of Company employees\n\nIn accordance  with  Article  L.  22-10-9  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  the  following  table  presents  the  ratios between the level of remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Group  Managing  Director  and  the average and median remuneration of Company employees on a full-time equivalent basis over the past five years.\n\nThese  ratios  were  established  in  line  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF guidelines on remuneration multiples published on January 28, 2020 and updated in February 2021.\n\nFor  the  executive  corporate  officers,  the  components  of remuneration taken into account are:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration in Y;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in year Y for year Y-1;\n- \u00b7 the value of the long-term remuneration granted during the year;\n- \u00b7 remuneration  paid  in  respect  of  duties  as  a  Director (formerly known as Directors' fees) paid in Y;\n\n- \u00b7 exceptional remuneration (where applicable) granted in Y;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nFor  the  employees  (on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis),  the components of remuneration taken into account are:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration in Y;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in year Y for year Y-1;\n- \u00b7 individual bonuses paid in Y;\n- \u00b7 profit-sharing and incentives paid in year Y;\n- \u00b7 the  value  of  performance  shares  granted  during  the  year at their IFRS value;\n- \u00b7 the value of any other long-term incentives awarded;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nThe  ratios  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  remuneration  paid and awarded during the year.\n\nTo make them more representative, these fairness ratios have been calculated for two different scopes of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering SA, the listed company, with around 703 employees;\n- \u00b7 a  broader  scope  of  analysis  consisting  of  the  Kering  SA employees  and  the  French  employees  of  Saint  Laurent, Balenciaga  and  Gucci,  or  3,452  employees,  representing 77% of the Group's employees based in France.\n\nData  for  the  larger  scope  of  analysis  are  available  only  from 2019,  when  the  joint  payroll  system  that  can  provide  such consolidated figures was introduced.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  and  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Palus  held  the positions  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of Group  Managing  Director,  respectively,  during  the  five-year period in question.",

They are not entitled to any conditional or deferred remuneration.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  March  2,  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors decided,  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee,  to  allocate  remuneration  to  Directors  in  respect of their duties on the basis of the actual presence of members at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  its  specialized  Committees during 2022.\n\nFollowing  shareholders'  approval  at  the  Annual  General Meeting on April 22, 2021, the total remuneration allocated to the Directors was lifted from \u20ac877,000, unchanged since 2017, to  \u20ac1,400,000.  The  increase  reflects  the  larger  number  of Board members, the additional remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director, and the special portion allocated to the Sustainability Committee Chair.\n\nOut of the total amount set at the Annual General Meeting, the rule  followed  by  the  Board  in  order  to  comply  with  the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendation for a significant variable component  with  respect  to  remuneration  awarded  to Directors is to divide the total amount into a 40% fixed portion and  a  60%  variable  portion.  The  remuneration  is  thus allocated  in  the  following  manner  (Financi\u00e8re  Pinault  has waived all remuneration in respect of its duties as a Director):\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus (i) a special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Appointments and Governance, and Sustainability Committees,  respectively  (\u20ac23,000  each),  (ii)  a  special portion corresponding to the remuneration of the Committee Vice-Chair (\u20ac11,500), and (iii) a special portion allocated to the Lead Independent Director for her role on the Board (\u20ac50,000 for 2022), the balance being allocated with  a  coefficient  of  1  per  Board  membership,  increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 a  variable  portion,  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  per presence  at  each  meeting  of  the  Board  and  0.5  for  each attendance of a Committee meeting.",

Since 2013, this approach has allowed Kering to identify the key challenges relating to its vision and its activities (based on their  economic,  environmental  and  social  impacts),  and  also to  grasp  the  related  governance  issues  and  the  assessment made by the Group's key stakeholders.\n\n## 1.3.1.1 Materiality assessment methodology and stakeholder engagement process\n\nKering consulted its stakeholders around the world in 2020 in order  to  update  its  materiality  assessment.  This  three-step materiality assessment drew on various existing guidelines for stakeholder  engagement  (GRI,  AA1000,  ISO  26000).  The  first step  involved  listing  28  topics  on  which  stakeholders  were consulted  through  a  quantitative  survey  and  interviews.\n\nVery high\n\nAlmost  70  external  stakeholders  (investors,  suppliers  and business partners,  distributors  and  clients,  civil  society,  local communities  and  NGOs,  academics,  public  authorities  and regulators,  peers,  professional  organizations  and  innovators) and  internal  stakeholders  (management,  top  management at  Kering  and  its  Houses,  functional  departments)  were consulted.  A  steering  committee  made  up  of  members  of the  Group's  main  functional  departments  were  involved throughout  the  project,  which  was  supported  by  a  team  of independent consultants.\n\n## 1.3.1.2 Analysis of results\n\nKering's materiality matrix includes 28 topics with high overall importance, broken down into four categories: planet, people (labor  relations  and  societal  topics),  profit  (business)  and governance.  These  topics  are  arranged  in  a  three-level hierarchy,  which  provides  useful  information  that  allows  the Group to better understand, manage and prioritize its actions in the short and medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IMPORTANCE FOR KERING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlanet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## S T A K E H O L D E R E X P E C T A T I O N S\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople\n\nGovernance\n\nProfit\n\nCore challenges\n\nMajor challenges\n\nCrucial challenges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe results of the assessment confirm that Kering's strategic pillars  defined  in  its  2025  Sustainability  Strategy  and  its business  model,  as  well  as  the  commitments  made  since 2020,  are  consistent  with  the  expectations  of  external stakeholders. These topics are covered by action plans and key performance indicators as part of Kering's 2025 Sustainability Strategy (see the progress table on the Sustainability Strategy and  Kering's  contribution  to  the  United  Nations  Sustainable Development Goals in section 1.4).\n\nProviding  insight  into  the  perceived  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  the  2020  stakeholder  consultation  indicated  that the  pandemic  was  an  accelerating  factor,  bringing  to  the forefront  topics  that  had  emerged  as  important  in  previous years, especially biodiversity and climate change, and driving the  need  for  faster  action.  Employee  well-being  also  stands out as a major focus for businesses in terms of dealing with the  pandemic  and  developing  new  ways  of  working.  On  a longer-term  perspective,  stakeholders  identified  four  topics that are gaining traction: biodiversity, sustainable procurement  and  responsible  supplier  relations,  employee well-being, and cybersecurity.\n\nThe  results  are  also  closely  linked  to  trends  impacting  the luxury  goods  market.  Generations  Y  (1981-1995)  and  Z (>1995),  with  their  demand  for  innovative  products  and heightened awareness of social and environmental issues, are driving  the  Group  to  accelerate  its  transformation  and increase transparency.\n\nIn  2022,  Kering  took  part  in  several  intra-and  inter-company working  groups  specifically  aimed  at  gaining  an  in-depth understanding  of  expectations  and  future  obligations  under the  CSRD  (Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive)  and the future ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards),  particularly  regarding  the  concept  of  double materiality (i.e. \"inside-out\" regarding the Group's impacts and \"outside-in' regarding financial impacts on the Group).\n\n## 1.3.2 Stakeholder interaction with the Group and its Houses\n\nTo stay closely attuned to its stakeholders' priority challenges and  contribute  to  the  movement  toward  more  sustainable luxury,  Kering  has  defined  a  policy  based  on  dialogue  and analysis  of  stakeholder  expectations  at  the  Group  level,  and encourages each House to develop its own dialogue at a more operational level.\n\nAccordingly,  beyond  its  materiality  assessment,  Kering  takes action  at  the  local,  national  and  international  levels  and participates  in  many  initiatives  and  associations  with  its stakeholders or as part of multi-party stakeholder coalitions. Kering has developed a dedicated factsheet, available on the Group's website, that gives a non-exhaustive overview of the materiality analysis and the main expectations identified and the ways in which the Group interacts with each stakeholder category.\n\n## 1.3.3 Non-financial risk assessment\n\nEach  year,  Kering  carries  out  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  risks that the Group may face, including non-financial risks liable to jeopardize its ability to maintain its overall performance. The approach  as  a  whole  and,  in  general,  all  aspects  relating  to risks, are presented in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRisks relating to the categories included in the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) as defined in Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code - environment, social/societal, human rights, corruption and tax evasion - are accordingly an integral  part  of  the  Group's  overall  risk  identification  and management process, and as such are described in Chapter 5 of this document.\n\nThe  Sustainability  department  is  involved  in  the  process  of identifying and classifying the risks that fall within its scope. This risk assessment extends beyond Kering's operations and covers  the  entire  value  chain  from  the  sourcing  of  raw materials  to  the  use  of  products  made  by  the  Group's Houses,  fully  consistent  with  the  materiality  matrix,  the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  and  other  analytical  work conducted  by  Kering,  including  the  EP&L.  As  a  result,  nine principal risks out of the NFIS categories have been identified.\n\nThis dual approach - the analysis of risks that could challenge the  Group's  ability  to  maintain  its  performance,  and  the materiality analysis to identify the main issues in driving value creation  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  internal  and external  stakeholders  -  allows  the  Group  to  identify  its sustainability priorities clearly.\n\nThe  policies  and  actions  implemented  within  the  Group,  the outcomes  obtained  and  the  related  performance  indicators are detailed in this NFIS.",

1.5 Sustainability governance and organization\n\nKering's Sustainability Department  defines the Group's sustainability strategy and policies. It is supported and guided by  the  Sustainability  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors. The department is responsible for the implementation of the Sustainability strategy at the corporate level and supports the Houses. More than 100 individuals throughout the Group have a dedicated  sustainability  role,  working  for  the  Kering Sustainability Department at the Corporate level, the Houses' Sustainability teams, and in dedicated structures such as the Material Innovation Lab (MIL) and the Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL). This organization encourages permanent cooperation between the Group and its Houses, with support for  operational  functions  and  for  the  creation  of  working parties  and  cross-business  committees  on  the  Group's commitments and flagship projects.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Sustainability Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  consisted  of  eight Directors  as  of  March  2,  2023  (Emma  Watson,  Committee Chairwoman;  V\u00e9ronique  Weill;  Concetta  Battaglia;  Yonca Dervisoglu; Daniela Riccardi; Jean-Pierre Denis; Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer;  and  JeanFran\u00e7ois Palus, Group Managing Director). It met on November 17, 2022 in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 review progress toward the 2025 objectives;\n\n- \u00b7 discuss the Group's policies and outcomes in the areas of climate,  biodiversity,  human  rights,  ethics,  animal  welfare and circular economy;\n- \u00b7 consider  Kering's  ESG  performance  and  new  regulations regarding sustainability reporting;\n- \u00b7 address  the  Group's  carbon  strategy  and  the  initiatives needed  to  strengthen  the  mechanisms  for  taking  climate change  risks  into  account  throughout  the  value  chain, particularly with the Group's suppliers;\n- \u00b7 monitor the progress achieved by the Kering Foundation's actions to combat violence against women.\n\nSince  2019,  there  has  been  a  Lead  Independent  Director  on the  Board  of  Directors  whose  role  includes,  in  coordination with the Chairman, representing the Board in its dealings with investors  concerning  ESG  matters.  In  2022,  Sustainability Committee  member  Jean-Pierre  Denis  was  appointed  as Climate  Change  Lead.  In  coordination  with  the  Chair  of  the Sustainability Committee and the Lead Independent Director, the Climate Change Lead's role includes ensuring that climate issues  are  considered  by  the  Board  as  part  of  a  long-term approach.  Their  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  are described in sections 1.5.2 and 1.6 of chapter 3.\n\nIn 2022, Kering also set up a Sustainable Finance department; details about this department's remit are featured in section 5.2.",

        "page_content": "Aside  from  the  remuneration  of  executive  corporate  officers (see  Chapter  3  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document), a growing number of Kering's entities incorporate sustainability  into  performance-related  pay  targets  for  their employees  and  managers.  For  example,  for  the  fourth consecutive year in 2022, all Bottega Veneta employees were involved  in  an  inclusive  approach  to  setting  sustainability targets for their activities. As a further illustration, Balenciaga France entered into a three-year incentive agreement in 2020 under  which  employees  are  given  a  financial  interest  in reaching sustainability and profitability targets.\n\nIn  addition,  all  members  of  the  Group  Luxury  Committee, notably  including  the  two  executive  corporate  officers, members of the Group Executive Committee and the Houses' CEOs, took part in a Climate Fresk.\n\nIn  2022,  for  the  fourth  consecutive  year,  Kering  held  an  ESG roadshow for key investors, organized with the assistance and presence  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director.  In  addition,  a roundtable  on  sustainability  was  held  as  part  of  Capital Markets Day 2022, an event aimed at the financial community.\n\nThe Group's internal sustainability network remained particularly active in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Network Meeting (SNM) took place online every six weeks, bringing together the sustainability teams from  the  Group,  the  Houses,  and  dedicated  entities  to present  the  Group's  developments  in  the  field,  share  best practice and spur thinking on new issues, sometimes with the help of external experts. In 2022, meetings focused on new  business  models,  eliminating  single-use  plastics, sustainable  finance,  biodiversity,  climate  change,  public policy and COP27, as well as stakeholder engagement.\n- \u00b7 The  two-day  Sustainability  Network  Conference  (SNC)  was attended  by  more  than  140  people  from  all  of  the Houses'  business  areas.  Speakers  included  author  and environmental  activist  Rob  Hopkins,  Executive  Director Sustainability  and  Secretary  General  of  the  Fashion  Pact Eva von Alvensleblen, CEO of the Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030 Iris van der Veken, and CEO of Business for Inclusive Growth  Camille  Putois.  Discussions  concerned  the  future of  sustainable  luxury,  covering  topics  such  as next-gen materials ,  the  role  of  industry  coalitions  and  responsible technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6 Recognition and inclusion in ESG indices\n\nAs an extension of its commitment to transparency, each year Kering  responds  to  or  is  included  in  more  than  60 solicitations, questionnaires and requests from rating agencies,  NGOs  and  non-financial  assessment  bodies  on  its ESG  (environmental,  social  and  governance)  performance  or on  specific  topics  (Good  on  You,  CHRB,  WDI,  etc.).

        "page_content": "## 2 ETHICS, THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR BUSINESS\n\n## 2.1 How we see ethics\n\n## 2.1.1 General framework, guiding principles and key commitments\n\nThe  strong  values  embraced  by  Kering  and  its  Houses  are expressed  through  their  products  and  form  a  solid  basis  for trust-based  relationships  with  clients,  employees  and  the Group's  stakeholders  in  general.  To  ensure  that  these  values permeate its operations and ceaselessly nurture a sustainable climate of trust and successful performance across the Group, Kering  is  firmly  committed  to  ethical  behavior  in  all  its activities  and  business  relationships.  Kering  is  fully  aware  of its  duty  to  adopt extensive ethical responsibilities and to act at Group and House level, and with its suppliers and business partners,  in  such  a  way  as  to  promote  the  highest  ethical standards in all circumstances, and to resolutely identify and effectively handle any situation likely to involve risk in terms of  ethics  or  respect  for  human rights. This firm commitment starts  at  the  top,  with  Executive  Management  and  the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors. To ensure that  this  commitment  is  actively  taken  up  throughout  the Group and its  Houses,  Kering  draws  upon  its  Code  of  Ethics, the  key  document  which  unpacks  the  principles  behind  the Group's internal and external actions. Furthermore, a compliance  program  is  built  on  this  commitment  with  a dedicated organization tasked with developing and overseeing implementation.  It  is  led  by  the  Group  Chief  Compliance Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the  Group  Audit  Committee. These arrangements form an integral part of Kering's internal control system,  ensuring  a  strong  culture  of  integrity throughout  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  and  providing  all employees  with  a  solid  framework  for  action  along  with  all necessary  resources  and  support  to  clarify  any  ethics  issue. They  also  give  employees  a  confidential  way  of  reporting potential  breaches,  and  ensures  that  any  such  reports  are dealt  with  promptly  and  fairly.  It  ensures  that  the  Group complies  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  including French Laws no. 2016-1691, known as Sapin II,  no. 2017-399 on  the  Duty  of  Care  and  no.  2022-401,  known  as  the Waserman Law, which came into force in fall 2022.\n\n## 2.1.2 Organization of ethics and compliance within the Group\n\nThe Group's ethics organization is  coordinated  and  overseen by  the  Kering  Executive  Committee,  under  the  guidance  of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Initially  consisting  of  a  single  body  -  the  Ethics  and\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility Committee (ECSRC), set up in 2005 - the ethics organization has since late 2013 drawn on the  work  of  three  Ethics  Committees:  one  Group  Committee and  two  regional  Committees  (Asia-Pacific  and  Americas). These Committees are therefore part of the Group's policy of delegating responsibility,  with  bodies  that  can  act  effectively in  the  light  of  actual  operating  conditions,  within  a  shared reference  framework  applied  throughout  the  Group.  Each  of the  three  Committees  is  made  up  of  representatives  from Kering and its Houses to ensure greater diversity in terms of nationality, gender  and  role.  In 2022, 53%  of  these committees' members were women. The Committees focus on three main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring that the Code of Ethics is up to date and that it effectively reaches all Group employees;\n- \u00b7 to generate proposals on appropriate updates to the Code and  on  the  implementation  of  appropriate  behavior  and practices;\n- \u00b7 dealing  with  alerts  received  as  part  of  the  Kering whistleblowing system.\n\nEmployees  can  also  contact  the  Ethics  Committee  of  their choice  to  request  clarification  or  ask  questions  on  the interpretation of the Code, if they are unsure how to behave in a specific situation.\n\nThe Compliance structure, which was put in place in 2015, is coordinated  by  a  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  (CCO), responsible for implementing the Group Compliance Program as approved by the Board of Directors. Appointed in 2015 by Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Compliance  Officer  reports  to  the  Audit  Committee,  which helps  ensure  the  independence  required  of  that  role. The Group Chief Compliance Officer also has direct access to the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  does  not  hold any other position, so is fully focused on this role. To ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of the Compliance  Program,  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  is supported by (i) a team of six compliance lawyers working in Paris,  Singapore  and  Shanghai,  (ii)  a  network  of  Brand Compliance Officers appointed by the House CEOs, and (iii) a network  of  Regional  and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  In  some Houses,  there  are  compliance  managers  in  addition  to  the Brand  and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  As  a  general  rule,  the positions held by the Compliance Officers in parallel with their compliance duties are sufficiently high-ranking to ensure they have the necessary authority and independence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering's Code  of  Ethics  was  first  introduced  in  2005,  and  underwent major updates in 2009 and 2013. The latest update, in 2018, was  issued  to  all  employees  in  2019.  To  ensure  the  fullest possible  employee  understanding  and  take-up  of  Kering's values  and  ethical  standards,  the  new  version  of  the  Code, reissued in 2019, is now available in 14 languages. The latest update  focused  chiefly  on  strengthening  commitments regarding  personnel  and  the  behavior  expected  of  everyone, and on Group measures and policies brought in following the introduction  of  new  legislation  and  regulations,  such  as France's  Sapin  II  Law.  The  Suppliers'  Charter  included  in  the Code of Ethics was updated at the same time, with particular regard to the question of human rights. In addition, the Code of Ethics now extends to the commitments of members of the Executive  Committee  as  well  as  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer, and has been presented to and reviewed by the Kering Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  is  the  cornerstone  of  Kering's  ethical commitments. It aims to comply with the major international reference  texts  (such  as  the  United  Nations  Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  European  Convention  on Human  Rights,  the  main  conventions  of  the  International Labour  Organization,  the  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multinational Enterprises,  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of the  Child,  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business and  Human  Rights  and  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact) and demonstrates how the Group continually strengthens its commitments and the systems in place to ensure compliance. For Kering, Sustainability is not possible without the Code of Ethics, which is used as the sole set of standards implemented by everyone in all parts of the Group, regardless of their level of responsibility, position or location.\n\nThe Code of Ethics is available on the Group's intranet, and on Kering's website for readers outside the Group.\n\n## 2.2.2 System for detecting and preventing corruption and influence-peddling\n\nKering's Code of Ethics emphasizes that employees must at all times act with integrity, loyalty and a sense of responsibility. It  clearly  sets  out  the  Group's  commitment to zero tolerance on corruption and  influence-peddling, and  encourages employees to report any instance of misconduct. It stipulates the necessity of avoiding conflicts of interest, any risk of which must be promptly identified and resolved.\n\nTo apply these commitments in an effective way and ensure full compliance with the stipulations of France's Sapin II Law, a  corruption  risk  map  was  drawn  up  in  2017  under  the supervision  of  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  who submitted  the  results  of  the  mapping  exercise  and  ensuing action plans to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in its meeting of June 7, 2017.\n\nAs  detailed  in  the  section  on  'Fraud  and  corruption  risks'  in Chapter  5,  a  new  in-depth  assessment  of  corruption  and influence-peddling risks was undertaken across the Group and each of its Houses worldwide in 2019. To ensure that the risk assessment  was  comprehensive,  each  potential  corruption and  influence-peddling  scenario  relevant  to  the  Group  was identified and  assessed  after analyzing existing first-, second-and third-level controls. The corruption and influence-peddling risks associated with these scenarios were rated  and  ranked  in  a  risk  map.  The  action  plan  adopted following  this  risk  mapping  exercise  was  rolled  out  in  2021. The update to the corruption and influence-peddling risk map was completed during 2021 and the action plan resulting from that update was implemented  in 2022. Second-level compliance  audits  to  ensure  the  proper  implementation  of the compliance program and detect corruption and influence-peddling risks are carried out on and off site by the Group  Compliance  Department,  with  the  support  of  an international  law  firm  to  reinforce  the  independence  and expertise  of  the  analysis  in  the  most  at-risk  jurisdictions identified in the risk map.\n\n## 2.2.2.1 Steering\n\nIn 2016,  Kering  developed  and  implemented  an  anticorruption  policy,  standing  alongside  the  Code  of  Ethics  to offer employees fuller guidance in their everyday practices and ensure a firm grip on corruption risks. This policy, which was updated in 2019 under an action plan drawn up as a result of the 2019 risk map, identifies prohibited behavior and sets out guidelines enabling employees  to  detect  instances  of corruption and report them to management. The Group Chief Compliance  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the  Audit Committee,  independently  of  the  Houses  and  support functions, is responsible for implementing the anti-corruption policy under the Group Compliance Program. The deployment of the anti-corruption policy is monitored closely by the Audit Committee and Executive Management.",

        "page_content": "The  policy  extends  to  specific  procedures  on  the  following subjects:\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment\n\nThe procedure on gifts, hospitality and entertainment sets out rules on the giving and receiving of gifts and invitations within the Group.\n\nPrior  written  authorization  from  the  relevant  Compliance Officer  is  required  whenever  a  gift  or  invitation  involves  a public official or is of significant value.\n\nThe  procedure  on  gifts,  hospitality  and  entertainment  was updated in 2019.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on third-party due diligence\n\nThis procedure, introduced in 2015 and updated in 2019, sets out  the  principles  and  rules  applicable  to  the  due  diligence required with regard to third parties with which the Group is considering entering into a business relationship (distributors, direct  and  indirect  suppliers,  joint  venture  partners,  etc.). The degree of due diligence required depends on the objective risk profile of the third party in question and any specific risks that  may  have  been  identified  during  the  assessment. In  certain  cases,  compliance  questionnaires  are  sent  to  the third parties concerned,  in  order  to  obtain  additional information  and  carry  out  more  in-depth  analysis  based  on that information.\n\nTo assist the Compliance Officers and other Group employees involved  in  assessing  third  parties  under  this  procedure, Kering works with a service provider specializing in third-party due diligence.\n\n## \u00b7 Prior verification procedure on the prevention of corruption in merger and acquisition operations\n\nThe  prior  verification  procedure  on  the  prevention  of corruption in merger and acquisition operations, introduced in 2016,  requires  a  prior  evaluation  of  the  third  parties concerned by the transaction. As is the case for the procedure on third-party due diligence, this procedure specifies different degrees  of  verification  depending  on  the  compliance  risks identified.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on donations and sponsorship\n\nUnder  a  specific Group  procedure,  all  donations  and sponsorships granted by the Group to third-party individuals or  organizations  require  prior  written  approval  from  the relevant  Compliance  Officer.  The  procedure  was  updated  in 2019.\n\nSince  August  22,  2017,  the  Group  has  been  listed  on  the register  of  the  French  government's  Haute  Autorit\u00e9  pour  la Transparence de la Vie Publique, and complies with all ethical and disclosure requirements stipulated by French law on the matter.\n\n## \u00b7 Procedure on conflicts of interest\n\nIn 2016, Kering brought in a specific procedure on conflicts of interest, which requires employees to report any connections, relationships  or  other  situations  that  give  rise  or  may potentially  give  rise  to  a  conflict  of  interest,  by  signing  a specific  declaration  and  discussing  the  situation  with  their managers.  A  campaign  takes  place  each  year  to  collect declarations  of  conflicts  of  interests  across  a  specific  set  of employees.\n\nSeveral  procedures,  including  that  on  the  involvement  of suppliers in the production chain, refer to this procedure and invite employees involved in decision-making processes with regard  to  third  parties  to  report  any  potential  conflicts  of interest.\n\n## 2.2.2.2 Guidelines\n\nIn addition to the anti-corruption policy and  related procedures, the Group Compliance Department also provides additional advice to Compliance Officers and Group employees through the regular issue of guidelines on specific compliance matters. Specific guidelines issued so far cover topics such as interactions  with  public  officials,  third-party  due  diligence, discounts  granted  to  certain  business  partners,  discounts granted to employees, real estate transactions, consignment, human  resources,  and  analysis  of  gifts,  hospitality,  and donations and sponsorship.\n\n## 2.2.2.3 System for detecting and preventing money laundering\n\nIn accordance with its Social Responsibility objectives, in 2021 Kering  adopted  and  implemented  a  Group  Policy  (the  'AML Policy')  to  reduce  money-laundering  risks  and  strengthen  its systems  in  this  area.  An  updated  version  of  this  policy  is currently  being  deployed.  It  defines  rules  for  carrying  out checks relating to the Houses' selling activities, online and in store,  rules  for  transactions  considered  at-risk,  and  specific rules  in  each  country  where  Houses  have  selling  activities. These  have  been  listed  in  dedicated  country  sheets  to facilitate  their  implementation  by  Group  sales  employees. The Kering Compliance Department has already trained more than 2,000 employees worldwide in the application of the AML Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To prevent non-compliance risks as far as possible,  a  specific  Sanctions  Policy  was  adopted  and deployed  by  the  Group  in  2016,  and  was  updated  most recently  in  2022.  The  Policy  aims  to  inform  and  guide employees in regards to fulfilling the Group's obligations and in  particular  carrying  out  related  checks.  To  enable  the implementation of this Policy, the Group has produced a guide setting  out  the  measures  that  need  to  be  taken  to  ensure compliance  with  sanctions  against  Russia  and  Belarus.  The guide  was  first  published  in  March  2022  and  updated  in January  2023  and  details  the  measures  that  each  sales channel and department must take to identify risky situations, block problematic or prohibited transactions and report them to their hierarchy.\n\n## 2.2.3 Whistleblowing procedure for reporting unethical conduct\n\nIntroduced  in  2005,  Kering's  whistleblowing  system  was strengthened in 2018 to ensure full compliance with France's Sapin II  Law.  The  system  is  currently  being  updated  to  meet new requirements under France's Waserman Law. It is accessible\n\nto all employees and interns of the Group and its Houses, and external and temporary personnel working for external partners or service providers under contract with the Group or its Houses. Once it has been updated, it will also be open to people whose working relationship with the Group has ended (where information has been obtained in the course of that relationship), people who  have  applied  for  a  job  at  the  entity  concerned  (where information  has  been  obtained  during  the  application process) and other external and occasional employees.\n\nThe  Group's  whistleblowing  system  makes  it  possible  for people  to  submit  concerns  via  their  direct  or  indirect  line manager,  the  Human  Resources  Department,  employees representatives  or  employer  (local  reporting),  via  their  Group Chief Compliance Officer and network of Compliance Officers (Local  Compliance  Officers  and  Brand  Compliance  Officers), or  via  Ethics  Committees,  which  may  be  contacted  by  email or through the hotline (central reporting). The system may be used to report any of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a criminal offense;\n- \u00b7 a violation of, or an attempt to violate, a law or regulation;\n- \u00b7 conduct  or  a  situation  contrary  to  the  Group's  Code  of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 a threat or harm to the general interest.\n\nAt all levels of the Group, the way in which reports are handled is  intended  to  comply  with  the  key  principles,  including confidentiality  and  the  absence  of  retaliation.  Kering  is committed  to  protecting whistleblowers, and explicitly prohibits any form of retaliation against them. This protection is clearly stated in the annual e-learning module on the Code of Ethics.\n\n## 2.3 Promoting and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond\n\n## 2.3.1 Fostering a culture of integrity\n\nA training program on ethics and the related Code, known as the  'Ethics  &  Compliance  e-learning  program',  has  been established for all Group employees worldwide and has been implemented since 2014.\n\nAvailable in 15 languages, it sets out the ethical ground rules in  place  at  Kering  and  presents  case  studies  and  ethical dilemmas  that  help  employees  ask  themselves  the  right questions.  The  e-learning  program  is  updated  annually,  and covers all the principles upheld by the Group's Code of Ethics by alternating between practical examples that allow a variety of  subjects  to  be  covered  over  time  (conflicts  of  interest, inclusion and diversity, respect for human rights, harassment, environmental protection, fraud, etc.), while tackling corruption  is  a  mandatory  topic  each  year.  As  in  previous years,  employees  were  reminded  of  the  existence  and operation  of  the  Group's  whistleblowing  system  and  its  key features  (notably  the  respect  for  confidentiality  in  the treatment  of  cases  and  the  ban  on  any  reprisals  against whistleblowers).\n\nEach  year,  the  launch  of  the  annual  training  campaign  is headed by Kering's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who directly addresses all Group employees through a video address\n\nhighlighting  the  importance  to  the  Group  of  a  culture  of integrity in the conduct of its business and in the day-to-day roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  employees.  The  training session  had  been  delivered  to  96.5%  of  Kering  employees worldwide  by  year-end  2022,  up  from  96.4%  in  2021  and 95.1% in 2020.\n\nKering's Compliance  Officers  also  benefit  from  regular personalized training, and the Group's internal auditors have been  trained  on  the  key  factors  involved  in  assessing anti-corruption procedures. The Group's Compliance Department also  delivers  regular  on-site  training  courses  to  educate employees about corruption risks. More than 3,500 employees worldwide took one of these courses in 2022.\n\nAs  well  as  providing  training,  Kering  also  runs  an  ongoing program to  inform  employees  and  managers  and  raise  their awareness about ethics. All new recruits are issued with a copy of  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  are  required  to  follow  the  ethics training program for the current year. This establishes a sound basis  for  a  culture  of  ethics  and  integrity  as  soon  as employees start working for Kering.\n\nThe Group's intranet includes an Ethics & Compliance section in  French  and  English,  giving  ready  access  to  policies  and procedures, along with a list of  compliance managers at the Houses and structures.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3.2 Relationships with business partners\n\nSince  2013,  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  has  included  the  Group Suppliers'  Charter,  which  sets  out  in  detail  Kering's  specific expectations  of  its  business  partners  on  ethics,  social  and environmental issues.\n\nFor  any  contractor  working  for  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses, notwithstanding any contractual clauses, compliance with the Charter  is  a  precondition  of  the  business  relationship.  The Group  requires  its  suppliers  to  commit  formally  to  applying high  ethical  standards  themselves  and  to  ensuring  the preservation of human rights.\n\nSince 2018, the Group's whistleblowing system has also been open to employees of the suppliers and service providers with which Kering and its Houses have direct business relationships.  All  suppliers  and  service  providers  have  been informed  accordingly.  In  2020,  Kering  decided  to  go  a  step further  by  adopting  a  Group-wide  communication  campaign aimed  directly  at  the  employees  concerned,  to  ensure  that they are fully informed.\n\nTranslated  into  15  languages,  the  campaign  took  two  forms: displays  at  relevant  locations  within  supplier  and  serviceprovider sites in order to gain the greatest visibility (cafeteria, locker rooms, site entrance, etc.), and a prospectus to be given directly to employees. Both the poster and the flyer listed the six key ethical principles: compliance  with  laws  and regulations;  prohibition  of  any  form  of  corruption,  fraud, money  laundering  or  conflict  of  interest;  respect  for  human rights  and  fundamental  freedoms;  protection  of  the  health and safety of all; respect for the integrity and dignity of all; and protection  of  the  environment.  The  level  of  detail  was adjusted  depending  on  the  recipients,  to  give  specific examples  of  what  was  expected  in  each  case  (including  in particular the refusal of forced labor, the refusal of recruitment fees paid by employees, special attention paid to\n\nvulnerable people, access to suitable washroom facilities and to decent dormitory conditions where  applicable, the availability  of  pay  and  personal  documentation,  respect  for privacy, access to appropriate personal protective equipment, etc.).\n\nAs well as setting out the key points requiring compliance at all locations, both documents also reminded employees of the whistleblowing system and how to use it.\n\nLastly, to provide all employees, depending on their locations and  profiles,  with  access  to  documentation  in  their  own language(s),  an  internet  platform  was  developed  allowing them  to  download  documents  in  any  of  the  15  languages available. An email information campaign targeting employees was also organized by the Group Ethics Committee, with full backing  from  the  CEOs  of  all  the  Group's  Houses.  This information  and  communication  campaign  will  be  refreshed regularly  to  cover  all  new  suppliers  and  service  providers  of the  Group  and  its  Houses.  The  supplier  workforce-related audits  conducted  each  year  include  checks  on  the  effective circulation of this information to all employees (awareness of the system, display and issue of the documentation, etc.).\n\nThe  Group's  supplier  selection  criteria  include  ethical,  social and environmental aspects, the assessment of which must be documented. This assessment is part of the Hercules system, through which Kering oversees and ensures the compliance of its  suppliers.  Supplier  qualification  is  conditional  on  positive findings in the audits regarding ethical, social and environmental  aspects,  which  are  carried  out  by  Kering supply-chain  audit  and  security  teams.  After  qualification, suppliers'  continued  compliance  with  Kering  requirements  is verified by follow-up audits.\n\nSection 4 \"Working together to build sustainable and socially responsible  supply  chains'  provides  details  of  the  Group Suppliers'  Charter  and  the  conditions  for  applying  the Sustainability  Principles  in  supply  chains,  along  with  the findings of audits and assessments carried out in 2022.\n\n## 2.4 Impact of policies and initiatives\n\n## 2.4.1 Complaints addressed to the Ethics Committees\n\nIn  2022,  Kering's  three  Ethics  Committees handled a total of 70  requests,  including  65  complaints  and  five  inquiries (questions and  requests  for  clarification). Out of the 65  complaints,  43  (66%)  were  submitted  to  Committees directly (by email) and 22 (34%) via the Group's ethics hotline; 24 were submitted anonymously.\n\nOut  of  the  same  65  complaints,  51  gave  rise  to  an investigation  by  the  Committee  contacted,  three  complaints were awaiting assessment by the Committees and 11 were not\n\ninvestigated  because  the  reported  allegations  could  not  be audited, because the plaintiffs wished to remain anonymous despite the fact that the reported allegations concerned their personal situations, or because of a lack of response or follow-up by the person who made the complaint, making it impossible to  proceed  with  an  investigation  of  their  personal  situation. 49 complaints had been closed by December 31, 2022 and the remaining  16  (mostly  those  reported  late  in  the  year)  were still under investigation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

More  specifically,  12  complaints  concerned harassment, one concerned discrimination and four concerned a combination of the two.\n\nOf the 49 cases treated and closed as of December 31, 2022, 13 breaches  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  were  identified,  including  12 relating  to  behavior  and  management  issues,  and  appropriate remedial action was taken in each instance. For example, after a  line  manager  was  found  to  have  acted  in  an  inappropriate way, his contract was terminated by the House concerned. As regards to the rest of the investigations carried out and closed\n\n## 2.5 Protection of human rights\n\n## Focus on: Kering's Human Rights Policy\n\nThe publication of a Human Rights Policy in 2021, covering all of Kering's operations as well as its supply chain, not only clarified certain undertakings formalized in the Code of Ethics and Suppliers' Charter, but also resulted in an update to the Sustainability  Principles,  a  key  document  for  suppliers.  This  process  was  accompanied  by  revisions  to  the  social questionnaire  on  the  vendor  portal  for  suppliers,  in  order  to  clarify  items  or  add  new  elements  (for  example  grievance mechanism, the refusal of recruitment fees paid by employees, and community benefit initiatives) enabling them to selfreport certain data points in the area. In 2022, Kering continued to implement this policy among employees, particularly through a specific module as part of the Ethics & Compliance training.\n\nas of December 31, 2022 that did not reveal any breach of the Code of Ethics, some areas for improvement were nevertheless identified, particularly regarding communication and  management.  As  a  result,  43%  of  cases  resulted  in recommendations for operational improvements being issued by the investigating Committee.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that ethics reporting and key figures are  shared  each  year  with  the  Group's  Top  Management  and the  Sustainability  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all information having previously been anonymized and stripped of personal information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  includes complying  with  the  principles  set  out  in  the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).\n\nThis commitment to respecting human rights throughout the Group and its supply chains is reflected in and expanded upon in its key reference documents as shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore specifically, the Code of Ethics draws on the Group's key founding  principles  in  the  area  of  ethics,  which  are  then expressed  in  greater  detail  in  other  policies  and  documents. The contents of these policies and systems are set out in the relevant sections of the present NFIS; they may  be complemented  by  each  House's  individual  or  sector-specific initiatives  (see  section  2.5.2.5).  Kering's  approach  to  the protection  of  human  rights  may  be  accessed  on  the  Kering website,  which  also  contains  its  publications  under  the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, the UK Modern  Slavery  Act  2015,  the  Australian  Modern  Slavery  Act 2018 and Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of May 17, 2017 on metals and ores from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. In addition, Kering's Duty of Care plan, drawn up in compliance with French Law no. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of  Care,  is  outlined  in  the  'Duty  of  care  plan'  section  of Chapter 5 in this document.\n\n## 2.5.2 Implementation within the Group: objectives and actions\n\n## 2.5.2.1 A continuous improvement approach\n\nAware  of  the  need  for  constant  vigilance  on  the  matter  of respect for human rights, the Ethics Charter adopted by Kering in 1996 consolidated key principles to guide employees both in  their  day-to-day  activities  and  in  the  Group's  business relationships. These principles, now set out in Kering's Code of Ethics,  are  regularly  updated  to  bring  clarifications  and explanations as part of a continuous improvement process.\n\nIn  the  same  vein,  the  due  diligence  procedure  aimed  at identifying,  assessing  and  preventing  the  impact  that  Group operations have or might have on human rights in the supply chain is seen as a continuous process with a need for constant adaptation. This procedure is included in the Hercules system, which is described in section 4.2.1.\n\nAs outlined in the 'Duty of care plan' section of chapter 5, in 2017 the Group carried out a risk mapping procedure covering Kering's  operations  and  its  supply  chains.  In  2021,  Kering conducted a new, more in-depth evaluation of risks pertaining to severe  impacts  on  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms,  health  and  safety,  and  the  environment  resulting from the Group's  operations  and  supply  chain.  The  risk  map produced in 2021 will be updated in 2023.\n\nFollowing  on  from  these  initiatives,  various  work  has  been carried out to identify areas for improvement, with a particular focus  on  respect  for  human  rights  throughout  the  supply chain.  A  gap  analysis  was  performed  in  2017  to  pinpoint differences  between  the  Group's  internal  practices  and  the UNGP. The findings of this analysis provided input for the 2019 update  to  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  and  for  a  dedicated communication plan targeting employees of the Group's direct suppliers with specific details on how to use the whistleblowing system. The first phase of this communication campaign  took  place  in  2020,  followed  by  a  campaign  of updates in 2021. It will continue to be monitored on a regular basis to ensure it reaches all new direct suppliers. A detailed description of this plan is provided in section 2.3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Carried  out  with GoodCorporation, an independent organization specializing in business ethics, this study included consultations with various internal  stakeholders  in  order  to  gather  their  feedback. To  identify  new  avenues  for  progress,  the  findings  were analyzed  in  the  light  of  the  recommendations  given  in  the UNGP and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply  Chains  in  the  Garment  and  Footwear  Sector.  Kering also conducted a study aiming to identify and assess human rights  risks  linked  to  the  supply  of  certain  raw  materials. This  analysis  factored  in  aspects  regarding  the  countries from which suppliers operate. Together, these various studies enabled  the  Group  to  identify  a  number  of  key  topics,  and recommendations were shared with members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThis analysis has enabled Kering to update the list of risks that the  Group  considers  salient  with  regard  to  human  rights (notably  forced  labor,  child  labor  in  raw  materials  sourcing, discrimination,  health  and  safety,  living  wages  for  suppliers' employees  and  harassment).  Alongside  this  analysis,  Kering also monitors various human rights risk indicators provided by Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nThe importance of respect for human rights was confirmed by the  materiality  assessment  carried  out  by  the  Group  that identified respect for human rights as a strategic challenge of particular  importance  that  is  central  to  discussions  on preparation  of  its  2025  Strategy,  consistent  with  the  United Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  The  consultation conducted in 2020 confirmed that respect for human rights is among  the  crucial  challenges  facing  the  Group  (see  section 1.3).\n\nThe  non-financial  risk  'Human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms'  was  also  identified  in  the  Group's  overall  risk analysis, as presented in Chapter 5 of this document.\n\nFinally, to strengthen its approach regarding social impact in its supply chain, Kering has set up a social impact team within its  Sustainability  Department.  This  team  works  with  various internal  and  external  stakeholders  to  measure  the  social footprint of the Group's suppliers and provide input for action plans adopted by the Houses and the Group in this area.\n\n## 2.5.2.2 Ambitions incorporated into the Group's 2025 Sustainability Strategy\n\nIn  2017,  Kering  published  its  2025  Sustainability  Strategy. The  strategy  rests  on  three  pillars,  two  of  which  include human  rights  objectives.  Through  the  Care  pillar,  Kering commits  to  achieving  100%  implementation  by  suppliers  of the strict requirements set out in the Kering Standards for raw materials  and  manufacturing  processes  by  2025.  These include  standards  on  traceability,  animal  welfare,  use  of\n\nchemicals,  environmental  impact  and  social  impact.  Though the  Collaborate  pillar,  relating  to  Kering's  strategic  social commitments, is not exclusively about human rights, it does include these six related points:\n\n- \u00b7 support  the  continuation  of  craftsmanship  traditions  and the communities that support them;\n- \u00b7 extend  focus  across  the  supply  chain  and  improve livelihoods  in  the  communities  where  raw  materials  are sourced;\n- \u00b7 increase its use of forward-thinking employment practices, including  the  global  parental  policy,  a  well-being  at  work policy, and an employee benefits policy;\n- \u00b7 promote  an  inclusive  work  environment,  and  achieve gender parity and pay equity at all levels;\n- \u00b7 develop innovative career paths for all;\n- \u00b7 become the employer of choice in the Luxury sector.\n\n## 2.5.2.3 Shared governance and central systems rolled out at Group level\n\nKering  takes  a  cross-functional  approach  to  governance  in relation  to  human  rights  issues,  integrated  into  its  overall governance  structure  for  sustainability  (see  section  1.5). Human rights governance spans various departments, starting with Compliance, Human Resources (including the Inclusion & Diversity department that reports to it), Sustainability, Internal Audit and Security. It also extends to employee representative bodies.\n\nHuman  rights  considerations  are  included  in  the  annual performance appraisals of Group executive officers. 30% of the annual  variable  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and of the Group Managing Director is linked to  the  fulfillment  of  non-financial  criteria,  including  the operational roll-out of the 2025 Sustainability Strategy.\n\nFor many years now, Kering's commitments on human rights have  also  been  expressed  through  the  Kering  Foundation, which was set up in 2008 and focuses on combating violence against  women  (see  section  6.3.1).  The  Group's  Houses  are also committed to this purpose.\n\nA vendor  portal has been  created  to  help  optimize communication between Kering and its suppliers. It provides suppliers  with  ready  access  to  training  and  key  Kering documents - including  on  human  rights  -  but  also  to  allow for  greater  transparency  on  supply  chains.  Via  this  portal, suppliers are required to complete three annual questionnaires (on the implementation  of  the  Kering Standards,  labor  relations  management  and  environmental management). Their responses will be used to evaluate their practices.  The  social  questionnaire,  which  contained  97 questions  in  2022,  seeks  increased  transparency  on  the supplier's  workforce  (gender  balance,  for  example),  labor relations, management of health and safety (risk assessment, incident rate, etc.), and  measures  for  mitigating  risks concerning forced labor and child labor (see section 4.1.2).",

        "page_content": "## 2.5.2.4 Employee training and education\n\nKering has put in place multiple employee training activities, some of which include various aspects of human rights.\n\n- \u00b7 All  Group  employees  take  a  compulsory  annual  Ethics  & Compliance  course  based  on  the  principles  set  out  in Kering's  Code  of  Ethics.  The  course  is  available  in  the  15 most  widely  spoken  languages  within  the  Group.  The subjects covered vary from year to year, with the objective of ensuring that employees will adopt appropriate behavior when  faced  with  the  ethics  dilemmas  they  might  come across in their everyday working experience. Topics covered in 2022 included child labor, responsible procurement and various  corruption  risks,  with  case  studies  specific  to  the luxury industry. Circularity and Kering's various initiatives in this  area  were  also  covered,  along  with  the  topic  of diversity,  particularly  multigenerational  diversity,  within teams (see section 2.3).\n- \u00b7 Training on the Kering Standards, for employees of Kering, its  Houses and their suppliers, presents Kering's minimum requirements  on  sourcing  and  processes  whilst  providing details,  particularly on social aspects, that provide context showing  why  the  standards  are  necessary  (see  section 4.1.1.4).\n- \u00b7 The Kering Foundation  provides  training for Group employees, helping them to gain a better understanding of the  complexity  and  impact  of  domestic  violence,  and providing  insights  into  ways  to  develop  a  safe  work environment.  In  2020,  a  dedicated  module  was  also included  in  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  training  course (see section 6.3 on the Foundation).\n\n## 2.5.2.5 Initiatives by the Houses\n\nAs part of its committed approach to stakeholders, Kering and its Houses have adopted a number of human rights initiatives. In 2022, new projects started and support for existing projects continued:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Kering  project  for  gender  equality  in  Italy's  Luxury supply  chains,  involving  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega Veneta,  Pomellato  and  Kering  Eyewear  (see  box  in section 4.1.2);\n- \u00b7 The  collaboration  between  Gucci  and  the  Indian  social enterprise I was a Sari, whose mission is to encourage the autonomy  of  underprivileged  Indian  women  through  the production  of  upcycled  products  made  from  used  saris, continued  to  evolve  and  develop.  An  embroidery  training program entitled 'Now I Can', sponsored by Gucci's Chime for  Change  initiative,  has  also  been  available  on  an  open source platform since 2021;\n\n- \u00b7 Kering organized an internal living wage workshop, bringing together  various  Group's  stakeholders  and  its  Houses, aimed at driving collaborative efforts in supply chains while building on existing work;\n- \u00b7 Gucci's  initiative  to  support  the  integration  of  refugees: Gucci's efforts in 2021 were acknowledged in 2022 when it received  the  'Welcome.  Working  for  Refugee  Integration\" award  from  the  United  Nations  High  Commission  on Refugees  (UNHCR).  This  award  recognizes  companies  that stand  out  in  terms  of  working  with  refugees  and  helping them integrate and find employment in Italy;\n- \u00b7 Virtual  training  provided  by  Alexander  McQueen  to  key employees  identified  in  its  ready-to-wear,  shoes,  leather goods and jewelry teams. These training sessions covered topics including social topics and human rights risks in the supply chain.\n\nSome Houses have gained certification for their practices:\n\n- \u00b7 SA8000 (Social  Accountability  8000) certification  for  Gucci (since 2007) and Bottega Veneta (since 2009). Gucci is also a member of the Advisory Board of SAI (Social Accountability International) , which is the organization that developed the SA8000 standard.\n- \u00b7 RJC (Responsible Jewellery Council) certification  attests  to  a company's  respect  for  the  environment  and  working conditions  in  the  jewelry  and  watchmaking  sectors. Pomellato, Dodo, Boucheron and Gucci (also RJC CoC-certified)  are  RJC-certified,  while  Qeelin  is  in  the process of gaining certification.\n\n## 2.5.3 Performance and transparency of the measures taken by the Group to protect human rights\n\nSection  3  sets  out  findings  and  key  performance  indicators concerning the protection of human rights within the Group's operations in terms of human resources, occupational health and  safety,  and  labor  relations.  Section  2.4  describes performance monitoring for the Group's ethics and compliance procedures. The findings of the workforce-related audits carried out within the Group's supply chains in 2022 are presented in section 4.2.3.\n\n- A  cross-reference  table  between  Kering's  human  rights approach and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework  is  available  in  the  Sustainability/Measuring  our impact/Reporting and indicators section of Kering's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering's  principal mission  is  to  help  its  employees  reach  their  potential  and express  their creativity by developing  their  skills and performance in the most imaginative way possible. To achieve this, the  Group  provides  its  Houses  with  the  support necessary  for  their  growth,  promoting  the  sharing  of  and access to best practice, and encouraging the identification and development  of  talent  for  the  benefit  of  all  the  Houses. Kering  encourages internal  mobility,  the  pooling  of  expertise and the creation of synergies.\n\nIn  today's  world  of  fast-changing  markets,  competition  and customer needs, identifying, developing and retaining the best talent is a strategic priority.\n\nKering's  goal  is  to  be  the  preferred  employer  in  the  luxury industry, with empowered, motivated employees who want to\n\nmake a difference in a diverse and open-minded environment. The aim is to continue building a respected Group, one that brings together strong Houses united by a shared culture and sense  of  motivation  and  in  which  every  employee  feels appreciated and committed.\n\nKering continued in 2022 to pursue the HR priorities identified in its 2025 sustainability strategy: to develop talent, preserve craftsmanship, and promote well-being at work and employee engagement.  As  a  result,  the  momentum  developed  since 2020,  through  the  launch  of  the  Baby  Leave  policy  and  the implementation  of  the  Inclusion  &  Diversity  (I&D)  strategy, continued during 2022.\n\nKering  places  the  employee  experience  at  the  heart  of  its Human  Resources  Strategy.  The  sections  of  this  chapter correspond to key milestones in the career of each employee.\n\n## A CULTURE OF SHARING\n\n<!-- image -->",

In most Houses, the HR function has begun discussions about managing jobs and careers through strategic workforce planning.\n\n## Forging strategic partnerships\n\nKering continues  its ambition  of  forging  international partnerships  with  prestigious  business  and  design  schools worldwide.\n\nKering  is  continuing  to  forge  closer  ties  with  the  Centre  for Sustainable  Fashion  (CSF)  at  the  London  College  of  Fashion (LCF)  through  the  Fashion  Values  program,  which  it  leads jointly with Vogue Business and Cond\u00e9 Nast. Launched in 2014 and  then  renewed  in  2019,  this  international  partnership allows Kering to affirm its commitment to the people who will make the fashion of the future and immerse them in the key themes of our time, i.e. nature, society, the economy and the environment.  The  12-month  program  is  open  to  students taking courses at the LCF but also to anyone whose work has a connection with fashion and design, and combines theoretical  learning  with  practice  through  a  hackathon, culminating  in  the  Fashion  Values  Challenge.  The  teaching offered as part of the program is set out in an annual report, which  changes  each  year  to  reflect  the  latest  advances  in sustainability within the fashion industry.\n\nKering and the LCF also launched the first Massive Open Online Course  (MOOC)  on  luxury  fashion  and  sustainability  in  2018. Entitled  'Fashion  &  Sustainability:  Understanding  Luxury Fashion in a Changing World', the six-week course combines films, podcasts, activities and discussions. More sessions will be held in 2023.\n\nFinally,  in  2022,  the  Sustainability  Chair  jointly  created  by Kering and Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode continued to expand its  scientific  research  on  a  wide  range  of  topics  related  to fashion  and  sustainability, from  traceability to impact assessment  to  eco-responsible  business  models.  For  the second  consecutive  year,  the  Chair  was  highly  active, publishing  a  research  article  on  emotional  sustainability published  in  the  Journal  of  Cleaner  Production,  as  well  as providing education in sustainability to more than 1,500 students via a compulsory 30-hour course. It continued to  deliver  the  diploma  course  created  in  2021,  combining 60  hours  of  lessons  (with  contributions  from  experts)  with practical  projects  in  an  educational  approach  that  combines theory and practice.\n\nRenewed in 2020, the Group's partnership with HEC allows it to  support  high-performing  young  people  from  a  variety  of backgrounds and to identify potential hires for the Group and its Houses. The Kering Certificate of Influential Luxury aims to help  future  leaders  learn  how  best  to  handle  luxury  brand management  challenges  through  Kering's  vision  and  values. A  team  challenge  on  a  topic  set  by  one  of  the  Houses  Boucheron in 2022 - culminates in a presentation to a panel consisting  of  the  Chair's  academic  co-directors  and  Kering managers. The theme in 2022 was 'How to give the watches market fresh impetus by taking a 360\u00b0 approach?'.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  support  numerous  institutions, building  on  the  close  relationships  developed  by  Kering's entire  HR  community  worldwide,  including  ESCP,  ESSEC,  EM Lyon, Institut  Fran\u00e7ais  de  la  Mode (IFM), Istituto  Marangoni , Politecnico  di  Milano ,  Bocconi  University,  Polimoda  Fashion School, Istituto Europeo di Design , Accademia Costume & Moda in  Rome,  Tsinghua  University  and  Hong  Kong  Polytechnic University.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  have  also  established  local  partnerships and developed craft training at centers of excellence in order to  ensure  the  promotion  and  protection  of  the  Group's expertise. These are presented in section 6.2.1.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also serves to create a fast-track development stream for talented individuals at an early stage of their careers, to build a pool of potential candidates for the Houses, and to develop the potential of apprentices. During this 21-month program, participants undertake a series of internships in different Houses to learn about the operation of Retail Management and HR. The program has been a big success, with more than 2,000 applications and 273 recruitment sessions - both online and in person - held in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. 21 interns were selected and began their training in mid-January 2022 with a 2-month intensive in-store placement. Recruitment has already begun for the 2023 cohort, which will begin the program in July 2023.\n\nThe need to cultivate talent in the constantly evolving supply chain and logistics areas led Kering to develop the Kering Horizon Program. Through experience in a variety of roles, mentoring, and intensive training modules, this two-year program seeks to accelerate the leadership potential of graduate engineers and prepare them for the supply chain and logistics roles of the future. The best candidates were recruited as full-time employees at Kering and began the program in December 2021.\n\nThe program is also supported by Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, and the nine engineers in this first cohort are currently gaining experience in different roles. In response to strong demand from its Houses, Kering has increased the number of places available, and is currently recruiting 14 young graduates for its second cohort.\n\n## Recruiting the best talents\n\nIn  addition  to  partnerships  with  schools  and  universities, Kering  uses  the  most  effective  social  media  platforms  and other  tools  to  recruit  the  best  profiles  available.  Kering's Houses  are  constantly  investing  in  order  to  offer  the  best possible  experience  to  applicants  through  innovative  and inclusive  solutions.  In  2020,  Gucci  launched  an  online assessment  process  that  uses  augmented  reality  to  give applicants experience while evaluating them for the essential skills required to be a sales associate in one of Gucci's many stores worldwide.\n\nThe Gucci Grade program includes experience working in a store and the possibility of gaining different skills by working in various Gucci departments (such as merchandizing, sales and customer service). In 2022, Gucci Grade was extended to cover the Supply Chain and Operations functions. This will enable five engineering graduates to gain skills in different areas of the company through two six-month postings.\n\n## KERING EYEWEAR EYE FOR TALENT\n\nIn 2022, Kering Eyewear launched its Eye for Talent graduate program. Over a two-year period, participants will have four six-month postings, each in a different country or market (Milan, Paris, Dubai and Aarhus). The application period ended in mid-December, and the selected candidates will begin the program in April 2023.\n\nA  training  program  on  inclusive  recruitment  was  introduced for  the  entire  Kering  group  in  2020,  to  help  recruiters  and managers identify common biases in the recruitment process and  minimize  their  impact.  The  program,  which  has  already been  taken  by  387  HR  employees,  covers  all  stages  in  the recruitment  process:  creation  of  the  vacancy,  applicant selection,  interview  and  the  new  hire's  integration  into  the company.  In  2022,  407  recruitment  managers  received training  in  inclusive  recruitment.  This  training  will  be  rolled out across as many recruitment managers as possible in 2023 through  an  e-learning  course.  In  addition,  the  Houses  have implemented  fully  fledged  inclusive  recruitment  strategies, such as Balenciaga's Hiring Pact, which takes a 360\u00b0 approach to  drive  real-world  progress  in  the  area  of  inclusion  and diversity.\n\n## Breakdown of fixed-term and permanent contracts among new hires in 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( % )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 13,375 people were hired on permanent contracts. Out of the total number of new hires, including people on fixed-term contracts and apprentices:\n\n- \u00b7 62.0% were women;\n- \u00b7 92.6% were non-managers;\n- \u00b7 27.9% came from Generation Z, 59.7% from Generation Y, 12.2% from Generation X and 0.2% were born before 1960.",

These  principles  were  applied strictly in relation to the  sale  of  Ulysse  Nardin  and Girard-Perregaux  (completed  on  May  31 st , 2022)  and  the integration of Lindberg (completed on September 30 th ,  2021) and Maui Jim (completed on October 3 rd , 2022).\n\nIn France, this policy involves monthly meetings of the Social Development  Coordination  group,  a  body  of  HR  managers from the Houses led by Kering's Human  Resources Department,  which  is  tasked  with  discussing  organizational projects and their HR consequences and proposing individual redeployment solutions. It aims to assist employees when an organizational change (such as a store transfer or closure) is liable to have an impact on jobs.\n\nIn all countries and for all Houses, when departures are being considered  following  reorganizations,  efforts  made  to  find new roles for employees go beyond those required by law, and priority is given to voluntary mobility measures.\n\nThe European Works Council is also informed of the Group's plans  and  the  associated  organizational  changes  during  its two  annual  plenary  meetings,  in  extraordinary  committee meetings  as  necessary,  and  in  the  meetings  of  its  Select Committee.  The  French  Works  Council  is  also  informed annually of the Group's plans for organizational change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is why Kering makes every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization and provides its teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and stimulating work environment,  thereby  contributing  to  the  Group's  success. Kering  pays  close  attention  to  diversity  in  employee  profiles (gender,  culture,  origin,  sexual  orientation,  identity,  age  and disability),  which  it  recognizes  as  a  rewarding  source  of collective intelligence.\n\nAs part of its 2025 Sustainability strategy, Kering is promoting diversity  and  gender  equality  through  a  series  of  concrete commitments, which include ensuring gender parity and pay equity at all levels.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Kering's  Executive  Management  and  European Works Council signed their first European Empowering Talent agreement.\n\nIn  2019,  Kering  announced  its  support  for  the  Standards  of Conduct  published  by  the  UN  to  help  businesses  tackle discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community. In September 2019, Kering joined the Open To All coalition, which combats all  forms  of  discrimination  against  employees,  visitors  and customers,  including  discrimination  based  on  ethnicity, nationality,  sex,  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  religion and disability.\n\nEach  House  set  up  an  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Committee  in 2020, sponsored by a member of its management team. These committees are made up of representatives from the various departments  and  regions.  Their  role  is  to  transpose  the Group's inclusion and diversity strategy within their respective Houses,  while  adapting  it  to  their  specific  cultures  and environments. The initiative is sponsored by Kering's Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  the  sponsor  of  the  Kering Corporate  Inclusion  and  Diversity  Committee  is  the  Group's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIn 2022, to make the numerous initiatives led by the Group, its regional entities and  its Houses  more  impactful  and complementary, Kering adopted an overall strategy supported by a new governance arrangement with a regional dimension, particularly in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. Kering recognizes that  each  country  and  each  culture  have  their  own  specific context, with unique challenges and opportunities for change. This  approach  provides  a  greater  understanding  of  local contexts  and  brings  external  perspectives,  with  the  aim  of embedding a culture of change across the Group.\n\nTo  give  its  initiatives  a  defined  structure,  Kering  adopted  six common areas of action for all of its Houses:\n\n- \u00b7 gender equality;\n- \u00b7 diversity in terms of cultural profiles and origins;\n- \u00b7 equal opportunities, regardless of socio-economic background;\n- \u00b7 equal  treatment  and  opportunities  regardless  of  gender identity and sexual orientation;\n- \u00b7 intergenerational diversity at work;\n- \u00b7 integration of disabled people at work.\n\nKering  regularly  raises  its  employees'  awareness  of  matters relating to inclusion and diversity. The theme of inclusion and diversity,  addressed  through  case  studies  on  gender  equality and  flexibility  at  work  and  on  intergenerational  differences, was  one  of  the  four  modules  in  the  Ethics  &  Compliance mandatory annual training program in 2022.\n\nOne of the highlights in terms of inclusion at Kering in 2022 was  the  Kering  Perspectives  training  seminar  for  all  Kering Executive  Committee  members  and  global  function  heads, which  focused  on  raising  awareness  of  how  human  bias operates  and  ways  of  mitigating  it,  thereby  promoting inclusive leadership.\n\nIn  March  2022,  alongside  31  other  companies,  the  Kering group signed a commitment to enhance the role of employees aged  50  and  over,  an  initiative  led  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  group  and Club  Landoy  and  sponsored  by  France's  Ministry  of  the Economy, Finance and Recovery. The charter features ten key commitments regarding recruitment, training, career progression, well-being at work and preparation for retirement,  but  also  awareness  of  age-related  stereotypes. By  developing  and  supporting  the  careers  of  our  employees aged 50 and over, the Kering group is encouraging the transfer of  know-how,  which  is  essential  in  our  industry,  from generation to generation.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Inclusion  and  Diversity  teams  reporting  to the  Group  HR  department,  Alexander  McQueen,  Balenciaga, Kering  Corporate,  Kering  Eyewear  and  Gucci  have  resources fully dedicated to the issue of inclusion and diversity.\n\nGucci has a full inclusion and diversity program, including (i) an  inclusion  and  diversity  development  program  for  all employees, (ii) a global design scholarship for talented young people  in  all  regions  of  the  world,  and  (iii)  an  in-house international  exchange  program.  Gucci  is  also  a  signatory  to the UN Charter on LGBTQI+ rights. Since 2019, Gucci has had a Global  Equity  Board  featuring  Gucci  managers  and  external experts, in order to define priorities and monitor progress in the  areas  of  diversity,  equality  and  inclusion,  in  line  with Kering's policies. It meets at least twice per year.\n\nSince  2020,  Balenciaga  has  been  implementing  an  inclusion and  diversity  program  that  includes:  (i)  an  inclusion  and diversity training course for all employees, including initiatives specifically  for  managers,  (ii)  funding  for  two  talented  young creatives that have had little exposure to major luxury Houses to undertake studio internships, (iii) a program to increase the employability of refugees in Italy, (iv) a partnership with nonprofit Share Africa to support African creativity.\n\n## 3.2.1.1 Establishing a culture of gender equality within the Group\n\nWhile Kering addresses the issue of diversity in all its aspects, particular emphasis is placed on equal opportunities. In 2010, the Group was one of the first companies in France to sign the Women's  Empowerment  Principles,  drafted  by  UN  Women and the United Nations Global Compact. These principles offer guidance on how to promote the presence and progression of women in business and, more generally, in society.",

Created  in  2010  by  Danone,  this  innovative  management program aims to  nurture  strong  and  inspiring  individuals,  in sufficient  numbers  to  enable  them  to  bring  about  corporate change.\n\nKering was one of the leading companies in the France 2022 gender equality index, with a consolidated score of 90 points out  of  100  for  all  of  its  Corporate  entities  and  Houses  in France. As part of its 2025 Sustainability Strategy, Kering has made a commitment to achieving  pay  equity  at  all  levels.  It has action plans to achieve its target of gender parity in 2025.\n\n## Recognizing and assessing the impact of gender equality initiatives\n\nIn 2022, women accounted for 56.9% of the Group's managers, 62.9% of the total workforce (63.2% in 2021, 63.1% in 2020), 26%  of  its  Tech  workforce,  33%  of  Executive  Committee members  and  45%  of  its  Directors  (excluding  Directors representing  employees),  making  Kering  one  of  the  CAC  40 companies  with  the  highest  proportion  of  women  in  senior management  positions.  The  Group  has  set  a  target  of achieving  a  gender  parity  and  pay  equity  at  all  levels  of  the organization by 2025.\n\nKering  rose  from  ninth  to  second  among  nearly  12,000 companies  from  around  the  world  in  Refinitiv's  Diversity  & Inclusion  Index  (2022),  and  intends  to  build  on  these  very encouraging  results,  which  show  its  commitment  and  the impact  of  its  practical  initiatives  to  build  an  increasingly representative and high-performing team.\n\nMore  broadly,  efforts  made  to  promote  female  talent  reflect how  committed  the  Group  is  to  women,  both  inside  and outside the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Through  the  Kering  Foundation,  which  combats  violence against  women  by  supporting  projects  led  by  NGOs  and social entrepreneurs  and  by  raising  awareness  and promoting involvement among the Group's employees. The Kering  Foundation  also  works  to  raise  awareness  among employees by including them in many of its projects, while Gucci  is  committed  to  combating  domestic  violence. Between 2013 and 2022, in  collaboration  with  the  Kering Foundation, training was provided to more than 450  employees.  In  addition,  on  International  Day  for the Elimination of Violence against Women (November 25, 2020), the Kering Foundation launched the 16 Days 16 Films campaign in the United Kingdom, France and  Italy,  in  partnership  with  Modern  Films  and  with  the participation of non-profit organizations En Avant Toute(s) , Chayn  Italia,  the  National  Network  to  End  Domestic Violence  (NNEDV), Fondo  Semilias and  the  UK  SAYS  NO MORE  campaign.  In  line  with  UN  Women's  16  Days  of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, 16 films directed by women were posted on social media between November 25  and  December  10.  The  campaign  reached  more  than 900,000 people in five countries via social and print media (see section 6.3.1);\n- \u00b7 The  Group  firmly  believes  that  businesses  have  a  decisive role  to  play  in  combating  violence  against  women.  In  line with  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  Convention 190  on  violence  and  harassment  in  the  workplace,  the Kering Foundation worked with the Group Human Resources Department in 2020 to draft a global policy on domestic  violence.  The  internal  program  developed  by  its teams  aims  to  provide  appropriate  support  for  survivors and victims of domestic violence and came into effect on January 1, 2021;\n- \u00b7 In  the  film  industry,  as  an  Official  Partner  of  the  Cannes Film Festival, Kering showcases and supports the contribution  of  women  to  the  film  industry,  both  behind and in front  of  the  camera,  through  its  Women  in  Motion initiative;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gucci  also  signed  the Women's  Forum  CEO Champions Commitments, which consist of ten recommendations for achieving gender equality.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Promoting the integration of people with disabilities\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Group  employed  644  workers with disabilities (coverage rate of 86.4% excluding the United Kingdom and the United States).\n\nKering reaffirmed its commitment to the integration of people with  disabilities  with  the  European  Empowering  Talent agreement signed in February 2015. This agreement reiterates and reinforces the commitments  made  to  employee representatives  in  2008  with  regard  to  promoting  the employment of people with disabilities.\n\nEach  year,  management  presents  a  progress  report  to  the European  Works  Council  on  the  agreement's  three  pillars, which  include  promoting  diversity  in  general,  and  on  the initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Houses  in  the  areas  of  gender equality and equal opportunity.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  in  France  and  Italy  also  continue  to outsource  work  to  the  protected  sector  to  promote  the employment  of  people  with  disabilities.  Special  service providers employing workers with disabilities are called on for such  services  as  printing,  data  entry,  archiving,  replying  to unsolicited job applications, catering, preparing mailshots, gift packaging during the holiday season, and landscaping.\n\nKering Corporate and the Houses also forge partnerships and deploy  awareness  campaigns  to  ensure  that  employees  are onboard with this strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Gucci became the first and only luxury brand in the United  States  to  be  certified  by  the  Disability  Equality Index.  This  certification  is  awarded  by  two  organizations that  protect  the  rights  of  disabled  people:  the  American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and Disability:IN,  a  global  network  that  works  to  integrate disabled  people  and  provides  support  to  more  than  400 companies. Gucci's index score was 80/100, making it one of the best places for disabled people to work in the United States.  Gucci  also  works  with  local  non-profits  to  recruit people with Down syndrome in one of its Italian factories;\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Kering Corporate offered employees two awareness-raising sessions: thanks to the DuoDay platform, a  number  of  people  with  disabilities  from  outside  the Group  took  part  in  a  'live-my-life'  day  with  Kering employees,  whilst  several  teams  participated  in  cookery workshops in which they experienced what life is like for a disabled person. These activities are a fun, interactive way to  raise  awareness  about  disability  diversity  and  the importance of fostering a culture of inclusion. As part of its inclusive  recruitment  efforts,  Kering  also  took  part  in several forums devoted to disabled people.\n\n## 3.2.1.3 Forging partnerships to facilitate the employment of young or disadvantaged people\n\nTo preserve and pass on their expertise, several of the Group's Houses - namely Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Brioni, Pomellato and Boucheron  -  have  created  vocational  schools  and  training programs, with the support of trade associations. The aim is to give  young  people  the  opportunity  to  learn  a  trade  that  will ultimately enable them to join one of the Group's Houses or find employment elsewhere in the luxury or fashion industries (see  section  6.2.1).  For  example,  of  the  12  apprentices  who took part in internships at Pomellato as part of the Accademia Pomellato  Virtuosi's  2022  cohort,  eight  have  moved  on  to highly  qualified  roles,  bolstering  the  House's  expertise  and helping the transfer of know-how to younger generations.\n\nKering is working with charities T\u00e9l\u00e9maque and Energie Jeunes to make concrete progress in terms of equal opportunities, by making it easier for all employees to volunteer during working hours (see Giving Back).\n\nIn  2022, Kering signed a charter for the integration of young people,  vulnerable  individuals  and  people  with  disabilities, with the aim of working with the French Ministry of Labor to support  them  in  the  job  market.  This  shows  the  Group's ongoing  commitment  to  addressing  this  challenge  in  our society.\n\nSince 2019, Balenciaga has partnered with non-profit ViensVoirMonTaf! which  works  to  combat  social  determinism and school dropout by helping high-school students in priority areas to find work experience placements. Each year, French high-school  students  discover  various  jobs  done  by  the House's employees through theme presentations and immersion within its departments.\n\n## 3.2.2 Development of talents and skills\n\nDeveloping  skills  and  talents  is  at  the  heart  of  Kering's  HR policy. In 2022, it strengthened the community and initiatives it launched in 2020, with three main aims:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the fundamentals of the internal mobility policy;\n- \u00b7 maintaining  training  despite  uncertainties  and  difficulties in bringing employees together;\n- \u00b7 increasing  the  use  of  our  internal  platform  to  support employee development.\n\n## 3.2.2.1 Managing and supporting talents, fostering mobility and professional development within the Group\n\nKering  has  set  itself  the  priority  of  better  identifying  and developing  talents  and  has  for  this  purpose  established processes  and  tools  geared  toward  helping  employees constantly expand their career prospects and strengthen their skills through mobility and career opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Developing a shared culture of performance\n\nTalent  and  leadership  potential  are  identified  through  the performance appraisal process and talent reviews.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  introduced  People  Performance  and Development  Annual  Review,  which  take  place  between employees and their managers, to assess performance relative to jointly set targets and the employee's development needs. These reviews, which took place between January and March 2022, strengthen the Group's dynamic approach to appraisals, combined with regular check-in conversations. Various guides and  materials  are  made  available  by  the  Houses  to  help employees and managers prepare for, conduct and follow up on reviews, and fill in the related form. Meanwhile, dedicated training  sessions  for  HR  teams  at  all  the  Houses  were delivered  by  the  Group.  At  the  end  of  the  campaign,  almost 10,000 people had completed the performance form.\n\nOnce talented individuals have been identified, the aim is to gain  a  clearer  picture  of  their  profile,  define  the  support initiatives needed  in  terms  of  organization  and  talent development, and prepare succession plans for key positions. In 2021, the process of identifying talent within the Group was expanded  to  include  more  roles  in  order  to  support  the creation  of  talent  development  plans  and  the  ability  to anticipate the organization's needs. In 2022, Kering continued its efforts to include more functions, and this helped identify talent in the retail business in particular. A gender analysis is always included in the talent review and succession planning processes.\n\n## 2. Promoting mobility and careers within the Group and its Houses\n\nProfessional mobility is a pivotal way of developing skills, offer careering  prospects  and  giving  everyone  the  opportunity  to grow within the Group.\n\nthat  there  should  be  greater  transparency  on  available  roles, giving  employees  greater  control  over  their  careers  and supporting  internal  applications  in  order  to  enhance  the culture of professional development within the Group.\n\nEmployees can now apply for a position  after  18  months  of service. They can also register as internal candidates and have confidential  contact  with  internal  recruiters  before  applying. Meetings  of  the  HR  community  were  organized  to  facilitate ongoing dialogue on recruitment needs and available people, in  addition  to  dedicated  training  and  tools  for  the  whole community. The introduction of this new policy was backed by a  communication  campaign.  In  2022,  more  than  3,700 employees expressed their wish to move to a new role within the Group. During the same period of time, there were more than 2,700 internal mobilities.\n\n## 3.2.2.2 Developing a structured training policy for all employees\n\nIn 2022, Kering devoted a budget of more than \u20ac36 million to employee training, corresponding to 1.27% of the total Group payroll. As a result, 606,444 hours of training (excluding safety training) were provided during the year, an increase of 5% on 2021; 47,502 employees (including leavers) took at least one training course.\n\nWomen accounted for 62.8% of the people who participated in training  in  2022  (excluding  safety  training).  Furthermore, 83.2% of employees who participated in training in 2022 were non-managers.\n\nIn  light  of  the  Houses'  new  operations  and  Kering's  new projects,  the  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  people participating  in  training  and  the  number  of  training  hours illustrates the Group's desire to give employees development opportunities and assist new employees.\n\nA review was started in 2021 with all Houses to define a new basis for easier internal mobility. As the shared objective is to increase the number of internal opportunities, it was agreed\n\nBreakdown of employees who received training by manager/non-manager and by gender in 2022, 2021 and 2020 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Personalizing our employees' digital experience to give them agency over their own development\n\nA new digital platform intended for employees working at the Group's  various  head  offices,  was  launched  in  2022  after  a pilot carried out at Gucci in 2021 called Gucci Education. The platform  offers  a  new  catalog  of  open-source  content  and customized pathways based on each user's functional profile and  skills.  It  offers  more  than  350  programs  across  23 disciplines, allowing employees to identify the skills they need for  their  professional  development  and  empowers  them  in their  learning  journey.  A  new  catalog  was  introduced  in October 2022 and the results for the first three months were encouraging,  with  more  than  2,300  employees  receiving training on the platform.\n\nKering Learning is the common thread that runs through the Group's  training  opportunities.  It  is  a  collaborative  tool between  the  Group,  its  Houses  and  its  regions,  which  can customize and enhance their interfaces with specific content. As an extension of this general offering, Kering is preparing to hold its first Global Learning Day in 2023, a new training event that will offer exclusive content, both remotely and in person, for all employees all over the world.\n\nIn 2022,  Kering  Learning  reached  more  than  96%  of employees, with 39,860 users taking more than 55,000 hours of training (more than 100,000 sign-ups for catalog content).\n\n## 2. Developing and maintaining regional training opportunities for managers and employees from all Group Houses\n\nKering  also  rolled  out  its  managerial  training  pathway, including support  for  managers  at  each  stage:  initial experience,  co-development  courses  with  their  peers  and finally support from senior managers. In addition, employees were able to sign up for online workshops on themes such as hybrid  working,  how  to  increase  your  impact,  finding  your strengths and how to gain a more balanced career.\n\nOverall, in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 in Europe, 300 managers took part in the training pathway, with two thirds attending in person (180);\n- \u00b7 in  Asia,  35  virtual  programs  were  offered,  which  made  it possible to provide training to 660 employees;\n- \u00b7 in the Americas, nine programs (18 sessions) were offered, allowing the Group to train 175 employees.\n\nKering  has  also  developed  its  training  offering  by  creating functional  Academies.  These  were  designed  jointly  with  the Houses,  and  aim  to  give  employees  in-depth  knowledge relevant to their functions: human  resources,  finance, sustainability, technology, merchandizing, etc.\n\nEach Academy offers employees specialist training to improve their  technical  skills,  as  well  as  enabling  them  to  form communities  and  helping  them  to  anticipate  their  future needs. For example, the Human Resources Academy provided training  to  550  employees  and  offered  new  formats  such  as onboarding  sessions  for  all  new  employees  joining  the  HR function,  small-group  discussions  with  the  Houses'  HR managers  (four  sessions  in  2022)  and  inspiration  sessions with external speakers, which attracted over 100 participants.\n\n## 3. Digitalization of programs dedicated to the Group's talents\n\nThe digitalization of HR tools has enabled the Group to achieve a huge expansion in the training it offers to its talents, both inperson and remotely.\n\n## Kering Leadership\n\nIn-person training was possible again in 2022, so Kering was able  to  hold  its  Kering  Leadership  Program  in  Paris,  New York and Seoul.\n\nComposed of three four-day modules held over 12 months, the  2022  program  was  attended  by  around  30  top  Kering managers.\n\nIts  aim  is  to  nurture  talented  employees and develop their leadership  capabilities.  The  2022  cohort  consisted  of participants  from  the  three  regions  and  from  ten  different Houses and Group entities.\n\n## Kering Vision\n\nIn  2022,  the  Kering  Vision  program,  jointly  designed  with Kering Imagination Lab ,  took place in the form of a web 3.0 hackathon.\n\nFor  three  days,  more  than  70  employees  from  different professional  backgrounds  met  in  Paris,  built  teams  and exchanged ideas to imagine and forge the future of luxury. At the end of the program, they presented their projects to a jury of senior executives from Kering and its Houses.\n\n## Kering Navigate\n\nThe  Group  implemented  an  international,  100%  virtual program called Kering Navigate. Targeting the Group's young leaders,  the  program  brought together 51 people from the Group's various businesses, covering 10 different nationalities. It gave participants the opportunity to reflect on how to deal with complexity and find resources to manage the crisis and the  associated  changes  in  work  practices  as  effectively  as possible.  Participants  benefited,  over  a  six-month  period, from  internal  conferences,  training  with  external  service providers,  participation  in  working  groups  and  individual support.\n\n## Kering Mentoring\n\nIn  late  2021,  Kering  rolled  out  its  mentoring  program, designed to develop talent by drawing on the experience of senior  managers  and  providing  the  opportunity  to  share  a common  experience  within  the  Group.  This  Group-level program is now being rolled out locally  across  the  various regions.  In  Europe,  50  people,  or  25  mentor-mentee pairings,  from  ten  different  Houses  and  four  different countries  (France,  Italy,  the  United  Arab  Emirates  and  the United  Kingdom)  came  together  to  start  a  six-month development program. In Asia, 30 people from ten different Houses  took  part  in  the  program  and  the  first  American cohort will join in 2023.",

Over  the  years, Kering  has  fostered  employee  engagement  through  shared experiences,  helped  to  create  a  common  culture,  and strengthened the feeling of belonging to an integrated Luxury Group.\n\nThrough our internal platforms, everyone at Kering now has a voice and can access Group information at any time, via any channel.\n\nTo  foster  a  culture  of  dialogue,  Kering  has  since  2020  held discussions  with  employees  that  are  livestreamed  on  the Group's  social  media  platforms,  for  the  benefit  of  all employees  worldwide.  In  these  discussions,  Kering  leaders such as Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, along with external speakers who are experts on the company's key issues,  answer  employee  questions  directly.  The  videos  are then  available  for  replay.  Since  these  discussions  were launched,  employees  have  been  increasingly  engaging  with them  in  terms  of  comments  and  reactions.  In  2022,  Kering produced 15 livestreams on topics as varied as the employee share ownership plan, financial results, and successes in the digital domain.\n\n## Global communication campaigns about the Group's values and policies\n\nThe internal communication campaigns conducted by Kering strengthen  the  Group's  shared  history  and  vocabulary  and enable  the  deployment  of  new  HR  resources  and  policies centered around the Group's shared values:\n\n- \u00b7 For the seventh consecutive year, a five-week communication  campaign  was  conducted  via  the  Group's two  internal  networks  to  inform  all  employees  about Kering's culture of integrity and the ethics and compliance principles  applicable  across  the  Group.  This  campaign accompanied  the  online  'Ethics  and  Compliance'  training course, which is mandatory for all employees in all Houses and  in  2022  focused  on  four  themes:  human  rights, corruption, sustainability and well-being at work. The 2022 uptake rate of 96.5% reflects the commitment of all Group employees to this subject.\n- \u00b7 For the third consecutive year, all employees were required to take a Privacy & Cybersecurity e-learning module, which had  two  options:  one  for  customer-facing  teams  and another for employees who do not work in retail. In 2022, the module saw an excellent uptake rate of 92.6%.\n\nInternal  mobility  is  key  in  ensuring  the  retention  of  talent. This is why, once again in 2022, the Group held a promotional campaign  among  all  employees,  in  order  to  emphasize  the benefits  for  all  stakeholders.  The  campaign  took  place  on Kering's social media  platforms,  featuring  stories  from employees  who  have  successfully  changed  roles  within  the Group,  moving  between  Houses,  functions  or  countries. This program forms part of the same process as Gucci's 'Gucci Changemakers'  volunteer  program,  created  in  2019  to encourage  all  Gucci  employees  to  support  their  local communities. The program allows employees to spend up to four days of their working time helping non-profit organizations  in  four  key  areas:  the  environment,  education,\n\nsocial justice, and  health  and  well-being. More  than 2,400  applications  to  take  part  were  received  and  200 activities  were  identified,  with  more  than  1,750  employees worldwide becoming involved through over 100 collaborations with non-profits.\n\nGiven the nature of its businesses and its Houses' client base, combating  violence  against  women  is  a  key  issue  for  the Group,  which  has  been  committed  to  this  cause  since  2008 through the Kering Foundation. Since 2011, 1,912 employees, including  the  Group  Executive  Committee,  have  received training  to  help  them  understand  the  impact  of  domestic violence  and  promote  a  supportive  work  environment  for women  who  are  victims  of  domestic  violence.  The  Kering Foundation  has  also  developed  a  30-minute  e-learning session, available in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German and  Dutch.  The  Kering  Foundation  also  encourages  Group employees to use both their professional and personal skills to  support  partner  NGOs  and  social  enterprises.  Since  2021, eight of the Foundation's non-profit partners offered assignments on the Giving Back platform, which allows Group employees  in  France,  Italy  and  the  UK  to  spend  up  to 21 working hours per year on volunteering projects.\n\nIn 2022, to develop a culture of feedback in which employees' ideas lead to practical action and in which managers can drive change around them, Gucci carried out three opinion surveys in which 3,000 employees took part, with an average response rate  of  62%,  along  with  a  survey  of  all  Gucci  employees worldwide  (almost  19,000  people)  with  a  response  rate  of 83%.\n\n## 3.2.4 Quality of life at work\n\nAs early as 2010, Kering signed a 'Charter of commitments on the quality of life at work and the prevention of work-related stress' with the Group's European Works Council. This charter has  enabled  the  Houses  to  develop  and  implement  action plans based on three key principles:\n\n- 1. identifying  and  assessing  the  causes  of  stress  in  the workplace;\n- 2. deploying  preventive  measures  to  improve  quality  of life at work and reduce workplace stress factors;\n- 3. keeping  employees  informed  and  giving  them  the opportunity  to  provide  anonymous  feedback  so  that the Houses' action plans can be adjusted or enhanced.\n\nSince 2015, health, safety and quality of life at work have been the key aspects of Kering's commitments under the European agreement  signed  with  the  European  Works  Council  on February  19,  2015.  Under  that  agreement,  the  Houses  are adopting  procedures  and  taking  action  to  identify,  assess, reduce  and  prevent  the  key  risks  associated  with  their activities. They are also taking initiatives designed to achieve continuous  improvements  in  quality  of  life  at  work.  In  this way, Kering is committed to developing a working environment and working relationships that ensure well-being at  work,  to  promote  the  development  of  all  employees  and contribute to the Group's performance.\n\nThe  most  recent  Kering  People  Survey  #Nofilter  in  2021 included  questions  on  quality  of  life  at  work,  morale,  stress, work-life  balance,  health  and  safety  and  mental  health.  This survey is an opportunity to listen to employees, analyze their responses and prepare action plans, particularly as regards the prevention of psychosocial risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  guide informs  employees about matters relating to  their  quality of life at work, the definition of psychosocial risks and the six factors that can influence employees' health, performance and satisfaction at work based on studies by the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  and  the  World Health Organization (WHO). It provides information on risk situations  and  offers  techniques  and  advice  to  help employees  and  managers  prevent  psychosocial  risks. The  guide  also  provides  a  reminder  of  the  Group's commitments, the related e-learning offering and dedicated contact people for all teams;\n- \u00b7 by developing in-person training for senior and less senior managers to help them detect situations where there is a lack  of  well-being,  hold  pre-emptive  conversations  with employees,  and  understand  what  their  roles  are  as managers and who they can ask for support both within the Group  and  externally,  to  create  a  safe  and  supportive working environment.\n\nMembers  of  Kering's  European  Works  Committee  also  took part  in  a  consultation  on  employee-management  dialogue and  well-being  at  work  within  the  Group,  and  a  common declaration was signed in the Committee's plenary meeting of December 1, 2022. In particular, this declaration refers to the Group's innovative policies to foster well-being at work: baby leave, its global policy on domestic violence and its policy on human rights, including upholding these rights in the working environment (see above section 3.4.2.1).\n\n## 3.2.4.1 Promotion of workplace safety and management of psychosocial risks\n\nIn  2020  and  2021  -  two  years  that  were  dominated  by  the COVID-19  pandemic  -  management  structures  within  each House  and  country  organization  ensured  that  health  and safety  measures  were  implemented  at  all  levels  worldwide. National, regional and local procedures were developed by the entities to put into practice Kering's global health and safety policies. A continuous consultation process was initiated with employees  on  the  topics  of  health,  safety  and  well-being  to enable  everyone  at  Kering  to  play  a  role  in  prevention  and protection measures. Employee-support resources were made available (including 24-hour hotlines in China and France, and custom support in Japan), backed up by innovative applications  (such  as  Joyable  in  the  United  States).  Pilot well-being  at  work  programs  were  launched,  including #takecare (guide, training, etc.) at Kering Corporate and Be well at Alexander McQueen.\n\nKering  made  all  of  its  HR  platforms  available  to  maintain constant  ties  with  employees,  regardless  of  the  health situation in their country of location.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  and  its  Houses  implemented  numerous protective  measures  at  Group  sites  worldwide  to  ensure  the health  and  safety  of  employees  and  clients,  in  line  with  the government's  recommendations  in  each  country  and  any changes  to  such  recommendations,  and  in  accordance  with the Group's global health and safety policy.\n\nIn  2022,  252  lost-time  accidents  were  recorded  across  all  of the  Group's  Houses,  compared  with  233  in  2021,  with  zero fatal accidents in 2022 as in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Frequency and severity rate of accidents in 2022, 2021 and 2020\n\n|                                                                                          |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Frequency of work-related accidents (number of accidents per  million hours worked)      |   3.36 |   3.46 |   3.5  |\n| Severity rate of work-related accidents (number of days lost per  thousand hours worked) |   0.09 |   0.1  |   0.09 |\n\nAcross  all  of  the  Group's  Houses,  25  employees  were recognized as suffering from a work-related illness in 2022.\n\nKering's  global  health  and  safety  policy  is  based  on  best practice from across the organization. It aims to ensure that a clear governance structure is in place and that regular internal\n\naudits and other processes are implemented Group-wide, with a view to achieving the zero-accident target each year. It also requires  the  Houses  to  take  specific  measures  to  improve quality  of  life  at  work  for  retail  employees  and  to  conduct regular health and safety audits.\n\n## Employee profiles ( % ) as of December 31, 2022 by area of activity (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Sales:  employees  working  in  wholesale,  stores  and  e-commerce. Production: employees working in production (workshops, tanneries, etc.). Other  areas:  employees  working  in  support  or  logistics functions.\n\nHealth and safety is a priority for the Group. Its global health and  safety  policy  sets  out  its  key  principles  in  this  area. The  Houses  adapt  their  local  procedures  by  involving  the Social  and  Economic  Committee's  Health,  Safety  &  Working Conditions  team,  ergonomists,  occupational  physicians  and external  prevention  specialists.  In  terms  of  risk  prevention, 41,023 hours of safety training were provided to 5,993 Group employees in 2022.",

The  overall  absenteeism  rate  includes absenteeism  due  to  illness  and  every  other  kind  of  absence (maternity  leave,  paternity  leave,  unjustified  absences,  etc.), calculated from the first day of absence.\n\nKering also works to prevent psychosocial risks and offers its employees  psychological  support.  In  Europe,  a  toll-free number  is  available  to  all  employees  who  feel  that  they require  psychological  support,  regardless  of  the  reason. Support  is  also  provided  when  employees  are  collectively affected by a particular event or situation.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  initiatives,  the  Houses  explore  various other avenues, including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  psychosocial  risk  factors  at  work  (e.g.,  Kering Corporate,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci  through  SA8000  and ISO 45001 (formerly OHSAS 18001) certification);\n- \u00b7 preventing  psychosocial  risks  and  stress  by  bringing  in healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists, osteopaths, sophrologists and teachers of yoga, Pilates, and meditation, particularly  at  Kering's  head  office,  and  providing  social assistance  services  for  employees.  Audits  were  conducted in  2019 for Kering Italia and Gucci to identify strengths in this area and avenues for improvement;\n- \u00b7 promoting  work-life  balance  (smart  working,  extension  of the remote working program, flextime, etc.) and introducing the  right  to  disconnect  in  France.  A  disconnection  charter and a guide to best practice regarding remote working also form part of the Group's work-related standards.\n\n## 3.2.4.2 Organization of work\n\nKering  strives  to  implement  an  organized  and  collective structure,  as  well  as  methods  and  know-how  that  allow employees to work together in the interest of the Group and based on set objectives.\n\nThe average working time of the Group's full-time employees is 40 hours per week. In 2022, 58,698 hours of overtime were logged in France, an increase on 2021.\n\nIn 2022, 2,068 employees worked part-time. Employees working part-time accounted for 4.7% of permanent employees, down from the previous year, and were located mainly in the United States  and  Western  Europe.  Contractual  working  hours  are spread  out  on  the  basis  of  the  specific  business  and organization  of  each  House,  either  over  certain  days  of  the week, or over reduced time slots on all working days.\n\nThe organization of working time remains a topic addressed by the Group's Houses and varies according to the countries, sites  and  employees  concerned  (in  stores,  production  and workshops  or  support  functions).  Kering  Corporate  and  the Houses make every effort to organize the work of employees in strict compliance with local health, safety and environment guidelines, including those relating to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn  France,  work  is  mostly  organized  on  the  basis  of  a  fixed number of hours or days, with annualized working time and the possibility of flextime.\n\nBeyond these legal aspects, the Houses try to find and offer more flexible ways to organize working time in order to meet their own needs as well as those of their employees as part of their  policy  on  quality  of  life  at  work:  flextime  for  several Houses, the introduction of a smart working pilot plan at the Bottega Veneta and Gucci headquarters in Italy, leave to care for sick  children  at  Boucheron  and  part-time  work  at Pomellato.  In  2022,  when  fitting  out  offices,  Kering  also included flex  office  arrangements  for  its  Corporate  functions and for its Houses in Europe which, alongside remote working, foster a better work/life balance.\n\nThese  discussions  are  regularly  shared  within  the  European Works  Council  and  discussions  are  also  held  with  managers and  employee  representatives  at  the  local  level  to  find  the most  appropriate  solutions  while  also  ensuring  employee well-being and a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## Promoting a better work-life balance and fostering well-being at work\n\nThe Group and its Houses are implementing actions in favor of work-life  balance,  benefiting  both  men  and  women  and based around three aspects.\n\n## 1) Operating a strong parental policy\n\nThe best example of Kering's commitment to work-life balance and  its  respect  for  working  parents  is  its  global  parental policy, deployed in 60 host countries on January 1, 2017 and further  enhanced  by  the  introduction  of  Baby  Leave  on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe  policy  aims  to  promote  a  better  balance  between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to  achieve equality  between  female  and  male  employees,  regardless  of their personal circumstances, guaranteeing all Group employees  worldwide  the  same  minimum  benefits  on  the arrival of a child, namely 14 weeks' paid leave.\n\nThe Group's Houses and Kering Corporate are also implementing initiatives  in  this  regard:  to  facilitate  their  return  to  work, Kering  Corporate  France  allows  new  parents  to  opt  for  parttime work at 80% of standard working hours without any loss of pay during the month following their return from maternity, paternity or adoption leave. Balenciaga's Baby Leave Comeback program has been in place since 2020 to make it easier  for  parents  to  come  back  to  work  by  offering  greater flexibility,  while  Gucci,  Pomellato,  Kering  UK  and  Kering  Italia all offer specific employee benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 2) Encouraging, where possible, more flexible work methods that enable employees to better organize their lives\n\nFlexible work was suggested by Kering employees as a way of improving  quality  of  life  at  work  and  enhancing  work-life balance, in response to the open-ended question included in the employee opinion surveys conducted in 2019 and 2021 in all  host  countries.  The  measures  deployed  by  the  Group  and its Houses as part of their action plans address this desire for more flexible work methods.\n\nThe deployment of company-wide platforms for HR, information,  communication,  training  and  dialogue  has  also contributed  to  improving  quality  of  life  at  work.  All  Group employees now have access to the same resources, regardless of  their  location,  profession  or  position,  representing  a  key factor in employee well-being.\n\nThe  Houses  have  also  been  able  to  capitalize  on  measures relating  to  well-being  at  work,  such  as  the  organization  of workplaces  in  line  with  the  highest  standards,  as  well  as flexible working hours, work-life balance and health and wellbeing.\n\nThe  accelerated  deployment  of  these  new  practices  in  2021 was supported by all teams, particularly the HR, IT and Security teams, and was facilitated by the digitalization of the Group's communication  platforms,  to  maintain  the  performance, engagement and well-being of employees.\n\n## 3) Creating a working environment in which work-life balance is both an objective and a reality\n\nKering  receives  recognition  for  these  initiatives,  and  the Group's participation in external networks serves to promote its developments in this area and help it continue to come up with  innovative  approaches.  Kering  has  been  a  member, since  2016,  of  a  discussion  platform  initiated  by  the International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  known  as  the  Global Business  Network,  the  French-speaking  branch  of  which brings together French-speaking companies that are committed to developing joint international welfare programs.\n\nKering  continues  to  contribute  to  the  work  of  the  Frenchspeaking ILO network and has been involved in the production of  three  best  practice  guides.  The  most  recent  of  these, 'Adopting  a  strategy  of  parental  support  and  measuring  its impact' was published in 2021. Another guide on well-being at work is currently being drafted.\n\n## 3.3 Remuneration and employee benefits\n\nThe Group's personnel expenses totaled around \u20ac2.8 billion in 2022 (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Chapter 6 of this document).\n\n## 3.3.1 Remuneration policy\n\nRemuneration is a key component that managers can use to reward  the  commitment  and  the  individual  and  collective performance  of  their  teams.  The  various  components  of  the pay  structure  and  the  way  they  are  managed  are  based  on principles defined by the Group.\n\n## Performance-related remuneration\n\nThere must be a strong link between remuneration, individual contribution  and  collective  performance.  This  link  with performance must exist for all components of remuneration, both  basic  salary  and  variable  elements  (i.e.  bonuses  and long-term incentives).\n\nAccordingly,  90%  of  the  Group's  employees  receive  a  fixed salary  and  a  variable  pay  component  that  is  subject  to  the achievement of individual and/or collective objectives.\n\nThe  individual  portion  of  variable  pay  is  determined  and managed  as  part  of  the  performance  management  process. Each employee's contribution to their team's results is assessed by  their  direct  manager  in  accordance  with  the  achievement of targets set and their behavior throughout the year.\n\nIn a similar spirit of recognizing and rewarding team performance and the contribution of all employees to Kering's growth and success,  the  Group  introduces  incentive  plans  in  countries where  this  is  encouraged  by  the  local  legislation.  In  France, nearly all employees benefit from a profit-sharing mechanism.\n\n## Competitive and fair remuneration\n\nMajor efforts are made to ensure that fixed salaries are both fair  internally  and  competitive  within  the  market.  They  are reviewed  annually,  based  on  proposals  made  by  direct managers. Fixed salary raises are granted in accordance with the level of the existing salary in comparison with peers and/ or the external market, factoring in performance over time and the potential for development.\n\nThe existence of a framework for all jobs within the Group and shared  by  all  Houses  (known  as  the  'Job  Catalogue')  enables their  accurate  definition  based  on  both  area  of  expertise  and level  of  responsibility.  This  is  particularly  helpful  during  the internal and  external  competitiveness  analyses  that  are regularly conducted by the Group, and for the fair allocation of variable pay and certain benefits in kind.\n\nIndividual  career  paths  within  the  Group  and  impacts  on individual  remuneration  are  managed  without  consideration of gender or age.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, the Group developed the Kering Parity Index, to allow Houses to evaluate and monitor their parity performance over time.  This  index  consists  of  four  individually  weighted indicators: parity indicator in the 300 executive positions with the greatest level of responsibility, gender pay gap by level of responsibility, comparative opportunities for men and women to  benefit  from  a  promotion  or  job  development,  and comparative  opportunities  for  men  and  women  to  receive  a pay rise. It will be calculated annually for each House and at the  consolidated  Group  level  in  order  to  identify  areas  of weakness requiring  specific  remedial  measures  and  to  allow changes in these various metrics to be monitored over time.\n\nTo support women and achieve pay equity by 2025, Gucci has analyzed salaries in more than 45 countries and prepared an initial report on the gender pay gap. In 2021, Gucci undertook to  carry  out  an  in-depth  analysis  of  salaries  paid  to  its workforce  in  Italy,  focusing  on  corporate,  retail  and  factory employees. A report on pay inequality is planned, which will make it easier to identify ways to promote gender equality and promote  an  inclusive  culture.  In  2021,  to  strengthen  its commitment to gender equality further, Gucci signed the CEO Champions Commitments during the G20 Women's Forum in Milan. In 2022, Gucci started the certification process, with the aim of obtaining Gender Parity certification for Italy in 2023.\n\n## Remuneration and social commitment\n\nUpstream  of  the  principles  of  fairness  and  competitiveness adopted  and  applied  by  Kering,  the  Group  has  a  strong commitment to guaranteeing a decent standard of living for each employee and their family.\n\nIn 2021, Kering carried out a global study to define, for each of the countries in which it operates, the Kering standards that would ensure a decent standard of living to all employees and their  families.  The  definition  of  a  decent  standard  of  living includes:  food,  water,  housing,  education,  healthcare  and other essentials needs.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  these  thresholds  are  reliable  and legitimate,  the  Group  has  drawn  on  the  Fair  Wage  Network methodology,  which  collects  and  analyzes  information  for different countries on a standardized basis. New research that becomes available in each country is systematically integrated by the organization. Thus, this committed approach will help Kering  fine-tune  and  strengthen  its  commitment  over  the years.\n\nEach House is informed of any shortfalls on an annual basis.\n\nThese initiatives are an integral part of the plan of action to achieve  gender  parity,  which  forms  part  of  the  2025 Sustainability Strategy.\n\n## Focus on: KeringForYou , Kering's first employee share ownership plan\n\nTo ensure that the value and wealth that Kering creates is shared fairly, it launched its first employee share ownership plan in 2022. Its name - KeringForYou - was chosen to convey the fact that it is designed to reflect the Group's employees, to recognize their qualities and commitment. The program was offered to Group employees based in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and South Korea, representing 80% of Kering's total workforce. The average take-up rate was 31%, and an impressive 66% in France. The initiative was recognized by the French federation of employee-shareholder and former employee associations (FAS), which named Kering the winner of its grand prize in the CAC All Tradable category. FAS said that Kering is a 'trailblazer in terms of employee share ownership in the luxury sector, with the aim of sharing and creating wealth and of strengthening the Group's employer brand'.\n\n## 3.3.2 Executive pay\n\nWithin Kering's senior management, the remuneration of 300 people  in  particular  is  monitored  by  the  Group's  Human resources  department,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  internal consistency and competitiveness in light of industry practice.\n\nThe  remuneration  structure  for  senior  executives  (portions allocated  as  base  pay  and  as  short-and  long-term  variable remuneration) is defined by the Group. It varies in accordance with the level of responsibility assigned  to  the  role. The  short-term  variable  remuneration  (annual  bonus)  policy aims to reward senior executives for meeting objectives - in part  financial  and  in  part  individual  -  set  in  line  with  the strategy of the Group and the Houses. Financial performance is  assessed  on  the  basis  of  two  indicators,  dedicated  to measuring  profitability  (recurring  operating  income)  and assessing the quality of the free cash flow of the Group and the Houses. The long-term incentive policy, meanwhile, meets two  objectives:  rewarding  executive  teams  for  both  their performance over time and their loyalty to the Group.\n\nSince 2020, all executives have had performance shares, which now  represent  the  main  element  of  Kering's  long-term incentive  schemes.  The  number  of  shares  granted  to  each executive varies with their level of responsibility. The number of shares delivered at the end of the vesting period may vary\n\nbetween  +/-  50%  compared  to  the  number  initially  granted, depending on Kering's share price performance compared to a panel of luxury industry stocks.\n\nFor  executives  working  within  a  Group  House,  the  Kering performance  shares  are  accompanied  by  monetary  units  in the same proportion, linked to the valuation of the House for which they work. These monetary units were launched in 2013 and their unit value evolves over time in line with the increase in the House's value. At the end of a three-year vesting period starting from the year that the monetary units were granted, executives  have  the  opportunity  to  exchange  their  monetary units  during  two  cash-in  windows  per  year  over  each  of  the subsequent two years.\n\n## 3.3.3 Employee benefits within the Group\n\nIn  addition  to  monetary  remuneration,  the  Kering  group  has always  placed  great  importance  on  offering  its  employees healthcare,  disability/life  cover  and  pension  benefits,  as  well as ensuring their well-being more generally. In addition to the coverage  provided  for  by  law,  almost  all  employees  enjoy supplementary  insurance  through  the  various  plans  in operation in the Group's Houses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  popular  plans  are  constantly  changing  to  better  meet employees'  expectations.  France  is  a  good  example  of  this: savings, pensions, healthcare and benefits were fully overhauled  in  2022  to  offer  employees  more  suitable coverage.  As  well  as  basic  coverage,  plans  often  include benefits  relating  to  well-being,  sports,  education,  recreation, transportation  and  family  support.  As  far  as  possible,  these benefits are available flexibly and can be selected to meet the needs  of  each  individual.  This  was  the  guiding  spirit  behind the  introduction  in  2020  of  the  ambitious  Flex  Benefits program for Gucci's employees in China.\n\n## 3.4 Social dialogue\n\nThe  Kering  group  strives  to  ensure  ongoing  employeemanagement dialogue specific to each of its bodies.\n\nIn 2021, European Works Council members had their terms of office  renewed,  and  the  EWC  marked  its  20th  anniversary. Members of the French Works Council appointed in 2019 also underwent  economic  and  workforce-related  training.  This training  took  place  in-person  in  Paris  and  fed  through  into Kering's employee-management dialogue at a national level.\n\nDespite  the  health  crisis,  the  two  plenary  sessions  of  the European  Works  Council  and  the  annual  meeting  of  the French  Works  Council  were  held  in  2020,  either  totally  or partially  in-person  with  all  of  the  necessary  protective measures. In addition to scheduled meetings, regular updates were organized with the offices of the Group's two employee representative bodies, throughout 2020 and 2021, to discuss such issues as the COVID-19 situation and the measures taken to protect the health and safety of employees.\n\n## 3.4.1 Listening to and engaging with employees\n\nBy  promoting  free  expression  within  the  Group  and  ongoing dialogue with employee representatives, Kering has long made clear  its  determination  to  forge  sustainable  and  constructive relationships with all its employees and their representatives.\n\nEach House adopts these commitments and Kering's policies. The Group's innovative employment policies cover 100% of its employees,  notably  through  the  provision  of  14-week  paid Baby  Leave,  preventative  measures  in  health  and  safety  and arrangements to safeguard human rights.\n\nIn  2022,  employee-management  dialogue  provided  a  key opportunity to discuss health and workforce-related developments  in  France,  Europe  and  worldwide.  Scheduled meetings and preparatory meetings continued, with the help of  an  expert,  ensuring  the  ongoing  success  of  the  Group's employee representative bodies and its employeemanagement dialogue process.\n\nEmployee-management dialogue was also enhanced by direct messages to employees from Group and House executives via Workplace,  the  corporate  social  network  accessible  to  all employees, regardless of the local health situation. Communication  with  employees  was  constant,  candid  and open  to  comments.  The  number  of  informal  meetings between the secretariats of the European Works Council and the Group's French Works Council increased in 2021.\n\nKering  promotes  its  employees'  work-life  balance,  which  is closely  associated  with  well-being.  The  Group  offers  flexible, hybrid  working,  which  has  now  been  adopted  by  most employees  in  Kering's  offices.  All  employees  receive  a minimum of two weeks of paid leave per year, notably in Asia and  the  USA,  where  paid  leave  is  not  covered  by  local  labor law. The paid leave policy allows employees to \"recharge their batteries'  so  as  to  better  engage  with  and  contribute  to  a positive and balanced work environment.\n\nThe number of working hours of industrial action fell to 1,021 in  2022,  compared  with  1,673  in  2021  and  150  in  2020,  in light of a recovery in global activity and solidarity movements in support of external causes.\n\n## 3.4.2 The Group's forums for employeemanagement dialogue\n\n## 3.4.2.1 The Kering European Works Council\n\nCreated  pursuant  to  the  agreement  of  September  27,  2000, the Kering European Works Council (EWC) provides a Europewide  forum  for  information,  consultation,  the  exchange  of views  and  dialogue.  The  principal  purpose  of  the  EWC  is  to remain a key intermediary in the development of employeemanagement  dialogue  between  European  countries  with differing realities and social practices.\n\nThe EWC is a cross-border institution and operates alongside existing national employee representative bodies in accordance  with  specific  prerogatives  in  terms  of  receiving information  and  being  consulted.  The  discussions  that  take place  within  the  EWC  enable  employee  representatives  to acquire a better knowledge and understanding of the Group's organization, strategy and main challenges.\n\nThe EWC holds two three-day plenary sessions per year with Group  Management,  at  which  it  is  informed  of  and,  where applicable,  consulted  on  cross-border  issues  affecting  the Group's  employees  in  a  manner  defined  in  precise  terms  by the new agreement signed for an indefinite period.\n\nThe  EWC  also  has  a  Select  Committee  composed  of  five members, elected by their peers, who meet at least four times a year to prepare and analyze the two annual plenary sessions and to discuss various issues with Group Management.\n\nIn  2021,  the  members  of  the  EWC  had  their  terms  of  office renewed  for  four  years.  The  EWC  met  on  two  occasions, including one meeting attended by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, while the Select Committee  met  four  times.  Regular  meetings  are  also  held with  the  EWC  secretariat.  The  Council  members  newly appointed  in  each  country  met  in  Paris  on  December  1,  2 and 3, 2021.",

The  Select  Committee met four times.\n\nIn October 2022, the EWC's members took part in three days of in-person training on economic  and  workforce-related matters at a Paris business school. The training was provided by  finance,  union  and  HR  experts  and  related  to  the fundamentals  of  business  economics  and  finance,  European employment  law,  interculturality  and  well-being  at  work. This training plays a vital role in developing the skills of EWC members,  who  have  regularly  addressed  the  financial  and economic issues  relating  to  the  Group  as  well  as  workforcerelated innovations over the last 20 years.\n\nKering's management and EWC members, who cover 100% of the  Group's  workforce  in  Europe  and  51%  of  its  global workforce,  also  met  several  times  in  2022  to  underline the  importance  of  employee-management  dialogue  and well-being  at  work.  After  these  meetings,  a  joint  declaration was  signed  by  Management  and  the  Board  Secretary  in  the EWC's plenary meeting of December 1, 2022.\n\nThe  joint  declaration  aims  to  promote  Kering's  employeerelated  commitments,  which  aim  to  ensure  a  working environment that is stimulating and inclusive and fosters wellbeing at work. These employee-related commitments can be found in the Code of Ethics, the health and safety policy, the Baby  Leave  policy,  the  2020  Global  policy  on  domestic violence and the policy on human rights in the workplace. It also recaps fundamental principles and rights relating to work, including  the  principle  of  a  safe  and  healthy  working environment,  which  was  recognized  as  a  fundamental principle  and  right  by  the  International  Labour  Organization (ILO) in June  2022.  Finally,  the  declaration  provides  a reminder that trusted, constructive and responsible employee-management dialogue within the Group also helps to foster well-being at work.\n\n## 3.4.2.2 The French Works Council\n\nWithin  all  of  its  Houses  in  France,  the  Group  engages  in dialogue with employee representative bodies and as part of negotiations with unions.\n\nCreated in 1993 and renewed most recently in 2015, Kering's French  Works  Council  represents  workers  in  France  and operates under French law. Its members, who meet in plenary sessions once a year, are kept informed of and exchange views on the Group's strategies, economic and financial imperatives, and HR management policy. Each plenary session is preceded by two preparatory meetings of members that allow them to seek expert advice and ask questions of the Board prior to the annual plenary session.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, an agreement renewing the powers and resources attributed to the French Works Council was signed unanimously  by  the  unions  for  an  indefinite  period. In  application  of  this  agreement,  two  days  of  economic  and workforce-related  training  was  provided  to  the  members  of the  Council  on  September  29  and  30,  2021.  The  topics addressed during the physical meetings of the French Works Council  in  April  and  May  and  on  June  4,  2021  included  an update on the social, economic and financial situation of the Group and its Houses, a presentation on the 2021 ethics and compliance  training,  and  a  discussion  relating  to  questions submitted in advance by French Works Council members.\n\nKering  also  took  advantage  of  the  two  days'  training  of  the French  Works  Council  members  to  incorporate  training  on issues relating to employee-management dialogue.\n\nIn  2022,  members  of  the  French  Works  Council  met  three times. On  November  16,  they  undertook  training  on employee-management dialogue in preparation for employee representative  elections  in  the  Group's  Houses.  This  training, provided  by  an  expert  in  workforce  relations,  is  part  of  the four-stage  training  course  that  has  been  delivered  to members  of  the  French  Works  Council  and  the  Houses'  HR managers since 2021 in France.\n\n## 4 WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAINS\n\n## Focus on: Kering's vision of responsible sourcing\n\n## Managing its impacts beyond its own operations: an approach based on transparency and traceability\n\nKering is aware that its social and environmental responsibility goes beyond its own operations and extends throughout its supply chains. The Group further believes that respect for human rights applies to everyone, be they employees, workers in supply chains or members of local communities, which are the key principles documented in the Group's Code of Ethics and human rights policy.\n\nThe Group's responsible sourcing approach is also based on key principles defined in its Suppliers' Charter, as well as the Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers. The Kering Standards: Standards and guidance for responsible production, lay down the Group's requirements in terms of responsible sourcing and traceability of raw materials (see section 5.3.3). Furthermore, Kering helps its suppliers adopt more sustainable practices and has set up its online supplier portal in order to involve suppliers in the Group's objectives and requirements with regard to sustainability.\n\nThe result is a need for transparency and traceability within supply chains for its raw materials - and therefore the need to identify, understand and map those chains - with a view to developing synergies and priority programs wherever significant impacts are found.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For any supplier wanting to work with Kering or one of its Houses, notwithstanding any contractual clauses, compliance with the Charter is a precondition of the business  relationship.  The  Group  requires  its  suppliers  to commit formally to applying high ethical standards themselves and to upholding human rights.\n\nThe  Charter  reminds  them  of  the  need  to  promote  human rights within their production  units  and  among  their subcontractors, and to advise Kering and/or its Houses of any serious  difficulties  in  applying  the  Charter.  Compliance  is further  measured  by  means  of  workforce-related  audits  at production sites (see section 4.2).\n\n## 4.1.1.2 Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers\n\nKering's Sustainability Principles are divided into three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 workforce-related  aspects  related  to  human  rights,  labor rights,  and  health  and  safety,  including  the  elimination  of child labor, forced labor, human trafficking in all its forms and  discrimination,  compliance  with  statutory  working hours, and respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining;\n- \u00b7 environmental  aspects,  such  as  compliance  with  laws  as well  as  restrictive  lists  of  chemicals  defined  by  Kering, environmental management, and waste water treatment;\n- \u00b7 aspects  related  to  the  supply  of  raw  materials  and packaging, including respect for animal welfare and the five related  freedoms,  sourcing  and  traceability  requirements for  a  number  of  key  materials  used  by  Kering,  and  the prohibition  of  certain  substances  and/or  certain  sourcing regions (for reasons related to workforce-related conditions in  the  production  system  -  child  or  forced  labor,  for instance - or environmental issues).\n\nThese principles are available on the Group's website and have been  an  integral  part  of  supplier  contracts  since  2016, alongside  the  Suppliers'  Charter.  Each  supplier  is  in  turn tasked with passing on these principles to its own subcontractor  network  if  it  has  one.  This  document  was updated  in  2021  and  provides  details  of  these  mandatory principles  imposed  by  international  and  national  laws, as well as those embodying Kering's additional requirements and  best  practices.  It  is  consistent  with  the  conventions, agreements  and  major  international  texts  it  references  (ILO and  United  Nations  Conventions,  United  Nations  Guiding Principles on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Ramsar Convention, etc.).\n\n## 4.1.1.3 Responsible purchasing policy\n\nFor  non-retail  (indirect)  purchases,  the  Group's  Indirect Purchasing  Department  remains  committed  to  responsible sourcing based on a reciprocal undertaking with suppliers to respect  the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics.  It  also  has  specific commitments  tailored  to  each  category  of  purchases,  with buyers  identifying  the  most  relevant  sustainability  criteria. To  formalize  this  process,  a  responsible  sourcing  policy  has been implemented at Group level.\n\nIt sets out the priorities to be shared and applied by all Group employees  to  manage  purchasing  ethically  and  responsibly. It  has  been  distributed  to  all  Kering  employees.  Today,  all buyers are trained and made aware of responsible purchasing practices, and all purchases include CSR selection specifications and/or criteria.\n\nKering  further  formalized  these  commitments  in  2014  by signing the 'Responsible Supplier Relations' Charter issued by the  French  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  and  the Compagnie  des  Dirigeants  et  Acheteurs  de  France (French purchasing managers body - CDAF). The Charter's purpose is to promote the implementation of and compliance with best practices in relation to suppliers in France and to encourage the major signatory companies to implement a progress-oriented  approach  with  their  suppliers,  especially small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  in  order  to  develop  a true  partnership  through  mutual  knowledge  and  respect  for each party's rights and duties.\n\nFor Direct Purchases, the Group's Direct Procurement department  remains  committed  in  supporting  all  Kering's Houses  in  reaching  the  2025  goal  of  procuring  100%  raw materials aligned with the Kering Standards. Since 2021, the team has implemented Procurement framework contracts at group  level  to  support  the  purchase  of  raw  materials  in  the form  of  yarns  and  fabrics  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards and  certified,  ensuring  availability  of  key  commodities  at negotiated  prices  and  agreed  lead  times.  A  harmonized methodology  is  applied  to  all  projects  under  Procurement management confirming, at the same time, the creation of a different  strategic  approach  tailored  to  each  commodity based on its  market  characteristics  and  always  guaranteeing alignment with Kering Standards and Procedures.\n\n## 4.1.1.4 Kering Standards: adoption and dissemination\n\nIn  2012,  Kering  set  out  basic  principles  and  guidelines  on responsible sourcing, known  as  the  Kering  Standards: Standards and guidance for sustainable production. A first in the luxury industry, the Standards were published in 2018 and can  be  downloaded  in  English,  Italian  and  French  from  the Group's website.\n\nThe Standards set out the criteria imposed on the Group and its  suppliers  in  five  key  areas:  traceability,  use  of  chemicals, social  impact,  environmental  impact  and  animal  welfare, describing the minimum requirements for Group suppliers in each  of  these  five  areas,  as  well  as  the  more  demanding requirements  that  suppliers  will  have  to  meet  by  2025. They  are  based  on  founding  notions  of  integrity  (material traceability, Chain of Custody certification, etc.), circularity (use of  recycled  materials  where  possible,  consideration  of  the recyclability of products, etc.) and the precautionary principle (no use of GMOs, no nanomaterials, etc.).",

        "page_content": "The Kering Standards cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  raw  materials  used  by  the  Group,  representing  more than  95%  of  purchasing  volumes,  namely  leather  and precious skins, fur alternatives, wool, cashmere, cotton, silk, synthetic  fibers,  paper,  wood,  plastic,  feathers  and  down, cellulosic  fibers,  gold,  diamonds,  colored  gemstones  and silver;\n- \u00b7 the Group's main manufacturing processes, namely tanning,  the  various  stages  of  textile  processing,  leather work and shoes;\n- \u00b7 since  2020:  packaging,  visual  tools  and  innovation  for sustainable production;\n- \u00b7 since 2021: logistics (warehousing and transportation) and rules for managing products at the end of their lifecycle.\n- \u00b7 since  2022:  supplementary  guides  relating  to  circularity, innovation and sustainability claims.\n\nThe  Kering  Standards  are  circulated  within  the  Houses  by means of dedicated training programs provided for suppliers by  the  Houses  and  Material  Innovation  Lab.  An  e-learning module about the Standards has already been taken by more than 6,500 employees. It is available in five languages (English, French,  Italian,  Chinese  and  Japanese)  and  is  designed  to adapt to the learner's profile (design, merchandizing, materials research, product development, purchasing, production/series production, quality, etc.). For each material or process,  it explains  the  related  environmental  and workforce-related  issues,  and  then  sets  out  the  measures  to be taken to ensure responsible sourcing.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2019,  Kering  published  the  Animal  Welfare Standards  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the  best  treatment  for animals throughout the supply chain. These public Standards are the first ever set of full animal welfare standards for luxury and  fashion  and  aim  to  drive  positive  change  in  industry practices, and beyond. They cover all the species that are part of the Group's supply chains around the world, namely cattle and calves,  sheep,  goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles,  alligators  and pythons.  For  each  species,  this  document  highlights  specific challenges, laying down breeding, transportation and slaughtering requirements, and lists benchmark certifications. Kering  has  published  more  detailed  individual  Standards  for cattle,  calves,  sheep  and  goats,  as  well  as  guidelines  for slaughterhouses.  In  2021,  the  Standards  were  updated  to reflect  changes  in  practices  and  experience  from  visits  and audits  within  our  value  chains.  NGOs  such  as  CIWF,  Welfarm and OABA contributed to this update.\n\n## 4.1.2 Helping our suppliers to adopt more sustainable practices\n\nTraining  and  raising  the  awareness  of  suppliers  and  helping them  adopt  best  practices  is  the  preferred  avenue  taken  by the Group and its Houses to achieve tangible improvements in practices  across  their  supply  chains.  The  environmental aspect grew out of the lessons drawn from the EP&L approach and the predominant role played by supply chains (Tiers 1 to 4)  in  the  Group's  environmental  impact:  without  suppliers sharing Kering's commitment and belief in the need for action, potential improvements would be limited.\n\nThe  Group  therefore  acts  at  several  levels,  as  a  Group  and within  each  of  its  Houses,  individually  or  collectively,  rolling out  training  and  awareness  programs  as  well  as  assessment mechanisms.\n\n## 4.1.2.1 Monitoring and assessing suppliers' sustainability performance (Vendor Portal)\n\nIn line with the objective of creating a 'Supplier Sustainability Index'  and  ensuring  its  Standards  are  implemented  by  all suppliers by 2025, Kering implemented a new supplier portal in 2020, which can be accessed online. This portal is a tool for conducting evaluations and sharing information and sustainability practices. Following a pilot phase in 2020/21, Kering has stepped up  its  process  for  collecting  environmental  and  workforcerelated  information  from  its  suppliers.  In  2022,  most  of Kering's  suppliers  in  the  ready-to-wear,  leather  goods  and shoes categories  had  signed  up  to  the  process,  representing 97% of purchases in these categories. At year end 2022, Kering has  organized  11  training  sessions  for  its  suppliers,  which were attended by more than 1,100 people.\n\nThis  portal  allows  for  the  ongoing  assessment,  by  means  of dedicated, comprehensive questionnaires of up to 300 questions, of  how  the  Kering  Standards  are  implemented  across  the supply  chain,  along  with  environmental  performance  and social  performance.  In  2022,  a  specific  questionnaire  on  the implementation  of  the  MRSL  and  the  management  of chemical products was added to the portal. This information is used  to  calculate  the  sustainability  performance  indicators for suppliers and to define the scope of new projects.\n\nThe various indicators show that:\n\n- \u00b7 more  than  700  suppliers  representing  around  74%  of purchasing in the ready-to-wear, leather goods and shoes categories  have  so  far  completed  the  four  questionnaires, submitting a self-assessment of their performance via the portal;\n- \u00b7 all  respondents  acknowledge  that  they  know  the  Group's requirements (Code of Ethics and Suppliers' Charter, MRSL and PRSL, Kering Standards);\n- \u00b7 manufacturing sites state that they mainly buy energy from renewable  sources,  while  around  one  quarter  generate energy on site;\n- \u00b7 668 production sites related to 349 suppliers, representing 40% of purchases in the ready-to-wear, leather goods and shoes categories have shared data regarding their water consumption.\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  are  striving  to  develop  long-lasting relationships  with  their  suppliers,  in  a  spirit  of  trust  and continuous collaboration. For instance, long term partnerships between brands and suppliers play a pivotal role in preserving, sharing and improving key know-how in a mutually beneficial way, and in ensuring the manufacturing of iconic pieces. As an example,  the  average  relationship  length  between  Gucci  and its Leather Goods & Shoes suppliers amounts to 14 years.\n\nIn addition to the Vendor Portal, the Houses have made other commitments, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent  has  developed  a  set  of  specific  Key Performance  Indicators  (KPIs)  for  its  supplier  evaluation system in its leather tanneries (see section 5.3.3.2);\n- \u00b7 in addition to the Vendor Portal's questionnaires, Gucci also assesses  its  own  suppliers  across  all  its  business  units through  dedicated  questionnaires  covering  the  various aspects of their CSR approach: certifications and management systems  in  place,  understanding  of  the  Kering  Standards, water and energy consumption, carbon footprint, waste and chemical product management, gender equality and employee well-being.  The  KPIs  have  been  defined  in  line  with  the Kering Standards, traceability requirements and the MRSL, as well as with suppliers' maturity in terms of sustainability. The  Gucci  Sustainability  Principles  set  out  the  Houses' requirements  on  top  of  the  Kering  Group's  Suppliers' Charter and its Sustainability Principles (see section 4.1.1).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Around 150 suppliers took part.\n\nThe Group and its Houses also encourage - wherever relevant, particularly with respect to the size of suppliers - the use of certifications  in  internationally  recognized  standards  for environmental  management  systems  (e.g.  ISO  14001),  labor relations (SA8000) and health and safety (ISO 45001).\n\n## Focus on: Kering's project on gender equality in the supply chain in Italy with the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana\n\nSince 2019, Kering and its Houses - Gucci, Kering Eyewear, Pomellato and Saint Laurent, under the leadership of Bottega Veneta  -  have  made  a  commitment  alongside  their  suppliers  to  support  diversity  and  gender  equality.  This  project,  in collaboration with the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI) has led to:\n\n- \u00b7 the publication in 2019 of a study into the role of women in the supply chains of the Italian luxury industry. The study was  produced  with  three  specialist  associations  (BSR,  Valore  D  and  Wise  Growth),  and  made  recommendations  for improving gender equality with four key aspects: working conditions and economic opportunities, leadership and career advancement, motherhood, and workplace conduct and harassment;\n- \u00b7 a dedicated event for suppliers organized during Milan Fashion Week in 2020, which attracted 200 suppliers;\n- \u00b7 a  series  of  18  training  sessions  for  key  suppliers  of  the  Houses  (covering  all  job  roles)  between  late  2020  and  2022, in which more than 500 people took part. These sessions looked at the issues of women's empowerment at work, worklife balance and self-awareness;\n- \u00b7 an  assessment  of  the  effects  of  this  training  showed  a  15%  reduction  in  prejudice  about  the  role  of  women  in  the workplace and a 25% improvement in participants' well-being at work.\n\n## 4.1.2.2 Awareness and capacity building\n\nThe  Material  Innovation  Lab  (MIL)  interacts  with  the  Houses, textile  manufacturers  and  other  external  stakeholders  in  the Group's  supply  chains  to  foster  a  structured,  integrated approach to developing environmentally and socially responsible  supply  chains.  Group  best  practice  has  been developed with the Houses to:\n\n- \u00b7 promote change management  in  material sourcing dynamics by integrating farm to garment supply chains into each Houses' operations;\n- \u00b7 raise  awareness  on  the  importance  of  transparency  and traceability  for  materials  sourcing,  in  line  with  the  Kering Standards;\n- \u00b7 enable capacity building of internal procedure to test and implement  innovative  solutions  (technologies,  materials, processing, etc..).\n\nOutside the Group, training is offered to textile manufacturers and supply chain stakeholders to:\n\n- \u00b7 advice  them  on  how  to  be  aligned  material  sourcing  to Kering Standards;\n- \u00b7 raise  awareness  on  Kering's  Sustainability  initiatives  (eg. Kering Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature)  so  that  they understand the new frontiers of sustainable practices (eg. regenerative agricultural practices);\n- \u00b7 engage commercial and business teams to strengthen their approach to sustainable sourcing;\n- \u00b7 encourage  building  up  new  commercial  relationship  with new  sustainable  actors  to  promote  enviromentally  and\n\nsocially responsible supply chains (eg. regenerative cashmere sourcing program).\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  also  help  their  suppliers  implement projects  intended  to  reduce  their  environmental  footprint, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 initiatives adopted by logistics teams to reduce the carbon footprint of their activities;\n- \u00b7 the Clean by Design project (see section 5.2.2.4);\n- \u00b7 the  project  initiated  in  2021  by  Saint  Laurent  and Balenciaga for their denim suppliers in Japan, to assess the environmental  performance  of  the  various  participants  in the supply chain (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3) and help them to improve  their  practices  with  regard  to  water  and  energy consumption,  waste  management,  wastewater  treatment and  management  of  chemical  products  (application  of Kering's  MRSL  and  PRSL).  In  2022,  the  first  phase  of  the project,  including  site  visits  and  analysis,  was  completed. The subsequent phases, including operational recommendations and monitoring, will continue in 2023;\n- \u00b7 programs  developed  in  collaboration  with  participants  in the  various  raw  materials  supply  chains,  as  detailed  in section 5.3.3.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses,  including  Balenciaga,  Boucheron and  Saint  Laurent,  are  also  committed  to  working  with organizations  in  the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE), particularly  through  contracts  for  on-site  services  and  pilot projects.  Kering  Eyewear  has  also  formed  a  partnership  with CAUTO Cooperativa Sociale , a network of social cooperatives in Italy that helps integrate disabled people.",

        "page_content": "## Focus on: the Gucci program to support supply chain sustainable transition\n\nIn May 2020, Gucci and Italian bank Intesa SanPaolo launched the Sviluppo Filiere partnership program to support suppliers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was extended in 2021 and continued in 2022, allowing small and mediumsized  enterprises  within  Gucci  supply  chain  to  benefit  from  facilitated  access  to  loans  with  advantageous  terms  and conditions to launch their own industrial evolution in accordance with the principles of the green revolution and ecological transition  supported  by  Italy's  National  Recovery  and  Resilience  Plan.  These  loans  can  be  used,  among  others,  towards energy  efficiency  and  saving,  development  of  renewable  energy  production  facilities,  adaptation  of  business  models  to facilitate  the  development  of  a  circular  economy,  management  of  hazardous  chemicals  and  the  definition  and implementation of welfare policies  and  instruments  aimed  at  ensuring  equality  and  reducing  the  gender  gap.  With  this program, Gucci and Intesa SanPaolo are therefore seeking to support the Made in Italy production chain. By the end of 2022, 189 Gucci suppliers had been able to access loans totalling more than \u20ac333 million since launch.\n\n## 4.2 Action to improve working conditions in our supply chains\n\nKering's  initiatives  in  respect  of  working  conditions  in  its supply  chains  form  part  of  the  Group's  analysis  of  nonfinancial  risks  and  the  Group's  human  rights  approach,  and relate  to  its  duty  of  care  as  presented  in  chapter  5  \"Risk management and internal control\".\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, Kering adopted initiatives to support its  suppliers during the pandemic, and the Houses were also able to devise specific action plans in parallel. The pandemic and related restrictions continued to have an impact in 2022, particularly in the first few months of the year. However, the frequency  of  audits  returned  to  a  level  similar  to  that  seen pre-COVID.\n\n## 4.2.1 Implementation of the workforcerelated audit system within the Group\n\nNo control system, regardless of how mature and tested it is, can guarantee the absence of risk, and it is up to the Group and its Houses to develop the most efficient collaborative and control  systems  with  suppliers  in  order  to  keep  risk  to  a minimum and implement any corrective action in cases where non-compliance is identified.\n\nSince 2016, the Group has had a single central body allowing Kering to control the compliance  of  Group  suppliers, combining audit and risk assessment practices, known as the Hercules  system.  This  system  is  built  on  the  following  six pillars:\n\n- 1. the Sustainability Principles established for all the Luxury Houses in 2015 and updated in 2021, which are divided into  three  areas:  social  aspects  related  to  human  rights, labor rights, and health and safety; environmental aspects; and  aspects  related  to  raw  materials  sourcing  and packaging (see section 4.1.1 for details);\n- 2. a  central  management  by  Kering  through  a  team  of  30 people (one Director, one Manager, 15 auditors specializing in conducting supplier audits and monitoring anomalies,  nine  people  dedicated  to  management,  and four planners). Depending on needs (locations, workload, etc.),  this  team  is  assisted  by  external  service  providers that apply the same auditing methodology;\n- 3. clear and  uniform  procedures  for  all  the  Houses, corresponding  to  the  different  stages  of  the  supplier relationship, including the activation procedure, monitoring procedure, and termination-of-contract procedure;\n- 4. audit plans that are regularly updated to take into account new  suppliers  and  exclude  those  that  have  become inactive.  The  risk  assessments  and  audit  plans  are constructed on the basis of a set of gross risks and prior social audit performance;\n- 5. A single and comprehensive audit methodology, including not  only  the  key  chapters  relating  to  social  compliance, but also the essential components relating to health and safety, and environmental management.  Containing 97  questions,  the  comprehensive  audit  questionnaire  is divided into 13 categories (child labor, forced labor, health and  safety,  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining,  discrimination,  the  environment, etc.) and is aligned with the best standards in the field, in particular the SA8000 and SMETA standards. Findings are consolidated  between  the  Houses  in  order  to  avoid  any overlap  in  the  audits.  Follow-up  audits  with  a  smaller scope  focus  on  the  area(s)  in  which  breaches  of compliance  were  identified  or  observations  were  made during the first comprehensive audit. In all cases, audits both announced and unannounced - consist of document reviews,  site  tours,  and  worker  interviews.  Workers  are selected  to  be  representative  of  the  workforce,  notably concerning  age  and  union  affiliation,  if  any.  These interviews  are  confidential.  The  frequency  of  audits depends on the results of previous audits, meaning that better-rated  suppliers  will  be  audited  less  frequently. Nevertheless,  periodic  audits  are  undertaken  regularly  to ensure  compliance.  In  2022,  the  teams  have  launched  a comprehensive review of the current social audit protocol and  associated  check  lists  in  order  to  capture  rising regulatory  expectations  and  best  practices  in  this  area. The changes will be implemented in 2023;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Immediate  shutdown  of  the  approval  process  if  the supplier  is  in  the  process  of  being  activated  but  has not  started  working;  and  discussions  about  the possibility of remediation and support for the supplier or  about  the  need  to  terminate  the  contractual relationship if the supplier is working on one or more orders.  The  House  makes  the  decision  about  what  is the most appropriate response,\n- c) moderate compliance breach:\n\nthe  supplier  is  given  three  months  to  resolve  the moderate compliance breach, and a follow-up audit is scheduled to confirm that the issue has been resolved.\n\n- d) observations:\n\nthese give rise to a corrective action plan and are the subject  of  a  dedicated  checklist  at  the  next  audit. The supplier has six months to remedy the observation.\n\nFor  each  of  the  13  categories  in  the  comprehensive audit  questionnaire,  a  detailed  description  of  what constitutes zero-tolerance breaches, serious or moderate compliance breaches and observations has been prepared. For example, in the health and safety category, any situation that may endanger the lives of workers  is  a  zero-tolerance  breach;  the  absence  of mandatory  documentation  on  aspects  capable  of endangering  the  health  or  safety  of  employees  is  a serious compliance breach; the absence of mandatory documentation other than that addressing the health or safety of workers is a moderate compliance breach; and a deviation from existing procedures results in an observation. In the social category, the falsification of a certificate proving  payment  of  social  security contributions  is  a  zero-tolerance  breach;  any  issue relating to the minimum wage is a serious compliance breach; a failure to comply with updates to collective bargaining  agreements  is  a  moderate  compliance breach;  and  a  failure  to  implement  laws  to  promote the  professional  integration  of  vulnerable  people results in an observation.\n\nDepending on the results of audits, suppliers are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 compliant  (no  zero-tolerance  breaches,  no  compliance breaches,  whether  serious  or  moderate,  fewer  than  five observations);\n- \u00b7 partially compliant (no zero-tolerance breaches, no serious compliance breaches, fewer than five moderate breaches);\n- \u00b7 progress expected (no zero-tolerance breaches, more than five moderate compliance breaches or at least one serious breach);\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance (at least one zero-tolerance breach).\n\n## 4.2.2 Supply chain map\n\nAs a Group of leading global Houses, Kering operates in the luxury market, with supply chains that are structured in a very specific way, as evidenced by the location of the suppliers in the centrally managed database in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Supplier portfolio                                                                             | Size of suppliers                                                                                                             | Geographical location of Kering's suppliers in 2022                 |                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Thousands of mostly small  suppliers, highly  fragmented market, high  level of craftsmanship. | Average number of  employees per supplier:  approximately 56.

        "page_content": "## 4.2.3 2022 results of supplier audits and key indicators\n\nSubcontracting without prior authorization is not permitted.\n\nThe  supplier  base  managed  by  Kering's  central  team  for  its Houses has the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 it does not yet include all suppliers, but it does now include all production  suppliers,  the  main  suppliers  of  raw materials  (leather,  fabrics,  ribbons,  precious  stones,  etc.), Kering Eyewear suppliers and suppliers deemed strategic;\n- \u00b7 to  date,  it  covers  4,745  suppliers,  with  the  following breakdown:\n- - 35% Tier 1 suppliers (17% of direct suppliers that do not use  subcontractors  and  18%  of  contractors  that  use subcontractors);\n- - 65% subcontractors,  i.e.  those  that  work  for  contractors and have no direct business relationship with the Houses (Tier 2 suppliers).\n\n9.3%  of  suppliers  were  deemed  strategic  in  2022.  Strategic suppliers are those needed to ensure business continuity due to  the  volume  of  production  involved  and/or  their  specific know-how.  Furthermore,  out  of  the  total  number  of  active suppliers in 2022, 4.9% were deemed \"at risk\" because they are located in countries considered by the Group to be \"at risk\". A country is deemed to be at risk when the indicators contained in  various  external  databases  imply  that  human  rights  risks are high or very high.\n\n14.1% of suppliers were deemed critical in 2022 (of which 71% were in Tier 1 and 29% in Tier 2). Suppliers are deemed critical when  they  are  strategic  and/or  at  risk.  If  they  meet  both criteria,  they  are  only  counted  once.  They  are  given  special attention in view of their importance to the business and their location.\n\nAmong  its  suppliers,  Kering  also  distinguishes  raw  material suppliers.  Raw  materials  suppliers  identified  as  key  to  the Group represent roughly 20% of all such suppliers, corresponding to approximately 80% of purchases.\n\nLastly,  for  a  limited  portion  of  its  activities  (fragrances  and cosmetics),  Kering  also  works  with  licensed  suppliers,  i.e. those that are under license to the Houses.\n\nWithin this portfolio of suppliers, 4,118 audits were conducted in  2022  (compared  with  3,420  in  2021  and  2,399  in  2020), breaking  down  as  2,068  comprehensive  audits  and  2,050 follow-up audits. A total of 35% of these audits were carried out  by  Kering's  Internal  Audit  team  and  65%  by  external auditors,  with  the  Group  audit  protocol  applied  in  the  same way  for  all  audits  conducted.  This  means  that  64  %  of suppliers were audited in 2022. 91% of suppliers were audited in  2015-2022.  Some  of  these  audits  concern  suppliers  that have become inactive: 347 of the audits carried out in 2022 covered  suppliers  that  were  inactive  at  the  end  of  the  year, and 55% of the suppliers in the system that are now inactive have been audited since 2015.\n\nMoreover,  Kering  has  undertaken  to  audit  all  of  its  key suppliers every two years. It should be noted that 'activation' audits  for  new  suppliers  are  comprehensive  audits,  and  that they  therefore  cover  the  entire  scope  of  a  comprehensive audit.\n\nFinally, with the aim of going further back in its supply chain, Kering has initiated a new series of audits in 2022, targeting raw material suppliers (such as a silkworm farm in Italy).\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the 11,948 anomalies broke down as follows:\n\n## Breakdown by severity of anomalies as of December 31, 2022\n\n## Breakdown by severity of anomalies recorded at critical Tier 1 suppliers as of December 31, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBreakdown by theme of the top five anomalies recorded (excluding observations) as of December 31, 2022\n\nBreakdown by theme of the top five anomalies recorded (excluding observations) at critical Tier 1 suppliers as of December 31, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing these audits, 64.8% of suppliers were rated compliant, 29.5%  partially  compliant,  4.6%  progress  expected  and  1.1% zero  tolerance.  A  total  of  57  suppliers  saw  their  business relationship  terminated  in  2022  due  to  unsatisfactory  audit results.\n\nRobust corrective action plans were put together following the audits,  wherever  breaches  of  compliance,  and  particularly serious breaches, were identified. Follow-up audits were then conducted  to  verify  the  resolution  of  the  problem.  The zero-tolerance  breaches  identified  during  the  audits  were dealt with immediately, in accordance with established rules and in coordination with the relevant Houses. To speed up the resolution  of  issues,  the  central  team  held  more  than  405 committee meetings with the Houses. This process aimed at continuous improvement led to resolution of several serious compliance breaches and zero tolerance situations.\n\nFor  example,  in  2022  a  House  required  the  central  team  to perform an audit to reactivate a supplier that had in the past been  terminated  because  of  a  breach  regarding  wages.  This new audit confirmed that the breach had been resolved.\n\nAnother example involved a supplier found to have a breach regarding working hours and overtime. Based on the findings of  the  audit  team,  a  plan  of  action  was  agreed,  under  which the  number  of  overtime  hours  worked  each  month  was reduced. The follow-up audit confirmed that the company was compliant with regulations.\n\nFinally,  a  breach  was  found  at  another  supplier,  which  had failed to comply with applicable health and safety regulations. Corrective action allowed that supplier to obtain some of the missing  documentation;  the  rest  of  the  observations  will  be assessed in a follow-up audit.\n\n## 4.2.4 Beyond workforce-related audits: social impact\n\nAdopting social impact initiatives, including measuring it and taking into account its various categories, requires sustained dialogue  and  active  collaboration  with  a  wide  range  of stakeholders, including private-sector peers faced with similar challenges,  international  organizations  that  are  leading  the way on this topic, and technical partners that can contribute their expertise to discussions, such as living wage. Accordingly, Kering has been engaged in several initiatives and collaborations  to  develop  its  approach  and  explore  priority areas of action for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering  is  an  active  member  of  the  B4IG  (Business  for Inclusive Growth) coalition. B4IG was founded in 2019 and is a partnership between the OECD and major corporations around  the  world,  which  are  committed  to  combating inequality  and  building  more  inclusive  growth  models. By  sharing  best  practices,  developing  new  solutions, launching pilot programs and developing measurements to assess inclusive growth efforts more effectively, B4IG shows how  companies  can  encourage  this  inclusive  growth. Kering  is  particularly  active  in  four  working  groups,  i.e. (i) Living  Wage,  (ii)  Human  Rights,  (iii)  Social  Metrics Disclosures & Impact and (iv) Diversity & Inclusion. In 2022, Kering  hosted  the  first  in-person  workshop  for  the coalition.\n- \u00b7 Kering is also a member of the Capitals Coalition, a global non-profit platform that supports the use of different types of  capitals  (particularly  human,  natural  and  social)  when companies make strategic decisions on these matters.\n\nKering  is  continuing  its  collaboration  with  the Fair  Wage Network in order to pursue its efforts around living wage in its supply chains.\n\n## 5 RESPECTING AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR OPERATIONS AND VALUE CHAIN\n\nKering's environmental approach constitutes the Care pillar of the  Group's  Sustainability  Strategy,  and  is  based  on  five  key goals:\n\n- 1. aim for the highest level of environmental protection;\n- 2. make  environmental  concerns  central  to  the  Houses' activity by involving all stakeholders along the entire value chain;\n- 3. go  beyond  mere  compliance  with  legal  environmental obligations through a macro-environment approach such as that of the EP&L;\n- 4. drive  the  Group's  sustainability  leadership,  through  a collaborative approach that favors the sharing of best practice, progress and results with competitors and stakeholders;\n\n- 5. bring a culture of innovation to both the business model and the supply chain in order to integrate new technologies that significantly reduce environmental impacts.\n\nThe strategy defines both the goals set by the Group in terms of improving its environmental footprint and the main drivers of  improvement,  namely  sourcing  and  design.  The  Climate Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Circularity Ambition jointly define Kering's framework for action in environmental protection. In operational terms, this vision is expressed in the two  strategic  management  tools:  the  EP&L,  which  measures its  environmental  impacts  across  its  various  supply  chains, even  outside  the  regulatory  framework,  and  the  Kering Standards, supplemented by ad hoc guidelines and tools.",

The Group has undertaken to reduce its EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025 compared with 2015 (in \u20ac thousand in revenue ) .\n\nThe EP&L serves primarily as a decision-making tool providing input into the Group's sustainability projects and guiding the day-to-day choices of decision-makers, with the ultimate goal of  reducing the environmental impact of both Kering and its supply  chains.  Going  further  than  traditional  environmental reporting,  the  EP&L  covers  six  categories  of  environmental impact:  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  air  pollution,  water pollution, water consumption, waste production and land use. It  allows  Kering  and  its  Houses  to  measure  their  impacts  on natural  capital  throughout  their  value  chains  and  assign  a monetary value to them. The EP&L results, particularly via their monetization, make it possible to:\n\n- \u00b7 translate  environmental  impacts  into  a  common  business language;\n- \u00b7 compare environmental impacts between separate units;\n- \u00b7 compare,  for  any  given  environmental  indicator,  the magnitude of an impact for different locations;\n- \u00b7 facilitate comparisons between Houses and business units;\n- \u00b7 ultimately, choose between and prioritize actions.\n\nThe  results  should  not  be  seen  as  a  liability  or  a  cost  for Kering. Rather, they represent a way of assessing the cost to society of environmental  changes  stemming  from  the activities of the Group and its suppliers, by taking account of\n\nlocal contexts and  the  impacts  on  local  populations. The construction of the EP&L draws on databases containing a level  of  uncertainty  inherent  in  the  principle  of  evaluating environmental  impacts  using  LCA  methods  (Life  Cycle Analysis) and economic modeling tools.\n\nIn 2022, Kering continued its work, seeking to:\n\n- \u00b7 accelerate  the  production  of  EP&L  results  by  automating the data submission process and moving closer to financial consolidation  processes.  The  creation  of  the  Sustainable Finance  department  in  2022  will  speed  up  convergence between ESG and finance data (see section 5.2.1.2);\n- \u00b7 increase  the  reliability  of  the  data  used  in  the  EP&L  by strengthening  control  processes.  The  voluntary  limited assurance for its EP&L data by an independent third-party organization,  renewed  in  2022,  is  included  at  the  end  of this  NFIS.  This  method  strengthens  Kering's  approach  and increases confidence among stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 widen the perimeter, particularly by including environmental impacts related to technological and digital tools.  Digitalization  is  a  key  area  of  development  for  the Luxury industry and is an integral part of Kering's strategy. As a result, the use of data, digital tools and IT hardware is increasing  rapidly,  which  is  why  Kering  has  broadened  its EP&L methodology to include those impacts.\n\nIn  line  with  its  commitment  to  be  transparent,  Kering  is sharing its 2022 results, together with the coefficients used in the  calculations  (monetized  multipliers)  on  the  open-source platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com. In addition, a methodological note specific to the EP&L is available on the Group's website. It sets out the framework used and highlights the key methodological elements that shape the process and the calculations, including monetization aspects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5.1.2 Internal organization and management\n\n## 5.1.2.1 Internal organization and managing the network\n\nIn addition to the organization and governance of Sustainability within the Group  (see  section  1.5), the management  of  the  Group's  environmental  objectives  and their  operational  application  draws  on  multi-disciplinary committees,  bringing  together  other  key  functions  at  Kering and its Houses to ensure the implementation and application of sustainability projects.\n\nIn  2022,  Kering  pressed  ahead  with  its  Idea  Labs:  working groups  bringing  together  experts  and  operational  employees from  several  Houses  with  a  view  to  sharing  knowledge, devising  and  developing  new  ideas,  and  implementing practical  solutions,  particularly  in  terms  of  improving  the Group's environmental and societal footprints. During the year, 22 Idea Labs sessions took place, each attended by between 15 and 50 employees who discussed the following issues:\n\n- \u00b7 the Kering Standards: Standards and guidance for sustainable production;\n- \u00b7 energy-saving measures and purchases of green energy;\n- \u00b7 eco-designed packaging and the elimination of single-use plastics;\n- \u00b7 traceability and transparency in operations and supply chains;\n- \u00b7 sourcing of natural raw materials;\n- \u00b7 changes in regulations regarding circularity and environmental labeling;\n- \u00b7 animal welfare;\n- \u00b7 raw materials: leather, precious skins, cashmere, fur alternatives, cotton  and  precious  metals  (gold,  silver,  palladium)  for jewelry and the galvanization of metal parts;\n- \u00b7 best practice in client communication on sustainability;\n- \u00b7 focus on jewelry-specific issues.\n\n## 5.1.2.2 Training on reporting tools, indicators and processes\n\nKering develops systems such as the environmental reporting system, or  EP&L,  along  with  standards  for  raw  materials  and production  processes  to  help  the  Houses  manage  their environmental impact.\n\nProduced  each  year  since  2003,  the  Group's  environmental reporting  draws  on  around  100  indicators.  These  indicators are  representative  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's Houses,  and  fall  into  eight  categories:  energy  consumption, water consumption, water pollution, management of environmental  risks,  goods  transportation,  business  travel, waste production and use of raw materials.\n\nTo  ensure  consistent,  standardized  reporting  practices  are used across the Group, specific training is provided every year on  these  tools,  complemented  by  annual  updates  to  guides and handbooks in three languages, and supported by internal communication  through  the  Group's  corporate  social  media platform.\n\nA  methodological  note  provides  all  necessary  information regarding  the  environmental  reporting  protocol,  emission factors  and  rules  and  calculation  methods  for  estimated  or extrapolated  pro  forma  data,  to  allow  comparisons  over  a three-year  period  along  with  methodological  clarifications regarding  the  application  of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation.  It  is available in the Sustainability/Measuring our impact/Reporting and indicators section of the Group's website (Methodological Note - Environmental Reporting, 2022).\n\n## 5.1.2.3 Certification procedures\n\nThe number of Group sites for which certification is relevant is limited due to the nature of the Group's activities. Certifications related to the implementation of environmental management systems, such as ISO 14001, are sought primarily for the sites with the greatest environmental impact, such as large  logistics  centers  and  tanneries.  By  end-2022,  all tanneries  owned  by  the  Group  had  received  ISO  14001 certification,  and  86%  had  LWG  (Leather  Working  Group) certification. Some Houses are upgrading their environmental certification  to  include  ISO  14064,  which  is  specific  to  the quantification and  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) emissions.\n\nSome  sites  have  also  received  certification  for  health  and safety (ISO 45001), social accountability (SA8000) and quality management (ISO 9001). All Gucci's Italian stores and outlets have  both  SA  8000  and  ISO  45001  certification,  and  its production  sites  and  offices  are  also  ISO  14001  and ISO  45001-certified.  In  2019,  Gucci  also  attained  ISO  20121 Sustainable  Events  (fashion  shows  and  advertisements) certification for its Guccio Gucci business.\n\n## 5.1.3 Identification of Group economic activities covered by European \"Green Taxonomy\" regulation\n\n## 5.1.3.1 The principles and key performance indicators of the \"Green Taxonomy\"\n\nThis  section  has  been  prepared  by  the  Kering  Group  in application of European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the Green Taxonomy  Regulation)  and  delegated  acts (EU) 2021/2139 and (EU) 2021/2178, which aims to facilitate environmentally sustainable investments.\n\nThe  \"Green  Taxonomy\"  seeks  to  identify  economic  activities that  meet  at  least  one  of  the  following  six  environmental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 climate change mitigation;\n- \u00b7 climate change adaptation;\n- \u00b7 the  sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources;\n- \u00b7 the transition to a circular economy;\n- \u00b7 pollution prevention and control;\n- \u00b7 the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  date,  economic activities \"eligible\" for the \"Green Taxonomy\" are defined only with  regards  to  the  first  two  objectives,  i.e.  climate  change mitigation  and  adaptation  (Annexes  I  and  II  to  the  Climate Delegated Act). Within the framework of these two objectives, the activities targeted are those that contribute significantly to greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  European  Union  or  that propose solutions to adapt to climate change. Companies are thus required to publish for the 2022 financial year, the three indicators:  revenue,  CAPEX  and  OPEX  corresponding  to  the eligible  share  since  2021,  and  from  2022,  the  aligned  share considered sustainable according to the regulation for the two climate  objectives.  The  'Green  Taxonomy'  should  be  more representative  of  the  environmental  issues  specific  to  the Group's  activities  when  it  is  extended  to  the  other  four environmental objectives by 2024. The Group will review the reporting  methodology  and  the  resulting  figures  in  line  with regulatory developments.\n\nDetails about the methodology are provided in Kering's note to its environmental reporting available on its website.\n\n## 5.1.3.2 Kering's application of the Taxonomy\n\nAs  a  Group  focused  on  the  luxury  industry,  Kering  has  not identified activities corresponding to its business in Appendices  I  and  II  of  the  Taxonomy.  The  Group  must nonetheless produce a report relating to CAPEX and OPEX as defined by the Regulation.\n\nGiven the absence of eligible revenue, the analysis of eligible CAPEX focused on investments related to assets or expenditure eligible for the Taxonomy on an individual basis. Thus,  the  main  CAPEX  targeted  are  real-estate  assets,  in particular new leases, which are eligible to the Taxonomy, as well as investments related to energy efficiency. It should be noted that, for Kering, the GHG emissions currently targeted by the Taxonomy  Regulation  only  concern  buildings  and, therefore,  represent  less  than  3%  of  Kering's  total  GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the GHG protocol).\n\n## Revenue\n\nKering's eligible and aligned revenue is nil for 2022.",

This  can  in  turn  generate  adverse  human  health impacts (malnutrition, disease), risks of disruption to economic activities, reduced agricultural yields, desertification and other serious disturbances of ecosystem services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  2022  EP&L  results  show  that  38%  of  Kering's monetized  environmental  impacts  relate  to  greenhouse  gas emissions, and that they mostly happen in Tier 4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\n## 5.2.1 Kering Climate Strategy: adapting our business model to address climate issues\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Our climate trajectory and Science Based Targets (SBTs)\n\nKering has made climate action a key part of its sustainability strategy, aiming for a Net Zero trajectory consistent with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2016, Kering was the first luxury goods group verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets. In 2021, the Group revised its SBTs to adopt the  1.5\u00b0C  scenario.  Kering  has  therefore  made  the  following commitments through 2030, based on its 2015 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 90% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from Kering  operations  (whole  of Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol Scopes 1 and 2);\n- \u00b7 70%  reduction  in  the  intensity  of  supply  chain-related greenhouse gas emissions (Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3), consistent with the EP&L objectives.\n\nKering aims to achieve this by:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing emissions;\n- \u00b7 offsetting emissions that cannot be reduced;\n- \u00b7 taking into account material climate-related risks (physical risks and transition risks) for greater resilience.\n\nTo meet these targets, Kering has developed a Climate Strategy based on four main areas:\n\n1. Mitigation of climate-related risks through emissions reduction\n\n2. Adaptation and resilience thanks to nature-based solutions\n\n## 3. Positive contributions to climate change mitigation\n\n## 4. Industry transformation\n\nAs part of the Fashion Pact, Kering and the other participating companies  have  committed,  among  other  things,  to  take action  to  achieve  the  objective  of  net-zero  greenhouse  gas emissions  by  2050,  in  order  to  keep  global  warming  below 1.5\u00b0C between now and 2100.\n\nThe Group's Climate Strategy is available online on the Group's website. It defines Kering's ambitions and provides details of all  targets  in  the  area  as  well  as  the  means  of  action  and measurement.  Kering  received  a  CDP  Climate  Change  2022 rating of A and is included on the Climate A list. The Group's response is publicly accessible on kering.com and www.cdp.net websites.",

The  cooperation  with sustainability  and  operational  teams  plays  a  major  role  in accelerating the transition to business models that take social and  environmental  challenges  into  account.  Accordingly, in 2022 Kering created a department focused on Sustainable Finance. Its remit includes overseeing non-financial performance  (social  and  environmental),  which  helps  with financial  planning  relating  to  energy  transition  and  the decarbonization  of  the  Group's  business;  ensuring  that  the Group  complies  with  the  current  and  future  regulatory framework  as  regards  non-financial  reporting  and  green finance; and ensuring that social and environmental issues are factored  into  the  Group's  management  and  decision-making processes, particularly regarding investments and M&A.\n\nFunding for the transition is already being provided in various operational  areas:  sourcing  of  raw  materials  with  the Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature,  help  for  suppliers  adopting more  responsible  production  processes,  including  the  Clean by  Design  program,  the  Group's  energy  consumption  and  in particular  its  purchases  of  renewable  electricity,  Group  site construction and renovation programs involving all certification  procedures,  and  the  \u20ac100  million  invested  by Kering in the Climate Fund for Nature.\n\nA signatory since 2017, Kering has committed to implementing  recommendations  from  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  the  benchmark framework for reporting on physical and transitional climate risks.  Kering  has  conducted  an  initial  assessment  of  the financial  impact  of  specific  climate  risks.  Kering  intends  to refine  this  initial  work  as  part  of  a  process  of  continuous improvement and to take account of future developments in methodology.  A  cross-business  working  group  made  up  of key functions (finance, financial communication, risk management)  has  been  set  up  since  2020,  under  the leadership  of  the  Sustainability  Department  and  with  the support  of  internal  and  external  experts.  Its  work  began  in 2021  and  continued  in  2022,  covering  the  development  of climate  scenarios  and  an  initial  exercise  to  evaluate  the potential financial impacts of certain risks and opportunities. Progress made was presented to Executive Management and the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Group's governance of climate-related risks and opportunities  is  fully  integrated  into  its  governance  of sustainability, described in detail in section 1.5 and in Chapter 3 'Governance' of the present document.\n\n## Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Setting  the  Group's  strategic  direction,  which  includes climate  change  matters  and  sustainability  issues  more generally.  The  Sustainability  Committee  supervises  the Group's  Climate  Strategy.  In  addition  to  considering progress  by  the  Group,  the  Committee  examines  subjects such  as  carbon  offsetting,  as  well  as  the  physical  and transitional risks relating to climate change.\n- \u00b7 Including  the  subject  in  the  agenda  of  Board  meetings  at least twice a year.\n- \u00b7 Appointment  of  a  Climate  Change  Lead  in  2022  with  the role of ensuring that climate issues are taken into account as part of a long-term approach (see description in section 1.6 of chapter 3).\n\nExecutive Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 The Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer is a member of the Executive Committee and reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She is responsible for the definition and implementation of the sustainability strategy. She  evaluates  and  manages  the  risks  and opportunities  relating  to  climate  change  at  a  Group  level, through the implementation of sustainability action plans and projects;\n\nIncorporation into executive pay:\n\n- \u00b7 The variable elements of the remuneration of the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Group  Managing  Director are  in  part  linked  to  non-financial  criteria  (in  2022, sustainability  represented  10%  of  the  criteria  for  annual variable  remuneration  and  biodiversity  10%  of  those  for multi-annual variable remuneration).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Aligned  with  the  Group's  Climate Strategy and SBT 1.5\u00b0C objectives, this scenario is based on a  strong  response  from  governments  and  international institutions,  high  carbon  prices,  significant  awarenessraising among consumers regarding climate change and its consequences,  and,  more  generally,  actions  to  anticipate and mitigate climate change.\n- \u00b7 a 'business as usual' scenario, based on warming of around 4\u00b0C by 2100. This scenario is based on limited intervention from  governments  and  international  institutions,  low carbon  prices,  increasing  pressure  on  trade,  economic stagnation  or  contraction  and,  more  generally,  a  primarily reactive adaptation to climate change.\n\nTwo  time  horizons  were  considered:  2035  (short  term)  and 2055 (long term).\n\nFor  both  scenarios,  assumptions  were  based  on  scientific research,  most  notably  the  RCP2.6,  RCP4.5  and  RCP8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways from the Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  and modeling  from  experts  including  the  International  Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank and World Resource Institute. These scenarios  also  took  account  of  the  recommendations  of  ISO 14090/91,  the  TCFD  and  the  Institute  4  Climate  Economics (I4CE).\n\nAlso drawing on the results of Kering's EP&L, the whole value chain  was  included  in  the  analysis  framework  for  Kering's scenarios.\n\nThese scenarios fed into the assessment of risks for the Group (see Chapter 5 of this document).\n\n## Risks and opportunities identified\n\nDrawing  on  these  two  scenarios,  Kering  mapped  climaterelated risks and opportunities, identifying 12 main risks and 7  main  opportunities  with  potential  consequences  for  its business  and  the  development  of  its  strategy.  This  mapping also  included  interviews  with  contributing  departments  and internal  experts  and  took  account  of  practice  at  our  peers. A variety of risks, including the impacts of climate change on the supply of key raw materials, carbon pricing, and the effects of  extreme  climatic  events  on  the  Group's  infrastructure as  well  as  those  linked  to  consumer  expectations,  were identified. This mapping gave rise to differentiated assessment approaches for the impact of risks and opportunities,  which  fed  into  the  review  of  policies  and strategic directions. Forming part of a process of continuous improvement,  this  research  also  identified  additional  action areas  for  strengthening  the  Group's  management  of  climate risks and prioritizing the action plans adopted.\n\nIn order to carry out an in-depth analysis and initial estimates of  their  potential  financial  impacts,  work  began  in  2021  and focused on three risks  and  three  opportunities,  published  in detail in Kering's 2022  response  to  the  CDP  Climate questionnaire.\n\nKering plans to manage climate-related risks and opportunities,  anticipating  their  effects  and  ensuring  its resilience  by  adapting  its  business  model,  governance  and decision-making processes, and  its supply chain. The evaluation  of  climate  risk  is  today  an  integral  part  of  Group risk  management  (see  section  1.3.3  and  Chapter  5  of  this document).",

Scope  2  accounted  for  26%  of emissions  relating  to  the  Group's  operations,  down  32% relative to 2021. Despite a reduction in natural gas consumption and in the related emissions, Scope 1 accounted for  a  larger  proportion  of  emissions  in  2022  than  in  2021, because  of  greater  use  of  company  cars.  After  two  years  in which  COVID-19  restrictions  limited  travel,  car  use  rose in 2022.\n\n## 5.2.2.3 Energy consumption indicators and programs to improve the energy efficiency of Kering's operations\n\nThe following indicators relate to the Group's energy consumption.\n\n## Energy consumption in 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( in MWh )\n\n|                                                         | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | Change 2022/2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| Electricity                                             | 285,056 | 254,325 | 226,280 | 12%                |\n| of which electricity from renewable sources             | 270,026 | 234,262 | 205,869 | 15%                |\n| Natural gas                                             | 56,493  | 63,403  | 49,029  | -11%               |\n| Heating oil                                             | 1,026   | 1,834   | 1,728   | -44%               |\n| Steam, heating, cooling                                 | 5,315   | 4,486   | 3,978   | 19%                |\n| LPG                                                     | 86      | 72      | 75      | 19%                |\n| Fuel for transportation and on-site handling            | 309     | 190     | 133     | 63%                |\n| Biomass                                                 | 754     | 860     | 618     | -12%               |\n| Other energy sources                                    | 607     | 638     | -       | -5%                |\n| TOTAL                                                   | 349,646 | 325,808 | 281,841 | 7%                 |\n| Energy intensity excluding industrial sites  (MWh/m 2 ) | 0.157   | 0.161   | 0.157   | -2%                |\n| Total energy pro forma scope                            | 299,380 | 297,620 | 264,667 | 1%                 |\n| of which electricity                                    | 239,393 | 231,285 | 212,500 | 4%                 |\n| of which electricity from renewable sources             | 227,819 | 213,258 | 192,891 | 7%                 |\n| of which natural gas                                    | 54,134  | 60,668  | 47,125  | - 11%              |\n\nPro forma figures are calculated taking into account open sites on a full-year basis for the three consecutive reporting years in question, i.e. 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n76%  of  the  Group's  energy  consumption  corresponds  to  the heating,  lighting  and  air  conditioning  of  stores,  warehouses and  offices.  Electricity  is  still  the  Group's  main  source  of power,  accounting  for  82%  of  consumption,  and  95%  of electricity is from renewable sources.\n\nIn 2022, annual energy consumption increased by around 7% overall,  mainly  because  of  a  12%  increase  in  electricity consumption.  This  resulted  from  the  large  number  of  site openings that took place in 2022, increasing the floorspace of the Group's sites by 12%.\n\nEnergy  sobriety  efforts  led  to  a  reduction  in  natural  gas consumption,  particularly  at  the  Group's  industrial  sites  and warehouses . In addition, the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources has continued to increase since 2020, in line with Kering's RE100 target - which it achieved in 2022 -  of  using  100%  renewable  electricity  in  all  countries  where that is possible (see box below).\n\n<!-- image -->",

All invoices, documents  and  data  from  sites  where  a  Kering  entity  has signed  an  energy  agreement  are  uploaded  to  an  easy-toaccess platform. The system covers Europe, the United States and Asia, and allows for:\n\n- \u00b7 streamlining  the  energy  procurement  process  by  pooling and consolidating energy consumption;\n- \u00b7 increasing the use of renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 centralizing energy procurement management;\n- \u00b7 improving analysis of energy consumption data;\n- \u00b7 more effective communication with energy companies and the authorities.\n\nThe project has resulted in tangible energy savings and lower costs for the Houses and the Group. The system has gradually evolved,  including  data  from  smart  meters  for  a  growing number of sites and extending the scope of application to not just electricity and gas but also, since 2021, to urban heating, urban cooling and water. Because of energy issues arising in 2022 (see below), efforts were made to put all sites in Europe and North America on the platform.\n\nSeveral Group sites have a submetering system. These systems are  installed  in  most  industrial  sites  and  in  almost  all  sites with LEED certification (or similar).\n\n## Minimizing energy use and measuring energy efficiency improvements\n\nThe Group takes two main types of measures to optimize the energy efficiency of its sites. Given the current energy crisis, a third  initiative  was  adopted  in  2022,  consisting  of  a  special energy-saving plan:\n\n## 1) Systematically obtaining recognized, high-level certification for new sites renovated by Kering.\n\nKering and its Houses are increasingly implementing certification  for  their  sites  and  stores.  Certification  is  sought for  new  sites  targeted  by  Kering's  Real  Estate  teams  from 2019.  US-based  LEED  (Gold  and  Platinum  level)  is  the preferred certification system selected by the Group, but other certifications,  like  HQE  (France)  and  BREEAM  (UK),  are  also sought  for  projects  where  they  are  particularly  relevant. Optimized energy performance, the use of renewable energies and other energy conservation criteria are critical to obtaining green  building  certifications.  In  2022,  Kering  also  obtained WELL  certification,  which  is  based  on  the  well-being  of building users, for certain projects for the first time.\n\nMore  than  130  LEED  certifications  had  been  obtained  by Kering and its Houses for their sites and stores by the end of 2022.  Around  50  further  certifications  -  almost  exclusively LEED - are in the process of being obtained.\n\n- \u00b7 At the end of 2022, 105 Gucci stores and three offices were LEED-certified, a sharp increase relative to 2021. Gucci has developed an action plan to extend LEED certification to all its  stores worldwide where applicable. Alexander McQueen is  actively  seeking  to  obtain  LEED  v4  Gold  or  Platinum\n\ncertification  for  its  new  concept  stores,  with  30  stores certified  by  the  end  of  2022.  Saint  Laurent  is  also continuing work to reduce the environmental impact of its stores  on  the  basis  of  its  Golden  Rules  to  make  its  stores more  energy  efficient.  The  House  has  27  LEED-certified stores,  of  which  21  have  achieved  Platinum  certification. Its  Paris  headquarters  has  BREEAM  'excellent'  and  HQE 'exceptional' certification. Balenciaga has 80 LEED-certified stores, which make up 50% of its eligible stores, and 12 of them have Platinum certification.\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga has set up a specialist leather goods production site  in  Cerreto  Guidi,  Italy,  which  is  currently  undergoing renovation. This process falls within the framework of LEED certification  for  production  facilities,  meeting  the  same requirements as LEED certification for stores. The Sustainability team and the operational team are involved in  monitoring  this  certification  process,  in  particular  by using  materials  obtained  from  recycling  its  own  scraps  or unsold items when refurbishing buildings, and particularly for sound insulation.\n\n## 2) Establishing a Group-wide standard for stores.\n\nKering has been working since 2017 to develop a 'Standard for Stores'  that  sets  out  expected  performance  levels  in  11  key areas. These include energy management, lighting, renewable energy,  water  use  and  waste  treatment.  The  Standards  cover all  phases  in  a  building's  lifecycle,  namely  site  selection  and relations  with  the  lessor,  design,  construction  or  renovation, and  operation.  After  a  test  phase  at  the  Group's  stores,  the standard  was  officially  published  in  2020  to  serve  as  a reference for new stores and store renovations where the use of  LEED  or  equivalent  certifications  is  not  possible.  In  2022, a  second  revision  of  the  standard  began,  with  the  aim  of making  it  more  effective  and  aligned  with  both  the  LEED protocol and the European taxonomy.\n\nThe main technical changes related to the shift to LED lighting and  continuing  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of  LED lighting, the adoption of systems for regulating light intensity, and the installation of building management systems (BMSs) in the most important sites.\n\nThrough these activities aimed at increasing energy efficiency, the  Group's  energy  consumption  has  improved  constantly since 2015 across all Group sites. Energy intensity has fallen by 17% for offices, 19% for industrial sites, 33% for stores and 42% for warehouses.\n\nLastly,  LED  lighting  -  which  delivers  energy  savings  of  up  to 90% - continued to be rolled out by all of the Group's Houses, with  close  to  100%  deployment  in  store  sales  areas,  where most  of  the  light  fittings  are  concentrated.  In  the  last  few years,  efforts  have  been  focused  on  introducing  LED  lighting into  store  backrooms,  offices,  warehouses  and  production plants. This practice is part of the Kering Standards and also a criterion  for  obtaining  environmental  certifications  such  as LEED,  BREEAM  and  HQE.  Some  Houses  are  also  gradually rolling  out  site  energy  consumption  management  tools (Building Management  System  for  Gucci's  main  stores, dedicated  system  at  Saint  Laurent)  at  stores  in  order  to monitor the main types of energy use and to make them more energy  efficient  (heating  and  air  conditioning,  ventilation, lighting, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## Focus on: Energy sobriety, adjusting to current energy issues\n\nGiven the energy issues that arose in winter 2022/23, the Kering group has adopted an energy-saving strategy aimed at reducing  energy  demand  by  15%  worldwide  (in  October-March  relative  to  winter  2021/22),  in  response  to  the  French government's appeal to reduce consumption by 10% in France. This energy sobriety plan is based on energy-saving plans adopted by all the Group's Houses and head office, which include:\n\n- \u00b7 regulating lighting, heating and air conditioning systems in order to reduce their use or turn them off when not required,\n- \u00b7 carrying out extraordinary maintenance on heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems,\n- \u00b7 reducing temperature settings for the heating of internal spaces and increasing temperature settings for cooling systems.\n\nOn a longer-term view, the Group is planning investment to continue improving energy efficiency at its production sites, as well as energy production, particularly by installing solar panels on its buildings.\n\n## Favoring renewable energy by producing it on-site or purchasing renewable energy certificates\n\nFor  many  years,  Kering  has  encouraged  the  signing  of agreements to purchase locally produced green electricity, for all  sites  that  pay  their  energy  bills  directly  and  whenever the\n\nlocal electricity market allows. For regions where this practice is not possible, Kering purchases Energy Attribute Certificates. In  addition,  to  speed  up  the  energy  transition  in  its  host countries, the Group only purchases certificates from solar or wind  power  production  facilities  that  are  new  or  relatively recent (less than ten years old) wherever possible.\n\n## Focus on: 100% renewable electricity in 2022 - RE100 target achieved by Kering\n\nIn 2020, the Group joined the RE100 initiative led by the Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). As part of this initiative, Kering has pledged to use 100% renewable electricity by 2022.\n\nThe  initiative,  which  was  updated  and  made  more  stringent  in  October  2022,  involves  obtaining  and  checking  the commitments  of  signatory  companies  by  following  strict  guidelines  on  how  they  meet  their  energy  needs:  renewable electricity may be self-produced on-site, obtained through a physical or virtual power purchase agreement, or purchased from  a  local  electricity  supplier  that  provides  adequate  evidence  of  renewable  claims;  or  bundled  or  unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) can be purchased in an amount that corresponds to the consumption of electricity produced in the same market as the one in which it is used.\n\nKering's  2022  electricity  consumption  was  fully  covered  by  renewable  energy  in  all  countries  where  that  was  possible (representing  95%  of  the  Group's  total  electricity  consumption).  In  2022,  Kering  either  self-produced  electricity,  used renewable energy from local suppliers or purchased EACs corresponding to its consumption in accordance with the RE100 guidelines. The remaining 5% corresponds to consumption in markets where it was not possible to purchase renewable electricity; South Korea accounts for 79% of consumption in those countries.\n\nAs a result, Kering achieved the RE100 target of using 100% renewable energy in accordance with the RE100 organization's guidelines.\n\nAs  regards  the  on-site  production  of  solar  energy,  Kering reached  an  important  milestone  in  July  2022  by  completing the  grid  connection  for  the  solar  photovoltaic  system  of  the Trecate distribution center, Italy's largest roof-mounted solar photovoltaic  system  (12.5  MW)  and  one  of  the  largest  in Europe. Self-produced solar electricity accounted for 2.4% of total energy consumption. At the end of 2022, Kering had solar photovoltaic systems on roofs and in car parks at around 20 sites.\n\nThe  Houses  are  also  increasing  the  proportion  of  their electricity coming from renewable energy generated and used on site.  This  is  being  achieved  particularly  by  installing  solar panels: for example at Bottega Veneta and also at Gucci, where 15%  of  the  energy  needs  of  its  two  Italian  head  offices  are covered by solar PV panels installed on-site.\n\nAside from solar power, one site - Saint Laurent's production site  in  Angers,  France  -  uses  wood  biomass  to  heat  the premises. Heat production is the only area in which Kering still\n\nuses  fossil  fuels:  it  accounted  for  17%  of  total  energy consumption  in  2022,  less  than  in  2021  in  line  with  the Group's efforts. Boilers are gradually being replaced by electric heat pumps powered by renewable electricity.\n\n## 5.2.2.4 Measuring and regulating the carbon footprint outside our operations\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions related to Kering's value chain and not  under  the  Group's  direct  control  (Scope  3)  amounted  to 2,398,466  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent  in  2022,  i.e.  99%  of total emissions. The Scope 3 categories covered according to the GHG Protocol are summarized in the table below (see the 2022 Methodological  Note  relating  to  the  EP&L,  available  on the Group's website).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Emissions related to purchased goods and services\n\nEmissions related to Kering's purchases of goods and services are calculated by the EP&L tool and cover all production and processing of raw materials that are used for the products and packaging of Group Houses (Tiers 3 and 4), the production of components and the assembly of sold products (Tiers 1 and 2),  and  third-party  distribution  activities  (wholesale  -  within Tier  0).  They  account  for  77%  of  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e. 1,852,771 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.\n\nKering's  aim  is  to  minimize  its  impact  on  the  Group's resources,  not  only  as  regards  its  carbon  footprint  but  by taking  into  account  all  indicators  measured  in  the  EP&L (air pollution, waste, water use, water pollution and land use). These  initiatives  are  presented  in  the  following  sections,  in connection with the Group's Biodiversity Strategy (section 5.3) and  its  Circularity  Ambition  (section  5.4),  from  the  raw materials sourcing phase onward (section 5.3.3).\n\n## 1) Commitment and initiatives involving our direct suppliers\n\nKering  contributes  to  the  implementation  of  projects  aiming to  reduce  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  suppliers,  as shown by the Clean By Design program. Spearheaded in 2013 by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), the Clean by Design  program  aims  to  reduce  the  environmental  footprint of  textile  manufacturers  through  the  organization  of  energy water  audits  reviewing  ten  key  points  of  a  production  site's performance.\n\nClean by Design has been implemented at the premises of 41 historic and strategic Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers located in Italy (dyeing, printing and finishing factories, spinning and weaving mills,  denim  laundries),  six  in  China  (three  wool  cleaning factories  and  three  silk  reeling  factories)  and  eight  in  Japan. Energy use has been reduced by 19% per site on average, with reductions mainly in the range of 10% to 20% but up to 40% in some  cases.  The  program  has  compelling  economic  appeal, since the payback period of efficiency initiatives for suppliers is less than 2.5 years in Italy and less than one year in China.\n\nIn 2021, Kering announced the extension of Clean by Design in Italy  with  the  Apparel  Impact  Institute  (Aii),  in  partnership with Stella McCartney and Burberry, and with the Legambiente non-profit  organization  as  a  local  partner.  This  multi-party partnership reflects Kering's desire to involve more suppliers and other brands in order to steer developments in the textile supply  chain  toward  increasingly  ambitious  sustainability objectives.  Eight  of  Brioni's  suppliers  and  three  of  its production plants joined the program in 2021.\n\n0.2%",

        "page_content": "In 2022, Kering also initiated the development of a \"zero emission\" program in the leather and apparel industries, based on :\n\n- \u00b7 continuous progress in energy efficiency (as an extension of the Clean By Design program);\n- \u00b7 the  gradual  phase  out  of  fossil  fuels  use  in  processes, replacing  fuel-fired  boilers  with  heat  pumps  or  other electrical systems;\n- \u00b7 maximizing the use of self-production of electricity on site.\n\nKering's logistics hub runs training sessions and awareness-raising  meetings  with  suppliers  and  in  particular with its logistics partners on (i) Kering's Climate Strategy, with most  freight  operators  now  providing  the  Group  with  CO2 reports  in  accordance  with  the  EN  16258  standard;  (ii) expectations  in  terms  of  environmental  performance  in  line with  the  Group's  ambitions  (reporting,  circularity,  single-use plastics,  carbon  footprint).  ISO  14001  certification  is  also  a contractual requirements for BtoB transportation providers.\n\nSome Houses such as Gucci have also made a commitment to their  suppliers to implement energy efficiency measures and use  green  energy.  Use  of  energy  from  renewable  sources amounted to 25% in Gucci's supply chain,  and  up  to  50%  in certain categories (leather production process, for example).\n\n## 2. Energy-related emissions not included in Scopes 1 and 2\n\nEnergy-related emissions not included in Scopes 1 and 2 are those related to the extraction, production and transportation of the fuel and energy purchased by Kering.\n\nIn  2022,  those  emissions,  which  derive  directly  from  the Group's energy consumption (see section 5.2.2), amounted to 38,232  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent,  i.e.  2%  of  Scope  3 emissions. Efforts to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions have a direct impact on this category.\n\n## 3. Transportation-related emissions\n\nCategories  4,  6  and  9  of  the  GHG  Protocol,  which  relate  to transportation, can be divided as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 upstream transportation (category 4 of the GHG Protocol): this  includes  all  transportation  of  goods  paid  for  by  the Houses or the Group between suppliers and logistics platforms or industrial sites, between central logistics platforms and local  distribution  centers  and  between  central  logistics platforms  or  local  distribution  centers  and  points  of  sale. The transportation of goods between logistics centers also falls  into  this  category.  Upstream  transportation  includes road,  rail,  sea  and  air  freight.  In  2022,  all  last-mile transportation - i.e. between local distribution centers and points of sale - was included, which was not the case in 2021. Similarly  inbound  goods  transportation  between  suppliers and logistics platforms or industrial sites, have been included.\n- \u00b7 Downstream transportation (category 9 of the GHG Protocol): this  covers  all  deliveries  of  finished  products  between logistics  platforms  or  points  of  sale  and  customers.  It excludes logistics flows (for Brioni, the Jewelry Houses and Kering Eyewear) that are not material at the Group level.\n- \u00b7 Business travel (category 6 of the GHG Protocol): this covers air travel.\n\nOutbound transportation  between  central  logistics  platforms and local distribution centers has been included in a monthly monitoring tool, which allows more detailed oversight during the  year.  Additional  work  was  done  in  2022  to  review transportation flows and the related emissions. As a result, all outbound  flows  as  far  as  points  of  sale  were  included,  and monitoring  was  improved  regarding  flows  between  suppliers and logistics platform and industrial sites. Where source data were missing, the related emissions were estimated.\n\nDetails  of  the  emission  factors  used  are  set  out  in  the methodological note on environmental reporting for 2022.\n\n## Emissions related to transportation and travel in 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( in metric tons of CO2 equivalent)\n\n|                           | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | Change 2022/2021   |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| Upstream transportation   | 199,431 | 163,188 | 120,151 | 22%                |\n| Downstream transportation | 44,311  | 73,078  | 4       | -39%               |\n| Business travel           | 15,565  | 5,881   | 6,781   | 165%               |\n| TOTAL                     | 259,307 | 242,147 | 126,936 | 7%                 |\n\n## Upstream transportation\n\nUpstream transportation accounts for 77% of transportation-related emissions. Kering uses road and air transportation to carry its  finished  products  and  merchandise  between  production  centers  and  logistics  platforms,  and  between  logistics  platforms and stores. Air transportation is only used for distant markets (Asia, Americas, Oceania).\n\n## Emissions related to upstream transportation by mode in 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( in metric tons of CO2 equivalent)\n\n|              | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | Change 2022/2021   |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| Road freight | 23,370  | 7,690   | 5,181   | 204%               |\n| Sea freight  | 1,232   | 1,018   | 300     | 21%                |\n| Air freight  | 174,802 | 154,405 | 114,664 | 13%                |\n| Rail freight | 27      | 75      | 6       | -64%               |\n| TOTAL        | 199,431 | 163,188 | 120,151 | 22%                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe increase in 2022 relative to 2021 was mainly due to new logistics flows (last-mile and inbound road transportation, as described  above)  being  included  in  the  calculation  of  the Group's  footprint.  On  a  comparable  basis,  the  increase  in transportation  volumes  (because  of  the  Group's  business growth in 2022) mainly concerns road transportation, whereas air transportation was stable.\n\n## Downstream transportation\n\nFollowing  on  from  changes  made  in  2021,  Kering  included transportation to customers in relation to e-commerce sales. E-commerce  transportation  flows  taken  into  account  in  the carbon impact of transportation in 2022 cover almost all flows (except  for  non-material  flows  at  Brioni  and  those  of  the Jewelry Houses and Kering Eyewear).\n\n## Emissions related to downstream transportation by mode in 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( in metric tons of CO2 equivalent)\n\n|              | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | Change 2022/2021   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Road freight | 2,424  | 2,627  | 4      | -8%                |\n| Air freight  | 41,887 | 70,451 | -      | -41%               |\n| TOTAL        | 44,311 | 73,078 | 4      | -39%               |\n\nThe reduction in emissions from air freight between 2021 and 2022  was  due  to  methodological  adjustments  in  2022  that made it possible to calculate emissions precisely, along with a 27%  reduction  in  the  volume  of  goods  transported  by  air (in  metric  ton-km),  whereas  the  volume  transported  by  road (in metric ton-km) rose by 36%.\n\n## Optimizing logistics flows and switching to alternative means of transportation\n\nGoods  transportation  accounts  for  a  large  proportion  of  the Group's CO2 emissions, which is why Kering works closely with its logistics platforms, its Houses and its carriers to reduce the distances  covered  during  supply  and  delivery,  to  optimize truck  and  aircraft  load  factors  and  the  environmental  and technical  performance  of  truck  fleets,  and  to  develop alternative  means  of  transportation  aimed  at  reducing  the Group's carbon footprint.\n\nSince 2019, Kering's Logistics Division has focused on identifying potential  areas  of  improvement  in  terms  of  measurement and monitoring and on initiatives to be implemented to reduce the  environmental  impact  of  transportation.  Projects  to  adapt Kering's logistics organization have enabled it to put\n\nenvironmental  concerns  at  the  heart  of  what  it  does. For example, it gives preference to the most efficient vehicles and  aircraft,  with  very  ambitious  CO2  emissions  standards (maximum of 600g of CO2per metric ton-km for air freight, the EURO 6 standard for road freight) and is making increasing use of  alternative  modes  of  transport  for  last-mile  logistics. Renewing contracts  with  freight  operators  has  also  provided the  opportunity  to  share  Kering's  high  reporting  standards. Each  month,  Kering  collects  data  on  the  carbon  footprint  of activities carried out for the Group by each of its main freight operators  in  accordance  with  the  EN  16258  global  standard. Finally,  in  line  with  its  SBT  1.5\u00b0C  target  for  reducing  carbon emissions  by  2030,  Kering  plans  to  define  carbon  reduction trajectories  compatible  with  its  SBT  target  in  collaboration with its main freight operators.\n\nIn 2022, Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Kering Eyewear introduced measures to optimize BtoB transportation (itineraries,  loads, functional design, reverse logistics) and various stages of the supply  chain  through  to  stores.  Kering's  logistics  teams continued to work actively in partnership with the Houses to optimize packaging, which is another key driver of improvements in the Group's environmental footprint.\n\n## Business travel\n\n## CO2 emissions related to business travel by air in 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in metric tons of CO 2 equivalent)\n\n|                     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | Change 2019/2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Business air travel | 15,565 | 5,881  | 6,781  | 32,181 | -52%               |\n\nAfter two years of COVID-related restrictions, which particularly affected  international  air  travel,  business  travel  resumed  in 2022.  This  led  to  an  increase  in  associated  CO2  emissions relative  to  2021  although  they  were  still  52%  lower  than  in 2019  because  of  remote  working  agreements  and  the widespread use of digital events.\n\nIn addition, the Group's Houses  are  also developing alternatives  to  reduce  business  travel  and  encouraging employees  to  use  public  transport  and  green  modes  of transport, as well as car pooling.\n\nSince  2021,  Gucci  has  been  offering  a  car  pooling  service  at some  of  its  sites  in  Italy,  which  can  also  be  used  outside working hours. Balenciaga also has a car pooling service at its production site in Cerreto Guidi, Italy.\n\nUse of bicycles is also encouraged, whether by creating bicycle parking facilities (Boucheron, Balenciaga and Kering Corporate)  or  by  setting  up  a  fleet  of  electric  bicycles  for employees at Saint Laurent's Paris head office to use free of charge, as well as for logistics teams.\n\nThe Group also applies environmental criteria when selecting company  cars  and  is  gradually  increasing  the  number  of electric  vehicles  in  its  fleet.  As  part  of  this  effort,  Pomellato, Dodo, Kering Eyewear, Saint Laurent and Kering Corporate are including hybrid and electric vehicles in their fleets. At the end of 2022, these vehicles accounted for 49% of the vehicle fleet at Gucci, 46% at Bottega Veneta and 65% at Balenciaga.",

Emissions related to the use of sold products and their end-of-life treatment\n\nEmissions related to the use of sold products and their endof-life  treatment  together  account  for  10%  of  the  Group's Scope 3 emissions according to the GHG Protocol, amounting to 244,112  and  4,044  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent respectively.\n\nSections  5.4-6.1  of  this  document  contain  a  detailed description of Kering's initiatives to reduce the impact of these categories and influence consumers.\n\n## 5.2.2.5 Contribution to climate change mitigation\n\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions is the first priority of the Group's climate strategy. In addition to the Group's reduction targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative ,  Kering has  since  2012  been  investing  in  nature-based  carbon offsetting  projects,  thereby  helping  to  protect  essential ecosystems and carbon sinks around the world. These projects help  to  mitigate  climate  change  beyond  the  Group's  value chains  and  to  preserve  and  restore  sensitive  ecosystems (forests, wetlands and coastal areas).\n\nEach year, the volume of carbon credits corresponds to all of the direct and indirect emissions of the Group and its supply chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 as measured via the EP&L, excluding use and end-of-life of sold products). In 2022, with respect to 2021,  Kering  offset  its  entire  carbon  footprint  of  2,143,465 metric tons of CO2 via certified nature-based projects. 11% of credits came from projects that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (commonly called ' removal projects ') and 89% came  from  projects  that  avoid  greenhouse  gas  emission (' avoidance projects '). This includes REDD+ programs aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and ecosystem degradation,  which  are  certified  and  verified  according  to international standards such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or Gold Standard.\n\nAll  projects  supported  by  Kering  help  to  mitigate  climate change  (by  avoiding  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and/or capturing carbon) and include positive impacts on biodiversity and  local  communities,  certified  by  the Climate,  Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) and/or by SD VISta ( Sustainable Development  Verified  Impact  Standard ). Kering  plans  to increase  gradually  its  support  for  carbon  removal  projects relative to avoidance projects, as recommended by SBTi.\n\nKering is also continuing to diversify and step up its efforts to help mitigate climate change beyond its own supply chains, in two main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Support for targeted projects that use emerging techniques in key landscapes for the Group's activities, in areas where key  raw  materials  to  the  fashion  industry  are  produced. Since 2020, for example, Kering has invested in Low Carbon Label ( Label Bas Carbone )  certified  projects,  in  partnership with  IDELE  ( Institut  de  l'\u00c9levage , the  French  Livestock Institute), which support French cattle breeders in developing more climate-friendly practices. In 2022, Kering also  made  a  commitment  to  the  linen  industry  in  France with  regenerative  agriculture  projects  coordinated  by Sysfarm.\n- \u00b7 Climate  Fund  for  Nature:  this  fund,  announced  during COP15 in late 2022, was initiated by Kering and is managed by Mirova, a Natixis subsidiary specializing in environmental and  social  impact  investing.  It  invests  in  projects  in  key regions for the production of critical raw materials for the fashion and beauty industries. This fund is also supported by L'OCCITANE Group, and has already attracted \u20ac140 million of investments. It is open to other participants in the fashion  and  beauty  industries,  and  has  an investment target of  \u20ac300  million.  The  fund  is  supporting new projects involving high-quality nature-based solutions that  generate  carbon  credits  for  Kering  and    other co-investors.  Around  two  thirds  are  removal  projects  and one  third  avoidance  projects.  The  fund  aims  to  reach  a contribution  of    10  million  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent over  15  years  and  to  deliver  additional  benefits  for communities,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  promoting women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## Focus on: Gucci's climate solutions portfolio\n\nSince  2020,  Gucci  has  been  developing  its  positive  approach  for  nature  by  directly  transforming  its  own  supply  chain through the use of regenerative agriculture, and particularly via its Natural Climate Solutions Portfolio. In 2022, the House maintained its support programs to protect and restore nature through REDD+ offsetting projects. These projects help to combat climate change while also having a positive economic and social impact on local communities, as well as protecting flora  and  fauna.  This  includes  protecting  undisturbed  land  by  means  of  'green  carbon'  offsetting  projects  and  restoring forests  and  wetlands  -  mainly  mangroves  -  through  'blue  carbon'  projects,  which  are  particularly  effective  for  carbon sequestration and storage. Gucci supports a number of regenerative agriculture projects in Italy and worldwide, and the materials they produce will feature in Gucci's upcoming collections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  raw  materials  come  from farms,  rangelands,  forests  and  mines.  With  supply  chains spread around the world - for example wool in New Zealand and  South  Africa,  cashmere  in  Mongolia,  organic  cotton  in India  and  Turkey  etc.  -  Kering  is  particularly  attentive  to  the preservation and healthy functionning of natural ecosystems.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  published  its  Biodiversity  Strategy,  which aims to stem the loss of biodiversity, restore ecosystems, and protect  the  species  composing  them,  as  well  as  to  drive systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond. Kering is committed to contributing to a net positive (1) impact on biodiversity by 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering  has  structured  its  activities  around  four  phases: avoidance, reduction, restoration/regeneration and transformation. Kering is applying this conservation hierarchy  as  recommended  by  the  Science  Based  Targets Network (SBTN), to  create  a  nature-positive  trajectory  and to  develop  scientific  methods  for  ensuring  that  human activities respect planetary boundaries;\n- \u00b7 Kering has made quantitative commitments for 2025:\n- - by 2025, Kering will support a transition to regenerative agricultural practices across one million hectares of land in  key  production  landscapes  of  some  of  the  main  raw\n\nmaterials  forming  part  of  Kering's  supply  chain,  such  as leather, cotton, wool or cashmere. To achieve this, Kering has partnered with the environmental NGO Conservation International to create the Regenerative Fund for Nature. The Fund supports projects that are transforming farming and breeding practices in areas that supply raw materials to the fashion industry,\n\n- - by  2025,  Kering  will  protect  one  million  hectares  of critical  and  irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply chain, through programs that deliver positive impact for biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local communities.\n\nThese  two  million  hectares  represent  more  than  six  times the global footprint of Kering's direct and indirect (supply  chain)  operations,  which  was  calculated  by  the  EP&L as  350,000  hectares  in  2020.  Kering  has  therefore  included a  significant  security  margin  in  its  efforts  to  have  a  net positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nThrough  its  Biodiversity  Strategy,  Kering  has  since  2020 committed to reducing its negative impact on biodiversity and to increasing its positive impact, in line with target 15 of the Global Biodiversity Framework  agreed during the UN Biodiversity  Conference  (COP15)  in  Montreal  in  2022.  This includes  regularly  reporting,  assessing  and  transparently disclosing  biodiversity  risks,  dependencies  and  impacts, particularly through its EP&L, across all of its operations and supply  chains.  The  Group  is  also  aligned  with  target  19 regarding increasing the level of financial resources for nature conservation and restoration, via the Climate Fund for Nature.\n\n- 232",

In  line  with  this,  Kering  joined  the  corporate  engagement program of the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) in 2020 and has played an active role in shaping the guidance for all stakeholders  and  in  the  implementation  of  actions.  The program  will  provide  the  SBTN  with  strategic  insights  into cutting-edge  science  and  approaches,  as  well  as  providing  a forum  for  sharing  best  practice  and  experience  with  other groups and coalitions. In turn, this allows Kering to continue to  refine  its  objectives  based  on  the  best  available  scientific data.\n\nAfter a series of consultations, the SBTN intends to publish an initial version of its Science Based Targets (SBT) for nature in early 2023. Kering has undertaken to follow these recommendations, to continue helping to improve them and to encourage their use as widely as possible.\n\nKering  is  also  a  member  of  the  stakeholder  forum  of  the Taskforce  for  Nature-Related  Financial  Disclosures (TNFD), whose  final  recommendations  should  be  published  in September 2023.\n\n## 5.3.2 Responsible land use and protection of biodiversity\n\nFirmly believing that businesses have a decisive role to play in the  face  of  the  biodiversity  loss  observed  by  scientists,  and that  there  is  a  link  between  the  preservation  of  ecosystems and  the  sustainability  of  its  economic  activity,  Kering  has made  protecting  biodiversity  a  key  aspect  of  its  strategy.\n\nAs a player in the luxury sector, the nature of its products and the  corresponding  quality  requirements  make  the  Group heavily dependent on natural raw materials (wool, cashmere, leather,  cotton,  silk,  etc.)  and  on  the  ecosystems  these materials originate from. Climate change, soil degradation and the loss of natural habitats are already disrupting ecosystems, so  it  is  essential  to  make  them  more  resilient.  These biodiversity-rich natural ecosystems provide essential services to our societies, such as climate regulation, soil regeneration, water  filtration  and  the  availability  of  raw  materials  for Kering's activities, but also for food, medicine and construction.\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Measurement of ecosystem services and biodiversity and focus on key geographic regions\n\nThe 'land use' part of the EP&L makes it possible to estimate how raw materials used by the Group affect the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity. The methodology adopted  for  this  indicator  establishes  an  ecosystem  service reference  value  for  virgin  biomes  based  on  (1)  species richness,  (2)  above-ground  biomass  and  (3)  soil  organic carbon  (SOC)  as  substitution  parameters.  These  parameters are applied to the Group's activities, depending on the types of soil  use  and  geographic  regions.  Kering  is  committed  to improving the allowance made for biodiversity and ecosystem services  in  its  EP&L  methodology,  for  example  by  making  it possible  to  factor  in  estimates  of  changes  in  Mean  Species Abundance  as  an  additional  measure.  The  EP&L  results therefore  enable  a  more  advanced  understanding  of  the geographic  regions  in  which  the  Group's  efforts  should  be focused.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  first  seven projects  selected  in  2021  were  therefore  located  in  priority geographic regions resulting from this assessment.\n\nThe Group has been supporting nature conservation, restoration and regeneration programs in some of these biodiversity hotspots for several years prior to the launch of the Fund, including:\n\n- \u00b7 a full reforestation program for mining sites in the Amazon rainforest,  implemented  in  partnership  with  Solicaz  and ReforestFinance;\n- \u00b7 a  soil  regeneration  and  species  protection  program  in  the South Gobi desert in partnership with Wildlife Conservation International  (now  continued  as  part  of  the  Regenerative Fund  for  Nature  in  partnership  with  the  Good  Growth Company);\n- \u00b7 support  for  the  Karoo  Lamb  Consortium's  efforts  to preserve the heritage of biodiversity in the Karoo region.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Actions guided by the conservation hierarchy\n\nKering applies the SBTN's hierarchy: Avoid, Reduce, Restore & Regenerate, Transform.\n\n## 1. Avoid\n\nAs a priority, the Houses avoid sourcing materials with known material negative impacts on the environment, particularly in areas  of  critical  ecological  importance.  As  specified  in  the Kering Standards, this includes ensuring that all raw materials sourced do not cause deforestation or the conversion of other non-forest  natural  ecosystems,  as  well  as  ensuring  that materials  adhere  closely  to  the  guidelines  published  within the framework of CITES.\n\n## 2. Reduce\n\nWhen  impacts  cannot  be  entirely  avoided,  Kering  and  its Houses strive to reduce negative impacts on the environment by sourcing materials from preferred sources as defined in the Kering  Standards.  These  standards  list  recommended  thirdparty certifications in the Group's supply chains that guarantee low-impact agricultural practices, such as organic farming. In 2022,  71%  of  raw  materials  were  aligned  with  the  Kering Standards. The goal is to reach 100% by 2025.\n\n## 3. Restore & Regenerate\n\nIn addition to avoiding negative impacts, Kering aims to bring about  a  paradigm  shift  by  restoring  and  regenerating ecosystems. The Regenerative Fund for Nature aims to convert one  million  hectares  of  farms  and  rangelands  in  landscapes where  key  raw  materials  are  produced  to  regenerative agricultural  practices  by  2025.  The  first  seven  projects  were selected  in  2021  across  various  critical  sourcing  landscapes: cotton  (India),  leather  (Argentina,  France  and  Spain),  wool (Argentina and South Africa) and cashmere (Mongolia). Each of these  projects  has  a  monitoring  framework  to  assess  the impact on soil health (including improved soil organic carbon sequestration), biodiversity, the elimination of synthetic input usages,  improved  livelihoods  for  local  communities  and animal  welfare.  The  measurement  methods  and  indicators used  -  proposed  by  the  project  owners  with  technical  and scientific  support  from  Conservation  International -  vary according  to  the  geographic  region  so  that  they  can  be adjusted to the local context. At an aggregated, portfolio level, Kering measures  the  number  of  hectares  over  which regenerative  practices  are  being  implemented  thanks  to  the Fund's support - with a target of 1 million hectares by 2025 and  the  number  of  beneficiaries.  These  projects  represent  a total of 840,000 hectares that will eventually be converted into regenerative  agricultural  spaces  and  involve  60,000  people across the globe.\n\n## Focus on: the Epiterre project\n\nOne  of  the  projects  supported  by  the  Fund  and  implemented  in  the  Lot  region  of  France  by  the  NGO  Epiterre  involves agreements to pay for ecosystem services resulting from action taken by participating farmers. The project is taking place in a  region  well  known  for  sheep  farming  and  aims  to  support  the  planting  of  200  hectares  of  sainfoin,  a  local  species  of legume that helps to fix nitrogen in the soil, provides sustainable and nutritious feed for the sheep, and is a rich source of pollen for bees and other pollinating insects. The project also includes installing new beehives in order to provide further support to pollinators. These efforts are helping to strengthen an ancestral, traditional and sustainable local activity that is now making a comeback. They are also promoting the improvement of ecosystem services including protecting soils against the  risk  of  erosion  and  extreme  weather  events,  helping  farms  remain  productive  in  the  decades  to  come,  supporting pollination and increasing carbon sequestration in the soil.",

Ahead of COP 15, OP2B published a new framework for ecosystem restoration projects led  or supported by companies, including definitions, principles, examples of impact indicators and member  case studies. This framework complements the OP2B's Framework for Regenerative Agriculture published  in 2021, and in particular aims to achieve greater harmonization in this area. |\n| International                                 | The IPI is a coalition of companies seeking to support efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Platform for  Insetting (IPI)                 | biodiversity in local communities in the regions from which they source raw materials.

Among other things, this involves establishing political support and  capacity-building activities, developing new knowledge, carrying out awareness-raising initiatives  and providing assessments performed by scientific experts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| The Fashion Pact                              | Kering is an active member of the Biodiversity Pillar of the Fashion Pact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## 2) Positive contribution for climate and biodiversity beyond Kering's supply chains\n\nAlongside  efforts  to  decarbonize  its  supply  chains,  Kering  is contributing  to  global  climate  change  mitigation  beyond  its supply  chains  at  a  scale  equivalent  to  its  carbon  footprint (Scopes  1,  2  and  3  calculated  via  the  EP&L  tool  -  excluding product  use  and  end-of-life)  by  funding  nature-based solutions.  Such  projects  are  supported  in  particular  by  the Climate  Fund  for  Nature,  which  was  set  up  in  2022  (see section 5.2.2.5).\n\nOutside  of  its  supply  chain,  Kering  will  protect  an  additional one  million  hectares  of  critical  and  irreplaceable  habitats through  programs  that  deliver  benefits  for  biodiversity protection,  avoidance  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  arising from deforestation and from ecosystem degradation, increased carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local communities.\n\nThe Houses are also taking action within their supply chains (see next section), as well as through conservation initiatives that they carry in their own name (see section 6.3.2).\n\n## 5.3.3 Sustainable sourcing and use of raw materials (Tier 3 and Tier 4)\n\n## 5.3.3.1 Traceability and transformation of raw material production practices\n\nThe  Group's  EP&L  clearly  shows  that  most  environmental impacts (86%) are located upstream of its supply chains (Tier 1 to  Tier  4)  during  the  production  of  raw  materials  and  their initial transformation (Tiers 3 and 4, 70%). For Kering, critical impacts  are  generated  by  the  raw  materials  used  in  large quantities  and  whose  production  can  have  a  significant impact  on  the  environment,  such  as  leather,  or  by  raw materials used in smaller quantities but whose extraction or production  can  have  a  major  impact.  This  is  the  case  for animal fibers  such  as  cashmere  and  wool,  as  well  as  metals (such as gold and brass).\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  instance,  the  impact  of  leather  products and textile fibers of animal origin mainly concerns greenhouse gas  emissions  and  land  use  (and  the  potential  loss  of ecosystem  services).  The  use  of  metals,  especially  precious metals, has a significant impact on water pollution because of the  chemicals  used  in  extraction  and  the  early  stages  of  the refining process.\n\nBy analyzing the impact of each material, Kering can prioritize and focus efforts on the raw materials and supply chains that generate the greatest impact:\n\n- \u00b7 raw  materials  used  in  large  quantities  and  whose production can have a significant impact on the environment, such as leather;\n- \u00b7 raw  materials  used  in  smaller  quantities  but  whose extraction  or  production  has  a  major  impact.  This  is  the case for animal fibers such as wool and cashmere, as well as metals (such as gold and brass).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50\n\nKering has committed to reducing its environmental footprint, starting with the production of its raw materials. To this end, the  Smart  Sourcing  program,  launched  in  2013,  provides recommendations  and  guidance  for  the  Houses,  allowing them to use raw materials that are produced sustainably and responsibly.  This  project  draws  on  the  Kering  Standards  and relies  on  close  collaboration  between  the  Group  and  its Houses,  bringing  together  the  Material  Innovation  Lab  and supply  chain,  R&D  and  Sustainability  teams,  with  the  aim  of adopting  new  responsible  sourcing  solutions  suited  to  the specific needs of each House.\n\nThe Kering Standards lay down the Group's requirements for the  raw  materials  used  by  the  Houses  (see  section  4.1.1)  in particular  in  terms  of  traceability.  The  overall  level  of traceability of raw materials is consolidated annually through the  EP&L  tool  through  the  collection  of  information  on purchasing volumes. The level of traceability required by type of material was set on the basis of a risk matrix for each type of raw material, as well as the level of transparency achievable by the market. The origin of the raw materials is established\n\nby  supplier  declarations,  and  may  be  supplemented  by specific  protocols  including  certification  (such  as  ICEC  for leather) and verification by the Houses. In addition to audits, the Houses are investigating various technologies to trace the path from the extraction of raw materials to the intermediate production  stages  and  then  into  their  own  operations  and finally  into  stores.  These  technologies  include  RFID  and  NFC chips, blockchain, mechanical marking of hides, and forensic technology.\n\nKering has undertaken to:\n\n- \u00b7 achieve 100% traceability by 2025, at least to the country of origin  and  beyond  (potentially  to  the  farm)  for  certain materials  (as  specified  in  the  Kering  Standards  for  each material).\n- \u00b7 achieve 100% alignment with the Kering Standards by 2025, which  is  reflected  by  concrete  targets  for  most  raw materials.  More  specifically,  in  2022  Kering  achieved  the following  levels  of  traceability  and  alignment  with  the Kering Standards:",

Several Houses  (Gucci, Balenciaga,  Bottega  Veneta,  Saint  Laurent)  are  testing  and developing  technologies  to  trace  leather  at  each  stage  of production,  in  particular  to  avoid  losing  track  at  the slaughterhouse, which is the most sensitive link in the chain.\n\nIn terms of animal welfare, Kering published its Standards for all  animal  species  present  in  its  supply  chains  in  2019,  also releasing standards specifically targeting calves, cattle, sheep and goats, which account for a sizable proportion of leather supplies.  The  Standards  were  published  alongside  specific practical guidelines for slaughterhouses (see section 5.3.4). In 2021, Kering updated its map of food labels that meet a level\n\nequivalent  to  its  Standards  in  terms  of  animal  welfare  and environmental  protection,  both  at  the  farm  and  in  the slaughterhouse.  The  chosen  approach  draws  on  existing standards in the food industry and creates links between the leather  and  meat  supply  chains.  To  date,  16  standards  have been identified in close to 40 countries around the world.\n\nIn  2022,  around 10 physical audits were performed to check compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards  at  slaughterhouses level.\n\nIn  the  last  five  years,  an  internal  working  group  dedicated to responsible leather has brought together representatives from all the Group's leather-using Houses to join forces in this area. In  2022,  work  focused  on  transparency  and  traceability, animal  welfare  and  regenerative  agriculture  within  leather supply chains.\n\nSaint Laurent began a traceability project involving its Italian tanneries,  which  Balenciaga  later  joined  as  well.  This  project aims  to  improve  information  collected  about  their  supplies (countries,  slaughterhouses,  breeding  regions)  and  their practices,  in  particular  regarding  the  use  of  certification  or independent third party evaluations.\n\nIn 2022, Kering continued its collaborations to promote more responsible practices:\n\n| Initiatives                                                                | Presentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2022 results                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Paris Good Fashion                                                         | Since 2019, alongside the National Leather Council  (CNC), Kering ha sbeen co-leading a working group  on animal welfare bringing together several major  players in the French fashion and luxury sector  to accelerate the verification and improvement of  practices with participants in the agri-food and meat  industries, which have common supply chains. | Publication of a study on the link between the quality of skins and animal welfare.                                                                                                                                |\n| ' Cuir de Veau Fran\u00e7ais  Responsable '  (responsible French  calf leather) | Kering is collaborating with other luxury brands to  adopt harmonised animal welfare verification audits  and deploy them across the calf leather industry  in France, in collaboration with key stakeholders  in the veal industry (farmers, integrators,  slaughterhouses) This approach will enable participants to share ways                                 | Joint development and validation of  a common audit protocol with veterinary  experts and Idele (French farming institute) Pilot audits of 50 farms by a third party  Intended to be rolled out nationally by 2025 |\n| Textile Exchange -  Responsible Leather  Roundtable                        | Promoting leather certification: since 2017, as part  of Textile Exchange's responsible Leather Roundtable, Kering has contributed to the development of a  benchmark for certifications in leather supply chains  and to the  implementation of a mechanism for  rewarding the most virtuous players in terms of  animal welfare and environmental impact.       | LWG or ICEC ( Istituto di Certificazione della  Qualit\u00e0 per l'Industria Conciaria)  certification  in Italy for tanneries working with the Group's  Houses (Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Balenciaga,  Saint Laurent)     |",

        "page_content": "## Chrome-free and metal-free tanning\n\nMetal-free  tanning  techniques  are  also  a  major  focus  of Kering's  work  on  leather.  Since  2017,  the  Group  has  been working  closely  with  its  tanneries,  as  well  as  its  Houses  and their suppliers, to promote the use of leather tanned without metals in the following ways:\n\n- 1. Development of chrome- and metal-free tanning in all of the  Group's  tanneries  by  means  of  R&D  activities  in tanneries,  with  the  aim  of  testing  articles  made  from leather  tanned  without  metals  and  then  putting  such metal-free tanned items into production;\n- 2. Close collaboration with tanneries to develop new metalfree  tanned  items  and  gradually  increase  the  metal-free proportion  of  their  products.  Significant  progress  has been  made,  and  a  growing  number  of  tanneries  have started  to  convert  their  facilities  to  fully  metal-free production. Tanneries have been  invited to share information,  via  the  supplier  portal,  about  their  tanning methods and certifications.\n- 3. Increase  in  the  proportion  of  metal-free  tanning  in  the collections  of  the  Houses:  in  2022,  50%  of  volumes purchased by the Houses for leather goods were metal- or chrome-free. In 2016, Kering extended metal-free tanning to  crocodile  skins,  including  those  used  for  watchbands designed by its France Croco tannery.\n\n## Traceability and optimization of materials\n\nThe  efforts  on  traceability,  optimization  of  materials  and animal  welfare  in  the  leather  industry  have  delivered significant improvements for the Houses, in keeping with the Group's circularity policy (see section 5.4):\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci traces each batch of leather back to the slaughterhouse and/or farm and ensures that the country of supply complies with the requirements laid down in the Kering Standards. In 2022, supplier data shows that 99% of leather  was  traced  back  to  the  slaughterhouse.  Gucci improved  its  data  collection  processes  and  continued  to carry out traceability audits at tanneries.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga also increased the proportion of leather traced back to the slaughterhouse to 83% by the end of 2022;\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  Alexander  McQueen  continued  its  collaboration with  Oritain  and  its  suppliers  and  tanneries  to  trace  the supply of leather used in its leather goods and shoes;\n- \u00b7 at  the  end  of  2022,  95%  of  Bottega  Veneta's  leather  was traceable back to the country of origin.\n- \u00b7 Brioni  introduced  into  its  Spring/Summer  2022  and  Fall/ Winter 2022 collections a selection of shoe models made using metal-free leathers.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  has  developed  a  set  of  specific  KPIs  for  its supplier  evaluation  system  in  its  leather  tanneries.  Since 2019,  drawing  on  extensive  data  collection  across  all product  categories,  the  House  has  been  able  to  calculate and  monitor  levels  of  traceability,  percentages  of  Kering Standards-aligned  leather  purchases  and  tanneries'  EP&L performance on a monthly basis. The results feed into the supplier evaluation process.\n\nSeveral Houses have also set up systems with their suppliers for  collecting  and  recycling  scrap  leather,  following  the example  of  Saint  Laurent  and  subsequently  Balenciaga: Balenciaga's internal cutting center and two of its manufacturers  have  recycled  and  recovered  several  metric tons  of  scrap  leather  with  a  partner  that  converts  them  into reinforcing  patches  used  in  the  production  of  leather  goods. Balenciaga  also  works  with  Authentic  Materials  to  reuse leather  scraps  for  purposes  such  as  reinforcements  for  bag handles.  Since  2013,  Bottega  Veneta  has  installed  a  leather scrap management system, which enables scraps to be reused as fertilizer after removing chromium residues. In 2022, over 230  metric  tons  (80%)  of  leather  scraps  were  collected  and processed  thanks  to  this  project,  carried  out  in  cooperation with ILSA and Waste Recycling, two companies specializing in the collection and treatment of production scraps.\n\nLastly,  the  Group's  strategy  on  the  management  of  leather sourcing  in  relation  to  deforestation  is  made  public  and described  in  Kering's  responses  to  the  CDP  Forests  2022 Questionnaire, available on Kering's website and at www.cdp.net. It sets out the Group's governance with respect to cattle, risk management, objectives and performance.\n\n## 5.3.3.3 Cotton and plant textile fibers\n\n|        | 2022 traceability rate   | Level of traceability         | Rate of alignment with  the 2022 Kering Standards   |\n|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Cotton | 94%                      | Back to the country of origin | 72%                                                 |\n\nFor  environmental  and  social  reasons,  Kering  is  strongly committed  to  using  certified  recycled  or  traceable,  organic and  sustainably  grown  cotton,  and  to  encouraging  the transition to regenerative cotton production.\n\nAs  well  as  organic  farming,  through  which  cotton  is  grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, a fundamental part of Kering's approach is to support the widespread adoption of regenerative  practices  in  cotton  production.  The  aim  is  to\n\nprotect  and  restore  biodiversity  (soil  biodiversity,  as  well  as the  diversity  of  plant  and  animal  species,  both  inside  and outside  farms),  encourage  measurable  improvements  in  soil quality  (such  as  the  soil's  ability  to  retain  water  and  to sequester  carbon,  which  can  be  improved  by  maintaining plant  cover  year-round  on  farmed  land,  using  crop  rotations and minimizing soil disturbance for example) and ensure that farmers receive fair remuneration for adopting these regenerative practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nKering takes a multi-level approach to responsible cotton:\n\n## 1. Define and maintain high standards of sourcing\n\nThe standards set out by Kering on cotton specify traceability at least back to the country of origin (to avoid sourcing from countries  that  are  high-risk  in  terms  of  both  environmental and  social  impacts)  and  prohibit  the  use  of  chemicals  and pesticides.  Alignment  with  the  Kering  Standards  by  2025 includes a 100% organic cotton target. Kering encourages the use of organic cotton through its preference for GOTS (Global Organic  Textile  Standard)  and  OCS  100  (Organic  Content Standard)  certifications,  and  for  regenerative  practices,  for example through ROC (Regenerative Organic Certified) and EoV (Ecological Outcomes Verified) certifications.\n\n## 2. Encourage Houses the increase the proportion of cotton sourced from organic and regenerative farming\n\nIn  2022,  almost  half  of  the  cotton  used  by  the  Houses  was organic (49%) and 24% was certified recycled.\n\nFor  example,  in  2022  organic  cotton  accounted  for  72%  of cotton used  by  Bottega  Veneta  for  its  ready-to-wear collections.  In  2021,  the  House  also  began  using  recycled cotton  for  certain  leather  goods  items.  In  2022,  32%  of  the cotton  used  by  Gucci  was  organic,  while  84%  of  the  total volume  of  cotton  purchased  by  Saint  Laurent  and  73%  of Balenciaga's  production  (excluding  packaging)  were  GOTScertified.\n\nAs well as committing to organic cotton, Kering also continued to  make  progress  toward  sourcing  cotton  from  regenerative agriculture in the medium term, for example by supporting the project led by OCA (Organic Cotton Accelerator) in India as part of the Regenerative Fund for Nature, but also via other cotton projects in other geographical regions (including ones working more closely with direct suppliers of the Group's Houses, e.g. in  Italy,  Spain,  Greece  and  Turkey).  Most  of  these  projects involve  ROC  (Regenerative  Organic  Certified)  or  regenagri certification.\n\n## 3. Collaborate with other players in the sector to promote cotton from organic and regenerative farming and to attract investors\n\nAs a founding member of the Organic Cotton Accelerator (OCA) alongside Textile Exchange and other brands, Kering continued its support for the development of organic cotton farming  and  the  market  for  organic  cotton,  and  for  the adoption  of  regenerative  practices  in  cotton  production. Members  undertake  to  comply  with  a  number  of  guiding principles,  such  as  promoting  organic  cotton  and  improving the environmental, social and economic aspects of production.\n\nKering is also a member of the Organizing Committee for the Textile  Exchange's  Organic  Cotton  Roundtable  (OCRT).  The OCRT is  a  global  platform  that  supports  and  brings  together the organic cotton community. It has ongoing working groups on business models,  seeds  and  soils, and  consumer engagement, as well as an innovation award.\n\nLastly,  Kering  is  an  active  member  of  a  working  group  on regenerative  agriculture  in  connection  with  cotton  growing, as  part  of  the  collective  Paris  Good  Fashion  initiative. Following  the  publication  of  a  charter  setting  out  what constitutes  regenerative  agriculture,  work  is  now  focused  on establishing  connections  between  agricultural  practices  and measurable positive impacts.\n\n## 4. Support projects in the field\n\nThrough its partnership with the OCA, Kering provides practical support for  on-the-ground  projects  in  India,  with  the  aim  of stepping up the pace at which organic farming practices are adopted by helping farmers making the transition. Furthermore,  through  the  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature, Kering  also  enables  OCA  to  encourage  farmers  already practicing  organic  farming  to  adopt  additional  measures  to achieve quantifiable regeneration of soil and of biodiversity in general.  Through  this  project,  which  is  taking  place  in  four Indian states (Gujarat, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan), 3,500 family farmers will receive support to move from  conventional  to  organic  farming,  and  around  50,000 other  producers  that  are  already  certified  organic  will  be supported in adopting regenerative practices that go beyond the  requirements  of  organic  standards  (e.g.  the  reduction  or elimination of tilling, the use of mulching, planting of ground cover, green manure, diversification of crop rotations and the use  of  compost  made  on  the  farm).  The  three-year  project began  in  late  2021  and  should  support  the  adoption  of organic  and  regenerative  practices  across  a  total  area  of approximately 53,500 hectares.\n\nThe Material Innovation Lab (MIL) is driving innovation in new growing methods, including hydroponic practices and cotton production in controlled environments. These new approaches considerably  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  cotton production  and  could  potentially  improve  quality  and  yields, while reducing dependency on crop seasonality.\n\n## 5. Innovate to develop alternative fibers and ensure greater traceability of cotton\n\nThe  MIL  has  been  working  actively  since  2018  to  obtain  the first fully verified organic cotton fabric using forensic science methods.  The  project  has  been  carried  out  with  two long-standing  Kering  partners,  Italian  weaver  Albini  and Supima,  a  US-based  organization  advocating  high-quality cotton,  as  well  as  with  traceability  expert  Oritain.  The technology uses fingerprints organic cotton, thereby allowing it to be tracked at all stages of production. An exact fingerprint match guarantees the authenticity of the organic cotton, and ensures that neither the raw material nor the fabric or finished product  have  been  substituted,  mixed  or  modified  at  any stage. In 2021, the MIL continued its work with Oritain for the large-scale roll-out of a program to verify the origins of cotton declared  by  Kering's  suppliers.  The  current  Oritain  program (2022-2023) allows the Houses to verify their suppliers' claims, thereby  ensure  compliance  with  the  rules  restricting  the origin of cotton in accordance with the Kering Standards.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Kering  is  helping  its  Houses  identify  and adopt  procedures  to  check  the  integrity  and  consistency  of claims  made  regarding  sourced  materials,  for  example  by having  the  Kering  Test  &  Innovation  Lab  (TIL)  test  for  the presence  of  pesticides  and  genetically  modified  organisms (GMOs) in cotton fibers and fabrics.",

        "page_content": "The Group is seeking to transition some of its cotton sourcing toward alternative plant fibers that have a lower environmental  impact  (such  as  linen  and  hemp),  as  well  as recycled options. Using recycled materials significantly reduces the impact associated with producing virgin materials. In  collaboration  with  the  Houses,  the  MIL  explores  and  tests new solutions that improve these alternatives to virgin cotton - which are increasingly used in the ready-to-wear, denim and accessories categories - in terms of quality and esthetics.\n\nThe MIL also has created a dedicated R&D program to investigate and test innovative textiles and technologies, including a number of  specific  projects  developed  in  collaboration  with  various innovative  suppliers.  The  program  aims  to  launch  advanced industrial  trials  of  these  innovations  in  order  to  meet  the quality  and  esthetic  requirements  of  the  Group's  Houses. Using cotton fibers and fabrics blended in varying proportions with  other  more  environmentally-friendly  plant  fibers  helps reduce Kering's environmental impact (although blended, the yarns  and  fabrics  used  will  remain  entirely  plant-based  and cellulosic).\n\n## 5.3.3.4 Cellulosic fibers\n\n|                   | 2022 traceability rate   | Level of traceability         | Rate of alignment with  the 2022 Kering Standards   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Cellulosic fibers | 77%                      | Back to the country of origin | 76%                                                 |\n\nKering  also  takes  great  care  with  its  sustainable  sourcing strategy  for  cellulosic  fibers  such  as  viscose  since  they  are made from wood pulp, which can present significant risks in terms of deforestation and forest degradation. To a very large extent,  the  Kering  Standards  follow  the  requirements  of Canopy,  an  NGO  that  works  to  protect  the  world's  forests, species and climate. In 2018, Canopy launched ForestMapper, a  Kering-funded  initiative  to  create  an  interactive  map tracking  ancient  and  endangered  forests,  thereby  providing businesses  with  decision-making  supportfor  their  purchases of  paper,  packaging,  wood  and  cellulosic  textiles.  The  Group and  its  Houses  source  primarily  from  suppliers  that  have achieved  the  'dark  green'  level  (score  above  30  out  of  35) according to the Canopy Hot Button Ranking methodology, as well as buying FSC-certified cellulosic fiber.\n\nIn 2022, viscose accounted for approximately 5% of ready-towear raw materials, and in total less than 0.5% of the Group's raw  material  purchases,  obtained  primarily  from  suppliers Lenzing,  Eastman,  Aditya  Birla,  Jilin  and  Enka.  All  achieved  a score of over 30 in Canopy's Hot Button report in 2022, except for Enka, whose score was 28.5.\n\nAnother  major  challenge  for  the  textile  sector  is  the large-scale  recycling  of  blended  fibers,  especially  those containing  cotton  and  cellulose.  Kering  is  looking  into  a number of recycling technologies and, in 2020, joined forces with  Fashion  for  Good  for  the  'Full  Circle  Textiles  Project: Scaling  Innovations  in  Cellulosic  Recycling'  project,  which  is studying  economically  viable  and  scalable  solutions  for  the chemical  recycling  of  cellulose,  in  order  to  enable  a  closedloop  system  to  convert  textile  waste  into  new  man-made cellulosic fibers.\n\nIn  collaboration with Kering's Houses, the MIL is carrying out an  R&D  program  aimed  at  investigating  and  testing  new technologies  and  solutions  to  improve  the  quality  of chemically recycled cotton from both garments (post-consumer)\n\nand waste arising from cotton production (pre-consumer). The program  is  intended  to  increase  the  use  of  materials  with recycled  content  in  categories  such  as  ready-to-wear,  denim and accessories. Chemically recycled cotton is a practical and lower-impact  alternative  to  viscose  and  Tencel,  with  a  look and  feel  similar  to  those  two  materials  when  used  to  make fabrics.\n\nIn  COP 27 in late 2022, Kering added its voice to a collective commitment,  alongside  Canopy  and  other  companies  in  the fashion  industry  such  as  H&M,  Inditex  and  Stella  McCartney, to buy more than half a million metric tons of cellulosic fiber and  paper  packaging  made  from  'next-generation'  materials that  have  a  lower  impact  on  the  climate  and  biodiversity, such  as  agricultural  residues  and  recycled  textiles.  This commitment  is  intended  to  attract  the  investment  needed to  achieve  a  rapid  ramp-up  of  production  of  these  much sought-after alternatives.\n\nIn line with the Kering Standards, all Houses with ready-to-wear ranges (Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci)  favor  using  sustainable  cellulosic fibers  in  their  collections,  particularly  FSC-or  GRS-certified viscose and lyocell, and GRS-certified or recycled cupro. In 2022, 68%  of  the  viscose  used  by  Saint  Laurent  was  FSC-certified. In  2022,  64%  of  the  viscose  used  by  Bottega  Veneta  was certified or recycled.\n\nAll Houses also favor FSC-certified products in their packaging and paper (see section 5.4.4.1).\n\nKering's strategy on sourcing wood-based products (cellulosic materials,  viscose,  etc.)  that  have  an  impact  in  terms  of deforestation  is  described  in  Kering's  responses  to  the  CDP Forests 2022 Questionnaire, available on Kering's website and at  www.cdp.net.  It  sets  out  the  Group's  governance  with respect  to  these  materials,  as  well  as  its  risk  management approach, objectives and performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering and the MIL  have  accordingly  continued  to  identify  new  sources  of high-quality fibers that meet the Group's standards, especially as regards farming practices and animal welfare.\n\nIn 2022, Kering continued its active engagement with various potential and existing wool suppliers to assess them and help them to improve their sustainable environmental, biodiversity, and  animal  welfare  management  practices.  Kering  also provides  expertise  to  various  initiatives  in  the  wool  industry, aimed  at  developing  certifications  and  sustainable  wool production methods, such as the Responsible Wool Standard, the Responsible Mohair Standard and the Responsible Alpaca Standard.\n\nKering  also  continues  to  work  with  experts  in  farming  and sustainable  land  management  practices,  such  as  the  Savory Institute,  to  promote  the  most  ambitious  management standards  for  wildlife  and  biodiversity  conservation  among sheep  farmers,  as  well  as  pastoral  practices  enabling  soil regeneration.\n\nA  fabric  synonymous  with  luxury,  cashmere  has  been  the subject  of  research  and  experimentation  to  improve  the environmental footprint of its production. In 2015, Kering and the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society,  an  international  NGO, launched  the  Gobi  Desert  Cashmere  program  in  the  Gobi region  of  southern  Mongolia  to  promote  sustainable  and traditional production of high-quality cashmere in partnership with  two  cooperatives  of  nomadic  herders  representing 160  families  and  150,000  hectares  of  pasture  in  \u00d6mn\u00f6govi province. In addition to developing the capacity of farmers to produce  better-quality  cashmere,  the  program  focuses  on pastoral techniques such as rotating herds in order to improve impact  on  biodiversity  and  animal  welfare.  In  2022,  the project  was  integrated  within  the  Regenerative  Fund  for Nature  in  order  to  improve  further  the  practices  used  and share learnings with other project implementers supported by the Fund.\n\nKering is also a member of the Market Sector Advisory Group formed  on  the  initiative  of  the  United  Nations  Development Program  (UNDP),  which  works  with  other  stakeholders  in Mongolia to promote harmonization and facilitate collaboration  between  various  existing  programs  there  to support the emergence of a sustainable supply chain.\n\nKering's  sustainable  cashmere  program  is  now  a  notable source of high-quality cashmere for the Group's Houses, as it meets  the  animal  welfare  and  biodiversity  conservation criteria  laid  down  in  the  Kering  Standards,  with  the  added bonus  of  reducing  the  Group's  environmental  footprint. More  than  32  metric  tons  of  responsible  cashmere  have therefore  been  integrated  into  the  supply  chains  of  the Group's Houses since 2015.\n\nIn terms of cashmere from farms in China (Inner Mongolia), in 2021, Kering joined the Good Cashmere Standard (GCS), which promotes  farming  practices  that  meet  demanding  animal\n\nwelfare  requirements.  In  2022,  Kering  took  part  in  the  first annual  GCS  conference  in  Istanbul,  in  order  to  participate  in discussions about continually improving the standard, including by taking into account the environmental impact of farming practices.\n\nCertain Houses including Gucci and Balenciaga use cashmere fibers from production scraps thanks to an innovative process to  recover  scraps,  which  are  sorted  by  quality  and  color  and then transformed into regenerated cashmere fiber. Depending on  the  collection  and  the  level  of  quality  required,  a  certain percentage of virgin fibers can be added before the spinning stage. The  whole  process  takes  place  in  Italy; it is environmentally friendly and fully traceable.\n\nAlongside  their  efforts  to  increase  and  verify  the  use  of certified cashmere and cashmere produced using regenerative practices,  the  MIL  and  the  Group's  Houses  are  seeking  to replace some of the cashmere they use with alternative fibers that have a smaller environmental footprint (such as yak and camel hair) and recycled options.\n\nThe  MIL  also  has  an  R&D  program  to  develop  innovative textiles, including a number of specific projects developed in collaboration with innovative suppliers and relating to various materials and technologies. The program is aiming to launch advanced  industrial  trials  of  these  innovations  in  order  to meet  the  quality  and  esthetic  requirements  of  the  Group's Houses,  comparing  the  resulting  fabrics  with  those  made using  virgin  cashmere.  Using  cashmere  fibers  and  fabrics blended in varying proportions with other fibers with a smaller footprint  and/or  with  recycled  cashmere  will  help  further reduce  Kering's  environmental  impact  (although  mixed,  the yarns and fabrics used will remain entirely of animal origin).\n\nKering supports certified organic silk production that provides better  traceability  and  a  reduced  environmental  impact. Accordingly,  the  MIL  has  established  a  purchasing  platform with the main suppliers of certified silk to guarantee that the Group's Houses have access to this high-quality fiber.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  Gucci  continued  to  increase  the  proportion  of fibers  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards  by  means  of  a number  of  responsible  supply  sources:  GOTS-certified organic  silk  (34%),  GRS-certified  recycled  silk  (12%)  and GRS-certified recycled cashmere (11%). It is also continuing to introduce  GOTS-certified  organic  wool  (29%)  and certified wool guaranteeing regenerative agricultural practices,  as  well  as  ensuiring  alignement  with  animal welfare requirements via ZQ and RWS certifications (31%).\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga  is  increasing  its  use  of  GOTS  or  RWS-certified organic  wool  and  GRS-certified  recycled  wool,  ZQ-certified merino  wool,  regenerated  cashmere  and  organic  silk (GOTS-certified) into its collections. In 2022, 74% of the silk and 90% of the wool purchased by the House was aligned with the Kering Standards and certified sustainable (GOTS, GRS, RWS or ZQ). In addition, 67% of the cashmere used by the House in 2022 came from certified sustainable sources (GCS or GRS).",

The  House  is  also  working  with its suppliers  to  give  preference  to  sourcing  certified cashmere (GCS).\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent is also continuing to source more and more RWS-certified  wool,  since  RWS  is  the  most  advanced standard  in  terms  of  animal  welfare.  In  2022,  49%  of  the silk  and  57%  of  the  wool  purchased  by  the  House  was\n\ncertified  sustainable,  either  by  GOTS,  ZQ  or  RWS  or according  to  the  GRS  standard.  In  2022,  cashmere  from sustainable  certified  sources  accounted  for  65%  of  the House's total volume, and came in particular from Kering's collaboration  with  Gobi  Desert  Cashmere.  In  South  Africa, Saint  Laurent  is  also  developing  a  sustainable  impact platform  aiming  to  support  supply  chain  partners  in  their efforts  to  adopt  regenerative  agriculture  and  responsible breeding practices.\n\n## 5.3.3.6 Precious skins\n\n|                | 2022 traceability rate   | Level of traceability                                                     | Rate of alignment with  the 2022 Kering Standards   |\n|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Precious skins | 94%                      | Back to the farm (farmed  species) or slaughterhouse  (harvested species) | 93%                                                 |\n\nSustainable sourcing of precious skins such  as  from crocodilians and other reptiles, including compliance with the strictest animal welfare standards, is a priority for the Group. Over  the  past  eight  years,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have supported a range of initiatives on sustainable supply chains for  precious  skins.  These  initiatives  combine  the  Houses' Sustainability Departments  and  the  Group's  operations division  (which  manages  its  own  tanneries  and  incoming supplies) and various external stakeholders.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  comply  with  national  and international  legislation  and  regulations  on  the  trade  of precious skins: all skins of species classified as endangered or vulnerable  by  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in Endangered  Species  ('CITES')  are  obtained  with  certificates attesting to their legal origin, issued by CITES and the export authority, to ensure that trade does not threaten endangered species. In 2022, the Group  resumed  its  grass-roots verification  activities,  particularly  in  Southeast  Asia  and specifically Indonesia, but also continued to help international associations working  on  the  ongoing  improvement  of sustainable trade and use of exotic leather.\n\nKering actively supports the development  of  industry standards for all exotic species, such as crocodilians, ostriches and reptiles from Asia.\n\n- \u00b7 SARCA: in 2022, Kering continued to provide financial and technical support to the Southeast Asian Reptile Conservation Alliance (SARCA), which specializes in ethical and sustainable trade in reptiles in Southeast Asia. SARCA is a  multi-stakeholder  platform  that  brings  together  key players  in  the  reptile  trade,  including  luxury  brands, tanneries,  CITES,  scientists  and  conservationists.  SARCA operates a study and research program in Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Thailand to gain a better understanding of the various sustainability challenges generated by the trade in reptile skins, particularly with regard to natural habitat and animal welfare. Players in the Kering value chain were also provided  with  training  on  both  matters.  In  2022,  SARCA published  a  common  standard  for  responsible  trade  in various species of snakes and lizards used in luxury sector supply  chains  (Responsible  Reptile  Sourcing  Standard  RRSS) covering four modules: commercial integrity, animal welfare, social responsibility and environmental responsibility.  In  2022,  to  ensure  that  the  RRSS  is  robust\n\nand exhaustive, SARCA finalized a multi-party consultation process,  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  the  ISEAL Alliance and including scientists, other academics, regulators,  producers,  NGOs,  international  development organizations  and  representatives  of  various  areas  of expertise (human  and  labor  rights, animal welfare, conservation, politics/economics etc.).\n\n- \u00b7 IFCA:  Kering's  exotic  tanneries  are  members  of  the  ICFA (International Crocodilian Farmers Association), a non-profit  organization  created  to  develop  and  improve crocodilian breeding practices that respect animal welfare, the  environment,  and  local  people  and  communities. One  of  the  results  of  this  approach  is  the  development, implementation  and  certification  of  an  international standard (ICFA 1001: 2022 Crocodilian Farming -Requirements)  focusing  on  sustainable  breeding  and animal  welfare  at  all  stages  of  production.  Kering's  exotic tanneries source 100% of their supplies from ICFA certified farms.\n- \u00b7 SAOBC: Kering contributed to the drafting of animal welfare standards for the South African Ostrich Business Chamber (SAOBC),  which  were  made  public  in  2020  and  gradually implemented in 2021. These standards, based on existing codes of conduct and the state of the art, aim to provide a detailed  and  verifiable  best  practice  audit  program.  They are  for  the  most  part  aligned  with  Kering's  own  Animal Welfare Standards for ostriches.\n\nIn 2022, as regards Kering's tanneries:\n\n- \u00b7 100%  of  crocodilian  and  ostrich  skin  suppliers  have certifications  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards  (ICFA  and SAOBC);\n- \u00b7 100% of python and lizard skin suppliers were pre-audited according to SARCA's RRSS protocol.\n\n## 5.3.3.7 Fur\n\nIn  September  2021,  Kering  made  the  decision  to  stop  using animal fur. Starting from the Fall 2022 collections, none of the Group's Houses are using fur. Following Gucci's lead in 2017, all  the  Group's  Houses  -  in  particular  Balenciaga,  Bottega Veneta,  Alexander  McQueen,  Brioni  and  Saint  Laurent  -  have gradually decided to take this step.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  particular,  artisanal,  small-scale mining can endanger communities by causing serious health and  environmental  damage  if  unregulated,  whereas  properly\n\nmanaged  mining  can  generate  responsible  development  for local  communities. Kering is therefore committed to limiting its purchases of metals and precious stones to either certified recycled  sources,  or  mined  sources  in  areas  that  minimize harmful impacts on the environment and generate opportunities for local communities.\n\n|      | 2022 traceability rate                                             | Level of traceability                                                               | Rate of alignment with  the 2022 Kering Standards   |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Gold | 100% for jewelry 99% for all product categories  including plating | Sourced through Kering's  responsible gold sourcing  platform or internal recycling | 99%                                                 |\n\nThe Houses source gold through the Kering Responsible Gold Framework (KRGF),  which  ensures  that  gold  is  traceable  and certified.  The  refiners  selected  by  Kering  as  members  of  the KRGP have RJC Chain of Custody (CoC) certification and supply the  Group's  Houses  only  with  gold  that  is  RJC  recycled, Fairmined,  Fairtrade-certified  or  from  artisanal  mines  whose practices  have  been  checked  by  Kering.  Responsible  gold purchases  totaled  2.549  metric  tons  in  2022,  bringing  the volume  of  responsible  gold  purchased  to  almost  11  metric tons since the platform was launched.\n\nIn addition, for each kilogram of gold purchased via the KRGF, the Houses pay a premium, which is used to endow the Kering Gold Fund. The aim of this fund is to support responsible gold producers,  contribute  to  their  growth  and  support  mining communities. Each year, a committee composed of representatives of Kering and its Houses selects projects to be supported  through  the  Kering  Gold  Fund  in  favor  of  mining communities offering social and environmental benefits.\n\nIn 2022, the Kering Gold Fund provided support for three projects in partnership with mines:\n\n|             |     | French Guiana - since 2018                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Ghana - since 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Colombia - since 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description | \u00b7 \u00b7 | First full reforestation program  for mining sites in the Amazon  rainforest Collaboration with Solicaz  (reforestation expert) and Forest  Finance France (experts in the  development and management  of reforestation initiatives)         | \u00b7 Program to promote women's  independence and improve the  environmental practices of local  artisanal mines (no mercury  used in gold extraction,  alignment with codes of practice  and certifications such as CRAFT  and Fairmined) \u00b7 Collaboration with  Solidaridad | \u00b7 Support for an artisanal gold  mine to help it improve its local  environmental practices  (no mercury used in gold  extraction, alignment with codes of practice and certifications  such as CRAFT and Fairmined) \u00b7 Collaboration with the Alliance                                     |\n| Initiatives | \u00b7   | Reforest all alluvial mining sites,  going beyond regulatory  requirements, under which only  30% of the mined surface must  be reforested.

The Group has since 2021 been working on adopting programs similar to the KRGF for  silver,  platinum  and  palladium,  with  the  pre-qualification of RJC CoC-certified recycled metals.\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018, Gucci has developed an innovative partnership enabling  it  to  use  palladium  recycled  from  catalytic converters  used  in  medical  applications.  This  recycled palladium, which currently covers 100%  of  Gucci's requirements, is produced at an RJC CoC-certified plant in Italy, ensuring full traceability of the metal.\n- \u00b7 Since 2022, Bottega Veneta has been using 100% recycled silver  in  its  collections,  through  a  collaboration  with  its supplier;\n- \u00b7 Pomellato  also  uses  RJC  CoC-certified  recycled  silver  and sources emeralds and rubies from a responsible producer of precious stones.\n\nAs  regards  diamonds,  Kering  is  working  with  its  suppliers  to ensure that all diamonds used in its products comply with the Kimberley process, which aims to ensure the legality of trade in  the  international  market,  so  that  it  does  not  serve  to finance rebel armed conflicts. The Group's Houses map risks in the  regions  from  which  diamonds  originate.  In  2022,  the sourcing of diamonds from Russia was suspended. Kering has also  worked  with  its  Houses  to  roll  out  guidelines  and  best practices  on  the  traceability  and  sustainable  sourcing  of diamonds.  For  example,  Boucheron  sources  diamonds  from RJC CoP-certified suppliers and follows the recommendations of the World Diamond Council System of Warranties.\n\nThe  Houses  also  make  use  of  other  lower-impact  processes: Saint Laurent and Balenciaga have been using physical vapor disposition  (PVD)  coating  on  stainless  steel  for  several  years now  for  certain  metal  parts  on  their  leather  goods.  Brass  is being  phased  out  in  favor  of  steel,  which  has  a  lower environmental  impact.  Steel  is  also  stabilized  using  PVD,  a vacuum  metallization  process  that  deposits  thin  films  of material  in  vapor  form,  which  reduces  the  environmental impact compared to classic electrolytic plating processes.\n\nThe Houses rely on industry certifications and initiatives such as:\n\n- \u00b7 RJC (Responsible Jewellery Council) certification attests to a company's  respect  for  the  environment  and  working conditions  in  the  jewelry  and  watchmaking  sectors. Pomellato, Dodo, Boucheron and Gucci (also RJC CoC-certified)  are  RJC-certified,  while  Qeelin  is  in  the process of gaining certification.\n- \u00b7 Boucheron  is  also  involved  in  mother-of-pearl  supply projects with suppliers certified by the Marine Stewardship Council;\n- \u00b7 In  2015,  Kering  was  a  founding  member  of  the  Coloured Gemstones  Working  Group  (CGWG),  an  initiative  bringing together  jewelry  houses  with  the  aim  of  fostering  greater transparency and positive social and environmental impact in the colored gemstone industry. Boucheron also supports and  is  part  of  this  working  group.  The  CGWG  develops resources and tools that are made available free of charge to  all  entities  involved  in  the  industry,  enabling  them  to identify, avoid and manage the risks and impacts inherent to  their  activities.  In  2020,  the  CGWG  posted  a  common vision  and  the  first  round  of  the  new  tools  on  its  online community  platform.  Kering  and  its  Houses  have  worked actively  on  pilot  projects  for  the  tools  developed  by  the CGWG and encourage their suppliers to use the platform.\n- \u00b7 Finally, after its announcement in 2021, Kering and Cartier -  mandated by Richemont - launched in 2022 the Watch and Jewellery  Initiative  2030,  to  bring  together  watch  and\n\njewelry companies from around the world on the basis of a shared set of key sustainability targets (see section 6.2.2.2).\n\n## 5.3.3.9 Plastics\n\nThe  Houses'  use  of  plastics  is  governed  by  the  Kering Standards. Kering has had a zero-PVC product policy in place since 2012 and aims to stop using single-use plastics by 2025 (see  section  5.4.4.1).  In  addition,  the  Houses  must  favor plastics  with  recycled  content  or,  failing  that,  certified  biobased  content,  and  ensure  that  the  chemicals  used  comply with the Group's MRSL and PRSL. For the product end-of-life phase, the Kering Standards emphasize recyclability.\n\nBecause of the large number of plastic alternatives available, it is not  easy  to  compare  environmental  performance  or understand  supplier  claims.  This  is  why  Kering  regularly organizes  dedicated  working  groups:  in  late  2021  and  2022, particular  effort  was  made  to  review  existing  standards  and certifications  concerning  the  recycled  and  bio-based  content of plastics and their end-of-life phase (recyclability, biodegradability and compostability).\n\nThe impact of microfiber pollution on human health and the environment  is  a  major  concern  for  the  textile  industry. These impacts have not yet been fully quantified but it is clear that  a  high  percentage  of  microfiber  pollution  in  the  oceans and in  the  air  comes  from  clothing,  not  just  synthetic  fibers but  also  natural  fibers.  Kering  is  working  on  eliminating  the use of toxic chemical products and removing microfibers and microplastics from its production processes. The Group is also continuing  to  keep  a  close  eye  on  studies  and  industry developments concerning micro- and macro-plastic pollution in  oceans  and  waterways,  with  the  hope  of  including  their impact in its EP&L methodology in the near future.\n\nIn 2021, Kering joined forces with The Microfibre Consortium as  part  of  a  collaborative  approach  between  manufacturers and  brands  to  highlight  the  growing  need  for  better understanding  of  microfiber  pollution  and  its  adverse  effect on  aquatic  environments  and  air  quality.  The  consortium  is calling for the sector to measure, map, guide and reduce levels of microfiber release.\n\nThe Material Innovation Lab (MIL) launched a pilot project in 2021 to trial an industrial-scale microfiber filtration system in Kering's supply chain. The results and feedback from this pilot project will be used to optimize and further refine the filtering process  and  validate  the  effectiveness  of  microfiber  capture. The  results  will  also  be  made  available  to  the  rest  of  the industry.\n\nThe Group firmly believes that the best solution is to prevent microfiber  leakage  as  early  on  as  possible  in  the  product lifecycle,  first  of  all  by  working  on  eco-design,  for  example using  the  best  quality  material  and  more  sustainable  long fibers,  with  specific  fabric  structures,  material  compositions, fibers, yarns and dyeing processes to create more sustainable products, as well as limiting microfiber release.\n\nThe approach to eliminating microfibers needs to be open and collective. Kering also requires its suppliers to comply with its Sustainability  Principles,  including  implementing  mitigation measures to reduce microfiber leakage during the manufacturing phases, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 preferring continuous and/or reinforced fibers;\n- \u00b7 using dyeing, finishing and cutting processes that preserve fiber yarn strength and reduce fiber irregularities;\n- \u00b7 choosing washing processes that reduce microfiber leakage (closed-loop or microfiber filters);\n- \u00b7 increasing pre-washing and filtering of the finished product at the manufacturing plant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Houses are continuing  to  reduce  the  proportion  of  synthetic  materials used  and  gradually  incorporate  new  alternative  materials  as well as more responsible synthetic fibers into their collections, made from biomaterials or recycled:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci,  Alexander  McQueen,  Saint  Laurent,  Balenciaga  and Brioni  collections  are  increasingly  incorporating  ECONYL\u00ae. In  2022,  49%  of  nylon  used  by  Gucci  was  recycled.  In support  of  a  continuous  loop  approach,  ECONYL\u00ae  scraps have  been  recovered  from  the  production  processes  of Gucci's  Off  the  Grid  products  and  recycled  to  create  new ECONYL\u00ae  materials as part of the Gucci-ECONYL\u00ae Pre-Consumer Fabric Take Back Program since 2018.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga is stepping up the development and incorporation  of  recycled  polyester  into  its  ready-to-wear and leather goods collections. For its spring/summer 2022 ready-to-wear  collections,  65%  of  the  recycled  synthetic fibers used were GRS-certified.\n- \u00b7 Since 2015, Gucci has been gradually replacing the plastic used  in  the  heels  of  its  shoes  with  recycled  ABS  plastic. In 2022, it made 442,000 pairs of shoes with soles made of 25% bio-based TPU. The House is involved in a number of projects to allow for the large-scale production of recycled or bio-based sustainable components in its shoe collections.\n\n## 5.3.4 Animal welfare: the Kering Animal Welfare Standards\n\nKering  believes  that  the  products  developed  by  its  Houses must meet the highest standards of quality in all aspects of production, including those related to the welfare of animals supplying many of the materials used by the Houses.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Kering  published  its  Animal  Welfare Standards  in  2019,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the  highest standards of animal welfare across the Group's supply chain. They  cover  all  the  species  featuring  in  the  Group's  supply chains  around  the  world,  namely  cattle  and  calves,  sheep, goats, ostriches, crocodiles, alligators, pythons, and mammals bred for their fur, although the Group decided in 2021 to stop using  fur.  For  each  of  these  species,  the  open-source Standards highlight specific challenges, laying down breeding, transportation  and  slaughtering  requirements,  and  provide the list of existing certifications serving as benchmarks. Kering has  also  published  more  detailed  individual  Standards  for cattle,  calves,  sheep  and  goats,  as  well  as  guidelines  for slaughterhouses.  In  2021,  these  Standards  were  updated  to reflect  changes  in  practices  and  experience  gained  during visits and assessments within our value chains.\n\nDeveloped  with  input  from  animal  welfare  experts,  farmers and herders, scientists and NGOs, the Standards are based on the  latest  scientific  research,  as  well  as  prevailing  legislation and standards, best management practices and recommendations from a range of sectors. As such, they are based  on  external  expertise,  including  an  external  review  by several specialized associations such as the Royal Society for\n\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in 2017, Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) and the Fondation Nicolas Hulot pour la Nature et l'Homme (FNH) in 2018, and Welfarm and Oeuvre d'Assistance aux B\u00eates d'Abattoirs (OABA) in 2021.\n\nThe Standards lay down a number of requirements for animal management that would significantly improve the welfare of animals in countries around the world if they were adopted by the  industry  more  broadly.  They  include  Bronze,  Silver  and Gold  tiers  that  provide  clear  guidance  on  critical  compliance requirements  and  encourage  the  Group's  suppliers  to  make continuous improvements.\n\nSpecific  assessment  protocols  describing  how  Kering  and  its Houses  can  measure  their  suppliers'  compliance  with  the Standards have been developed. The protocols cover livestock rearing,  transportation  and  slaughter  conditions,  but  also include broader  criteria such  as  farms'  environmental performance  and  their  impact  on  local  communities  and people.\n\nA country-by-country risk assessment approach is implemented, based  on  the  Animal  Protection  Index  of  NGO  World  Animal Protection.  It  assesses  the  risks  inherent  to  each  country  in terms  of  animal  welfare,  based  on  indicators  such  as  the prevailing  legislation  and  the  voluntary  commitments  that exist. The  level  of  verification  implemented  to  ensure compliance  with  Kering's  Standards  is  then  adapted  to  this level  of  risk  by  country,  as  well  as  other  factors  such  as  the type and volumes of raw materials concerned.\n\nIn  2022,  the  monitoring  and  verification  of  compliance  with animal welfare standards in the Group's various supply chains focused  on  the  leather  sector.  This  led  to  a  case-by-case action  plan  reflecting  the  risk  presented  by  the  countries  of operation  and  with  regard  to  existing  animal  welfare certifications  for  slaughterhouses.  In  2022,  a  dozen  field evaluations  were  carried  out  to  verify  that  Kering's  animal welfare requirements were being met. In the absence of field evaluations,  a  bibliographical  evaluation  of  a  number  of standards and suppliers was carried out with regard to their approaches  to  animal  welfare,  particularly  for  the  wool  and leather supply chains.\n\nKering is also working with the sector to improve respect for animal welfare and the alignment of sector standards relating to  precious  skins  (see  section  5.3.3.6),  materials  from  cattle, sheep and goats (see section 5.3.3.2) and participants in the agri-food industry (see section 5.3.3.2).\n\nIn  2022,  Kering  operated  in  the  fragrances  and  cosmetics category  through  licensing  agreements  between  its  main Houses and leading industry players such as L'Or\u00e9al, Coty and Interparfums  to  develop  and  sell  fragrances  and  cosmetics. Accordingly, Kering and its Houses do not directly manufacture  products  or  conduct  animal  testing  in  this segment. The entities with which Kering and its Houses have signed licensing agreements have developed strict policies on animal  testing,  compliant  with  internationally  recognized standards and best practices. Their approaches and requirements  are  set  out  in  their  respective  reporting documents.  In  particular,  Kering  has  laid  down  specific requirements for fragrances and cosmetics in its Sustainability Principles, available on the Group website.",

The analysis carried out as part of the EP&L methodology shows a range of impacts on water use and pollution can give rise to significant\n\nrisks  in  respect  of  the  availability  and  quality  of  water  in various  parts  of  the  world.  For  instance,  water  pollution  can disrupt  aquatic  ecosystems  through  eutrophication,  and mismanagement  of  water  use  can  create  life-threatening competition for local communities (competition between the production of raw materials and food, for example). This can have adverse human health impacts (illnesses caused by poor water  quality),  and  can  also  result  in  reduced  agricultural yields and other serious disruptions of ecosystem services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                    | END OF LIFE   | PRODUCT USE   | TIER 0 Operations and stores   |           | TIER 1 Final assembly   | TIER 3 Raw materials processing TIER 2 Manufacturing   | TIER 4 Raw materials production   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 38,586 dam 3 Water  consumption 4% |               |               |                                |           | 3                       | 3                                                      |                                   |\n| Water  pollution 15%               | 2 dam 3       | 4,137 dam 3   | 690 dam 3                      | 5,845 dam | 7,565 dam               | 4,103 dam 3                                            | 16,244 dam 3                      |\n| 4,462 t                            | 0 t           | 196 t         | 5 t                            | 101 t     | 102 t                   | 356 t                                                  | 3,702 t                           |\n\nThe  Group's  2022  EP&L  results  show  that  4%  of  Kering's monetized  environmental  impacts  relate  to  water  use  while 15% concern wastewater discharges, which mostly arise in Tier 4 (production  of  raw  materials)  of  its  supply  chains, particularly  in  the  production  of  leather,  metals,  plant  fibers and precious skins.\n\nKering's water management strategy is detailed in the Group's public response to the 2022 CDP Water Security Questionnaire (Kering  obtained  a  score  of  A-),  which  can  be  accessed  on Kering's  website  and  www.cdp.net  websites.  It  sets  out  the Group's  governance  with  respect  to  water  management,  risk management and the Group's objectives and performance.\n\n## 5.3.5.1 Kering's water footprint\n\n## Kering's water consumption within its own operations\n\nOperations and sites under Kering's direct control accounted for 3% of the Group's total water consumption (EP&L scope).\n\n## Water consumption in 2022, 2021 and 2020 (m\u00b3)\n\n|                                     | 2022      | 2021    | 2020      | Change 2022/2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Industrial water                    | 330,099   | 335,010 | 250,870   | -1%                |\n| of which groundwater                | 226,564   | 270,113 | 198,379   | -16%               |\n| of which water from public  network | 103,535   | 64,897  | 52,491    | 60%                |\n| Domestic water                      | 703,102   | 618,083 | 832,116   | 14%                |\n| TOTAL                               | 1,033,201 | 953,093 | 1,082,986 | 8%                 |\n\nWithin the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 68%  of  water  consumed  is  used  for  domestic  purposes (store  cleaning,  sanitary  facilities,  etc.)  and  32%  for industrial purposes, of which 22% comes from groundwater;\n- \u00b7 The  Group's  industrial  water  consumption  is  primarily attributable  to  its  tanneries,  none  of  which  is  located  in water-stressed  zones.  Tanneries'  water  consumption  was stable  in  2022  compared  to  2021.  However,  tanneries reduced their use of groundwater, preferring to use water from the public network.\n\nTotal water consumption rose by 8% between 2021 and 2022, mainly in relation to an increase in domestic water consumption. That increase arose from a larger number of employees being present  at  the  Group's  various  sites.  However,  consumption was  lower  in  2022  than  in  2020,  particularly  as  regards domestic water.\n\n## Initiatives for reducing consumption in Kering's operations\n\nGiven the nature of Kering's operations, the direct environmental  impact  of  its  water  consumption  is  not significant.  However,  the  Houses  still  work  tirelessly  to  come up  with  innovative  tanning  processes  that  eliminate  heavy metals  and  use  less  water.  As  a  result,  water  consumption intensity  (cubic  meters  of  industrial  water  consumed/Group revenue)  declined  by  15%  between  2021  and  2022.  For example,  Gucci's  Scrap-less  initiative  enables  the  House  to only treat the leather needed for product fabrication, thereby reducing use of chemicals and water consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  are  also  implementing  measures  to reduce  domestic  water  consumption,  particularly  at  their headquarters and offices. In the Kering Standards dedicated to stores, the Group has established precise technical criteria in order to limit their energy and domestic water consumption. For example, the standards prohibit the use of drinking water as a heat sink in air conditioning systems, encourage the use of  non-drinking  water  (e.g.  recovered  rainwater)  for  certain maintenance  purposes,  and  require  the  installation  of plumbing systems that have low water consumption.\n\nThe  Houses  also  have  initiatives  to  reduce  their  water consumption:\n\n- \u00b7 Measures  being  rolled  out  at  Gucci,  Balenciaga,  Bottega Veneta,  Saint  Laurent  and  Kering  include  water  fountains, filters, water-saving  devices  and  rainwater  harvesting systems at logistics sites.\n- \u00b7 Bottega Veneta has reduced water consumption by almost 30% at its Montebello site as part of its LEED certification process.  At  this  site,  rainwater  collection  is  supplemented by  the  recovery  of  used  water  from  the  air-conditioning system, which also allows heat recovery.\n- \u00b7 At one of its factories, Kering Eyewear has set up a station for  treating  wastewater  from  its  closed-loop  production process,  allowing  100%  of  treated  water  to  be  reinjected into the process.\n\n## Initiatives for reducing consumption in Kering's supply chain\n\nKering is applying its EP&L approach to conduct an innovative review  of  responsible  water  management  across  its  entire production  chain.  Indirect  water  consumption  linked  to  the use of agricultural raw materials such as cotton and extraction of precious metals is a serious environmental concern.\n\nAs  regards  production  processes,  the  Kering  Standards encourage suppliers to use water-efficient equipment, automate water flows, and increase liquor ratios in dyeing and finishing processes. They also encourage the use of waterless dyes and efficient dyeing technologies, such as cold pad batch dyeing.  Wet  processing  factories  (dyeing,  finishing,  printing and  tanning)  are  encouraged  to  install  a  reverse  osmosis system  at  the  end  of  the  wastewater  treatment  process  in order to close the water loop.\n\nIn addition, the \"Clean by Design\" program involving 56 textile suppliers  includes  measures  to  reduce  water  and  chemicals use.  On  average,  factories  applying  the  program  reduce  their water  use  by  5  to  10%.  In  2022,  one  supplier  achieved  the largest  reduction  in  water  consumption  ever  seen  by  Kering, cutting consumption by around 1 million m 2 /month obtained by  improving  water  flow  controls.  Thanks  to  this,  the  water consumption of this supplier decreased by 51%.\n\nThe Houses also have initiatives to reduce water consumption in  their  supply  chains.  For  example,  Balenciaga  gives  priority to  tanneries  and  denim  suppliers  that  are  making  a  genuine effort to reduce energy and water use in their treatment and finishing processes. All ready-to-wear Houses also favor using organic materials and recycled fibers, allowing them to reduce water consumption in their supply chains.\n\n## 5.3.5.2 Management of chemicals and wastewater discharges\n\nHundreds  of  chemicals  are  used  in  the  production  of  items made  by  Kering's  Houses.  Risk  mapping  conducted  in  2014 served  to  select  priority  areas  on  which  to  focus  efforts  to eliminate  all  hazardous  substances  from  supply  chains. This  mapping,  the  results  of  which  are  updated  regularly,  is based  on  the  inherent  chemical  risks  of  the  processes,  the production  geography,  the  sector's  maturity  and  production volumes. Leather (including tanning and finishing) and textiles (especially  dyeing)  represent  the  biggest  sources  of  risk. The Jewelry sector has been rated as least at risk among the Group's activities.\n\nBecause industrial sites use chemicals, pollutants are found in their  wastewater  discharges.  As  a  result,  the  chemicals  used by  sites  and  the  effluents  they  discharge  must  be  managed properly in order to prevent and limit this pollution.\n\n## Within Kering's own operations\n\nThough  the  water  discharge  impact  from  Kering's  directly owned operations is  not  significant  by  itself,  discharge  from textile  and  leather  industry  production  facilities  can  have  a more significant  environmental  impact,  especially  as  regards chemical pollutants.\n\nA total of 75% of water is discharged.\n\nWater management is an integral part of the Kering Standards, which set out guidelines for the Group's main manufacturing processes  (tanning,  textile  processing  and  leather  goods manufacturing).\n\nSpecial  wastewater  treatment  measures  are  required  for tanneries, which use large amounts of water. Each tannery has its  own  on-site  wastewater  treatment  plant.  At  all  of  the Group's  tanneries,  wastewater  is  pre-treated  on  site  before continuing  the  wastewater  treatment  process.  The  Group's four  Italian  tanneries  pre-treat  their  wastewater  containing chromium,  which  is  then  sent  to  a  special  treatment  plant used by several other tanneries, which purifies the water and recovers the chromium. The Group's other two tanneries have treatment plants that use sedimentation and physicochemical and biological treatment techniques.\n\nTo  ensure  compliance  with  local  wastewater  legislation, analyses  are  regularly  carried  out  at  each  tannery  and  the results  are  continuously  monitored.  If  any  anomalies  are recorded,  dedicated  procedures  and  action  plans  are  put  in place  and,  where  applicable,  described  in  the  ISO  14001certified environmental management system.\n\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the most relevant indicator of the quality of effluents after treatment. It allows the overall amount of organic pollutants in wastewater to be assessed.\n\n## Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) after treatment tanneries in 2022 and 2021 (in metric tons)\n\n|     |   2022 |   2021 | Change 2022/2021   |\n|-----|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| COD |     34 |     57 | -39%               |\n\nIn 2022, COD fell sharply in connection with a reduction in the amount  of  water  discharged  by  the  tanneries,  and  with specific  efforts  by  one  tannery  to  limit  its  wastewater discharges, reducing them by 63% between 2021 and 2022.",

To do so, the Group has established two types of lists of substances subject to restrictions:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List  (MRSL)  for production processes;\n- \u00b7 the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) for products.\n\n## Focus on: Kering's commitments and objectives concerning chemicals management\n\n- \u00b7 Kering has set itself the target of eliminating all hazardous chemicals from all its Houses' production.\n- \u00b7 Contractual  requirements  for  all  suppliers  include  the  implementation  of  a  chemicals  management  system  within businesses and the roll-out of these requirements among their suppliers during the early stages.\n- \u00b7 By 2025:\n- - 100% of eligible suppliers evaluated in the Vendor Portal as regards chemicals management and compliance with the MRSL;\n- - 100% of strategic suppliers covered by the MRSL compliance control process, which includes audit, certification and the ZDHC Supplier to Zero program;\n- - Testing of wastewater, in line with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, for all strategic suppliers.\n\nKering  has  been  a  signatory  member  of  the  ZDHC  (Zero Discharge  of  Hazardous  Chemicals)  program  since  2016.  The ZDHC program is supported by roughly 30 major international brands and upwards of 100 industrial partners committed to encouraging sector-wide take-up of best practices, application of  the  MRSL  (Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List)  and the use of sustainable chemicals with a view to eradicating the most  hazardous  substances  from  textiles,  leather  and footwear industry supply chains. Kering plays an active role in the work of the ZDHC program and, in 2022, continued to help it  expand  its  activity  in  Italy  by  promoting  contact  with  key players and suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, Kering continued to participate in the ZDHC Brands to Zero program, for which purpose the Group's actions taken to eliminate dangerous chemicals from its production processes were  evaluated  by  a  third  party.  The  primary  goal  of  this initiative  is  to  assess  members'  alignment  with  the  ZDHC program and to promote the harmonization of industry efforts to eliminate hazardous chemicals from production processes by defining a bespoke roadmap for each signatory.\n\nThe  new  ZDHC  Supplier  to  Zero  program  was  launched  in Europe  in  2021.  Kering's  operational  teams  were  closely involved in defining this program and the evaluation criteria. In 2022, Kering continued to roll out the ZDHC Supplier to Zero program  across  its  supply  chains.  In  2022,  157  companies supplying Kering, representing 37% of raw materials purchases (leather  and  fabrics),  37%  of  its  leather  products  and  shoes manufacturers  and  47%  of  finished  products  bought  for  the Group's ready-to-wear items and accessories, took part in the ZDHC Supplier To Zero webinar.\n\nAlso  in  2022,  in  cooperation  with  another  ZDHC  signatory, Kering  organized  training  sessions  to  promote  the  ZDHC Supplier to Zero program involving 33 of the Group's strategic suppliers. The sessions were held with the support of a ZDHC training  provider  in  order  to  ensure  a  consistent  approach. In  accordance  with  its  aim  of  promoting  the  ZDHC  program, Kering  continued  to  support  its  supply  chains  through  the distribution  of  ZDHC  vouchers  suitable  for  the  Foundational level  certification  of  the  program,  and  by  providing  active support  in  deploying  ZDHC  InCheck  report  and  ZDHC ClearStream.\n\nFurthermore, since 2014, Kering has provided active support for its key suppliers in the leather (tanneries and suppliers in charge of production), textiles and finished product categories in  ready-to-wear  and  accessories,  to  encourage  them  to comply  with  the  MRSL,  offering  implementation  tools  and training.\n\n## 5.3.5.3 Roll-out of MRSL in the supply chain\n\nThe  MRSL  is  focused  on  discontinuing  the  use  of  dangerous chemicals in the manufacturing process, firstly to ensure that workers  within  the  Group's  operations  and  in  the  supply chains  of  the  Houses  are  not  exposed  to  hazardous substances,  and  secondly  to  reduce  toxic  discharges  into water.\n\nSince  2014,  Kering  has  provided  active  support  for  its  key suppliers in the leather (tanneries and suppliers in charge of production), textiles and finished product categories in readyto-wear  and  accessories  to  encourage  them  to  comply  with the MRSL, offering implementation tools and training.\n\n## 1) Contractual requirements\n\nThe MRSL requirements signed with suppliers since 2015 have been contractually binding since January 1, 2020. This means that no substance listed in Kering's MRSL can be intentionally used  in  the  manufacturing  processes  of  the  Houses'  supply chains.  Version  2.0  of  Kering's  MRSL,  released  in  2020  and effective  since  April  2021,  corresponds  to  the  MRSL  V2.0 of the  Zero  Discharge  of  Hazardous  Chemicals  (ZDHC) industry  standard,  supplemented  by  a  ban  on  certain perfluorochemicals  (PFCs).  Contractual  requirements  for  all suppliers  also  include  the  implementation  of  a  chemicals management  system  within  businesses  and  the  roll-out  of these requirements among suppliers upstream.\n\n## 2) Supplier evaluation\n\nKering has developed  a  'chemicals  management/MRSL compliance' indicator in the Vendor Portal. To do this, Kering evaluated more than 1,300 suppliers (representing 95% of its purchasing)  in  different  product  categories  by  means  of detailed  annual  self-assessment  questionnaires  covering  all data to be aligned with Kering's contractual requirements, in addition  to  detailed  evaluations  or  audits  of  strategic suppliers.  87%  (by  value)  of  suppliers  evaluated  obtained  a good or excellent score. The percentage was 90% among the Group's  strategic  suppliers.  Kering's  aim  is  for  all  eligible suppliers  to  be  evaluated  using  this  indicator  by  2025.  The results  are  reviewed  biannually  with  the  Houses'  operations departments. These committee meetings provide the opportunity  to  discuss  supplier  compliance  and  define measures  to  be  taken  for  the  suppliers  concerned,  such  as help  to  improve  their  performance,  implementation  of remedial  measures  or  even  the  termination  of  business relations with suppliers that fail to comply. In addition, on-site audits are conducted on strategic suppliers to check whether they meet requirements relating to chemicals management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  a  result, 84% of raw materials purchases (leather and fabrics) and 68% of finished products purchases for Kering's ready-to-wear and accessories products were either covered by a Kering audit or certified by a third party with regard to chemicals management. In terms of chemicals management, Kering has set itself the target of ensuring that the process for checking compliance  with  the  MRSL  -  which  includes  attaining  the 'Progressive'  level  of  the  ZDHC  Supplier  to  Zero  program  covers all strategic suppliers by 2025.\n\nKering acknowledges that with the current level of technology and  knowledge,  despite  good  chemicals  management  at  the outset,  some  contamination  by  hazardous  chemicals  in production  processes  could  still  be  possible  and  affect  the quality  of  water  discharged  by  facilities.  In  order  to  promote ongoing  improvement  in  chemicals  management,  Kering intends  to  step  up  its  checks  of  MRSL  compliance  by  also performing tests  on  wastewater  for  all  strategic  suppliers  by 2025. This approach is recommended by ZDHC and will make it possible  to  identify  compliance  failings  and  potential contamination by analyzing the root causes and improving the quality and safety of effluents.\n\n## 3) Ongoing training\n\nKering has continued to enhance its capabilities internally and with  its  suppliers  with  regard  to  these  issues  by  means  of various  training  sessions  on  MRSL  management.  In  2022, 11  training  sessions  were  organized  for  more  than  1,000 Group  suppliers  in  the  leather,  shoes  and  ready-to-wear categories (including tanneries, textile factories, metal suppliers and finished goods manufacturers).\n\nAn  Idea  Lab  on  the  management  of  chemicals  was  held  in 2022. This in-house event brought together representatives of the  various  Houses  and  aimed  at  providing  training  and information  on  the  subject,  focusing  on  ZDHC-related initiatives, and at taking joint decisions on Kering's action and strategy in this area.\n\nIn  2018,  Bottega  Veneta  was  the  first  House  to  roll  out  the MRSL with a group of leather goods and shoe manufacturers. Bottega Veneta has continued its work to bring an ever-greater proportion of leather goods and shoe production workshops in  line  with  its  MRSL  approach.  Since  2019,  a  total  of  12 suppliers  have  received  training  in  the  MRSL  and  its  tools, either at the House's headquarters or by videoconference.\n\nGucci, as Chair of the Sustainability Committee of the Camera Nazionale  Della  Moda  (CNMI),  has  been  particularly  active  in the debate on the negative impact of dangerous chemicals in the  luxury  industry,  and  has  contributed  to  the  preparation and  circulation  of  Industry  Guidelines  on  eco-toxicological requirements  for  apparel,  leather  goods,  footwear  and accessories. The House has completed the implementation of the MRSL with major raw materials, shoes, leather goods and ready-to-wear suppliers.\n\nThere have also been a number of initiatives at the level of the Houses to ensure the quality of their products and the safety of  their  consumers  in  line  with  regulatory  requirements  (see section 6.1.3).\n\n## 5.3.6 Air pollution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  2022  EP&L  results  show  that  8%  of  Kering's monetized environmental impacts relate to air pollution, and that  they  mostly  happen  in  Tier  4  (production  of  raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\nSolvents used in tanneries contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released in gaseous form into the atmosphere. There are specific guidelines for managing VOCs and emissions are calculated and monitored closely by each of the Group's tanneries.\n\n## Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in 2022 and 2021 (in metric tons)\n\n|      |   2022 |   2021 | Change 2022 2021   |\n|------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| VOCs |     65 |     58 | 12%                |",

Transitioning  to  a  truly circular  economy  requires  a  complete  rethink  of  the  way  we produce and use resources as well as the way we extend the life of products.\n\nA circular economy provides the opportunity not only to move towards a positive impact on resources, but also to innovate in order  to  better  serve  clients  and  to  further  advance  its sustainability  goals.  As  a  business,  Kering  sees  the  circular economy  as  an  opportunity  to  create  an  industry  fit  for purpose  for  future  generations.  The  'Coming  Full  Circle' ambition, published in 2021, has three central aspects:\n\n- 1. luxury that lasts;\n- 2. regenerative sourcing and clean production;\n- 3. making production processes more efficient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKering  has  set  a  series  of  targets:  zero  product  destruction, 100%  renewable  energy  by  2022,  zero  single-use  plastic  by 2025,  100%  of  raw  materials  to  comply  with  the  Kering Standards by 2025, and zero microfiber leakage by 2030.\n\nIn  addition,  it  is  essential  for  Kering  to  take  collaborative action,  with  its  Houses  and  with  partners  across  its  value chain,  whilst  introducing  open-source  solutions  to  allow  its ecosystem  to  evolve.  Launched  in  2019,  the  Fashion  Pact represents  an  initial  step  in  the  industry's  journey  towards increased responsibility for its environmental impact. In 2021, Kering  announced  the  launch  of  the  Made  in  Italy  project, conducted by the Apparel Impact Institute, which works with various brands  in order to improve  efficiency, waste management and energy use among our suppliers.

To  achieve this, it provides operational  support to the Group's Houses and  their existing and/or new suppliers. The MIL also provides technical  support for R&D efforts relating to  sustainable fabrics, to design new  textile and yarn structure for different product categories. The MIL showroom of sustainable  materials is updated every six months to incorporate the most updated  collections of luxury-level fabrics and  yearns suppliers. All obsolete  collections are regularly donated to | The MIL assists the Houses to source  sustainable raw materials (such as  certified silk, organic cotton, wool,  cashmere, viscose, etc.)  by creating  connections between raw material  producers and finished product  manufacturers to implement dedicated  supply chain. MIL support Kering Houses to promote  more structured sourcing strategy to their  suppliers aimed to increase the offer of  sustainable materials in collections by  contributing financially and with  dedicated training. Finally, to ensure as much traceability as  possible for its supply chains, the MIL  supports the Houses in collecting and  checking sustainability certificate | The MIL identifies, monitors and  encourages the incorporation of  sustainable textile innovations by meeting with innovators and assessing their  technologies with a view to having them  implemented by the Group's Houses.  Operational pilot projects have been  launched concerning new processes and  materials in partnership with strategic  suppliers, to validate, implement and  extend innovations within the Houses'  supply chains and/or collections.

        "page_content": "## Partnership with Fashion for Good\n\nKering  became  a  founding  partner  of  the  Fashion  for  Good accelerator in 2017. Its aim is to drive innovation in the luxury and  fashion  industries  by  factoring  in  sustainability  criteria and  supporting  the  development  of  startups  through  an intensive  accelerator  program.  This  comprehensive  industrywide innovation ecosystem is expanding: in 2022, Fashion for Good had 20 corporate partners, including fashion groups and brands such as Adidas, Target, PVH Corp and Patagonia, along with  suppliers  and  financial  institutions,  which  take  part  in pilot  programs, publish industry reports and provide support for more than 143 innovators.\n\nThe  program  helps  partners  identify  the  most  compelling innovative  startups  in  the  sector  and  support  them  in  their development. Candidate startups must take a 360\u00b0 approach to innovation, focusing on five priority areas: raw materials with  an  emphasis  on  regenerated  or  renewable  materials  manufacturing processes (dyeing and processing of materials), manufacturing  and  particularly  zero-waste  techniques,  new business models (including second-hand fashion) and product end-of-life (recycling, circular economy). In 2022, there was a particular  focus  on  leather  alternatives  (bio-sourced  or recycled  materials)  and  on  traceability  and  transparency throughout the supply chain.\n\nThe  accent  is  placed  on  projects  and  technologies  that  can help players in the textile industry reduce their consumption of  water  and  energy,  production  of  waste  and  use  of chemicals, adopt alternatives to fossil fuels, and improve their working methods.\n\nOf the 103 pilot projects launched via the accelerator, 23 were coordinated with Kering Houses through the MIL and at Group level. In 2022, these included:\n\n- \u00b7 the D(r)ye Factory of the Future project to trial innovations in the pre-treatment and dyeing of cotton fibers and more specifically denim, wool, polyester and wool-cotton blends, in order to reduce water, energy and chemicals consumption during the dyeing process;\n- \u00b7 a  hydroponic  cotton  project,  aiming  to  grow  cotton  in conditions similar to those of a greenhouse,  with considerable  reduction  in  the  use  of  water,  chemical pesticides  and  synthetic  fertilizers,  while  quadrupling yields;\n- \u00b7 The 'Black Pigment Project' for validating and scaling bioblack  pigments  derived  from  waste  feedstocks  such  as industrial  carbon,  algae  and  wood  that  could  replace synthetic  carbon  black  dyes  offering  a  more  sustainable means  of  dope  dyeing  textile  production  with  a  lower carbon impact;\n- \u00b7 a pilot project to develop a plant-based, pre-reduced indigo -  which  no  longer  needs  to  be  chemically  reduced  in denim  mills  -  as  an  alternative  to  petrochemical-based synthetic indigo dyes, in a closed-loop production system.\n\n## Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL) for watches and jewelry\n\nThe roadmap for the Sustainable Innovation Lab (SIL), set up in  Switzerland  in  early  2020,  is  centered  around  themes  in which innovation can help reduce the environmental impact\n\nassociated  with  watchmarking  and  jewelry  activities:  a  high proportion  of  recycled  materials,  partly  bio-based  materials, more ecological transformation processes, and materials and processes  allowing  for  longer  product  use.  The  SIL  also promotes the creativity generated by these new materials and processes  as  a  result  of  both  their  possibilities  and  their constraints.\n\nA collective approach, bringing together several brands around the  same  topic  and  involving  academic  and  industrial partners at the cutting edge in their field, is essential for the SIL.  This  is  an  effective  way  of  achieving  ambitions  such  as replacing certain metals with composite materials made from natural fibers, making hard materials using less energy-intensive processes, and developing new metal alloys. Research contracts have been entered into with organizations such as Politecnico di Milano and the CNRS Institute.\n\nBy working as closely as possible with brands, and particularly their creatives, technicians and manufacturers, the SIL ensures that the specifics of each House are taken into account in this collective approach in order to facilitate the incorporation of these technologies into their products.\n\nIn  2022,  the  SIL  worked  more  specifically  on  alternatives  to precious stones and on processes and materials that have less of  an  environmental  impact  (e.g.  ceramics  produced  using limited energy consumption, green batteries etc.).\n\n## K Generation Award\n\nKering and the global innovation platform Plug and Play China have  created  the  Kering  Generation  Awards  to  promote sustainable  innovation  in  the  fashion  industry.  As  well  as identifying  innovators  in  sustainable  fashion  in  China,  this award  program  also  seeks  to  raise  awareness  within  the Chinese fashion ecosystem regarding the importance of more responsible  fashion.  Following  the  first  awards  in  2019,  the 2021 edition focused on innovation related to biodiversity for fashion, covering four sub-themes: water, soil, animal welfare and raising public awareness.\n\nThree Chinese startups were selected for their technology and potential to transform fashion. Peelsphere won the first prize, worth  \u20ac100,000,  for  its  innovative  renewable  material  made from algae, vegetable and fruit waste. OTEX won an award for its  work  on  soil  health.  Zeno  Technology  won  third  prize  for developing  a  dyeing  solution  capable  of  covering  the  entire process  from  dye  production  to  printing,  using  newgeneration biotechnology.\n\nThe third edition of the awards, on the theme of the circular economy,  began  in  December  2022.  The  aim  is  to  promote circular fashion and identify the most promising innovators in the  fields  of  materials,  product  design  and  business  models. Kering  strengthened  its  collaboration  with  CEIBS  (China Europe International Business School) and Shanghai Fashion Week,  which  are  helping  to  mentor  and  raise  the  profile  of Kering  Generation  Award  winners.  Kering  also  introduced  a new  award,  in  collaboration  with  ChangeNOW:  the  'Kering  x ChangeNOW Award in Responsible Fashion', which was given to  Resortecs:  its  solution,  using  a  heat-dissolvable  stitching thread,  allows  garments  to  be  taken  apart  five  times  more quickly than using traditional methods, and allows up to 90% of the original fabric to be recycled.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They include:\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga's  Material  Innovation  Unit  (MIU),  aiming  to gather  business  lines  (designers,  developers,  operational representatives)  to  converge  toward  common  practices, processes and to brainstorm. MIU is also useful for training teams and putting them in touch with startups, NGOs and experts from the academic world. Topics in 2022 included responsible sourcing, innovative materials and the sharing of best practices;\n- \u00b7 Boucheron's development  of  partnerships with new suppliers that have innovative know-how, and support for historic suppliers in terms of developing new capabilities;\n- \u00b7 Pomellato's collaboration with SIL to study a treatment to keep  silver  from  oxidizing  through  a  surface  deposit  of silica,  and  its  development  of  innovative  new  materials  (a new  white  gold  alloy  that  is  nickel-  and  palladium-free, bioceramics etc.);\n- \u00b7 Kering  Eyewear's  Blockchain  V.I.R.T.U.S  project:  a  system adopting blockchain technology on a regulated platform to measure  and  quantify  the  impacts  of  all  parties  and processes  throughout  production  flows  and  check  that each  link  within  the  chain  is  adhering  to  the  quality standards  and  environmental,  social  and  ethical  practices set by Kering Eyewear;\n- \u00b7 The TextileGenesis pilot  project  led  by  Alexander  McQueen and Balenciaga: mapping the value chain back to the yarn. This project is being managed by the MIL, which has a direct relationship  with  each  selected  supplier,  aiming  to  jointly develop sustainable and innovative solutions.\n\n## 5.4.3 Promote circularity and the reuse of products\n\nThrough its Circularity Ambition, the Group aims to demonstrate that Moving away from the conventional model of  'take-make-waste'is not only about recycling or designing recyclable  products:  it  requires  real  change  in  practices  at each stage of the production cycle.\n\n## 5.4.3.1 Durability by design\n\nThe primary focus of circular fashion is to create products that last,  retain  their  value  over  time  and  to  produce  the  right number of products so as to avoid unsold products.\n\nThe Group's luxury products combine strategic know-how with excellent  craftsmanship  in  processing,  cutting  and  assembly. They are designed and created from unique materials, and are subject  to  rigorous  quality  controls  to  ensure  their  longevity and  durability.  Some  of  the  Houses  offer  their  clients  repair services to maintain the quality of their products and ensure their longevity.\n\nAs part of its commitment, Kering has created specialist repair centers for its clients in China (one in Shanghai and another in  Hong  Kong  SAR)  and  in  the  United  States  (near  its headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey). The aim is to provide a local service and an immediate solution for its clients offering the  same  services  as  those  provided  by  Houses  at  their\n\nIn  2022,  Kering  worked  to  implement  this  ambition  through various tools and  recommendations,  notably  with  the integration  of  a  dedicated  circularity  guide  in  the Kering Standards , which translates the Group's ambition into action.\n\nworkshops, thanks to ultra-modern equipment and qualified craftspeople  who  consider  repairs  to  be  part  of  the  art  of creating.  They  are  specially  trained  by  qualified  Italian technicians to carry out these repairs. During training courses run  by  the  Houses'  workshops  in  Italy,  they  learn  the techniques needed to make a bag or a pair of shoes. Kering already  offers  a  resoling  service  for  sneakers,  and  several Houses have launched pilot programs for shoe cleaning and repairs. Kering's after-sales service helps to build loyalty to the Houses  and  forms  part  of  a  system  designed  to  extend  the lifespan of shoes.\n\nIn addition, the ready-to-wear and leather goods Houses offer a  legal  warranty  as  well  as  a  repair  service  in  the  event  of defects  (a  refund  or  credit  note  may  be  offered  in  some countries).  Brioni  offers  its  clients  a  reconditioning  service, which it promotes via its e-commerce site.\n\n## Focus on: Bottega Veneta's 'Certificate of Craft'\n\nIn  November 2022, Bottega Veneta introduced its Certificate of Craft, lifetime warranty program for its most iconic bags (Jodie, Cassette and Pouch) offering unlimited refresh and repair. This initiative is free for customers, who receive a physical certificate that matches the serial number of their bag.\n\n## 5.4.3.2 Build a business model that gives products a second lease of life\n\nExtending the lifespan of products also means looking for new business  models  that  preserve  the  value  of  the  product  and keep  it  in  the  economy.  As  such,  the  sale  of  second-hand products is growing in importance and is a strategic focus for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Creation of Kering Ventures, with the purpose of investing in  innovative  new  technologies,  brands  and  business\n\nmodels for the future of the luxury sector: financial stake in 2021 in Vestiaire Collective (worldwide pre-owned fashion platform),  Cocoon  (luxury  bag  rental  service),  VitroLabs (startup specializing in the production of lab-grown leather) etc.;\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci has set up a dedicated department for creating new business  models  and  rolling  them  out  on  a  large  scale, particularly in connection  with  gaming,  vintage  and pre-owned fashion as well as rentals (subscription service), as part of a circular economy approach;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 in  2022,  Balenciaga  extended  the  circularity  program  it launched  in  2020  with  pre-owned  fashion  specialist Reflaunt to enhance its impact and allow a larger number of  customers  around  the  world  to  resell  their  Balenciaga garments  and  accessories.  Customers  can  take  their products  to  a  participating  store,  or  arrange  a  scheduled collection.  The  products  are  then  authenticated  and documented. Customers receive a credit that they can use to buy new Balenciaga items in participating stores. There is now  a  section  on  the  House's  website  dedicated  to products resale.\n\n## 5.4.3.3 Reuse, upcycle, recycle\n\nThe  Group's  products  stand  the  test  of  time  both  physically and emotionally, as a result of which they have a long lifespan and  sometimes  several  users,  as  demonstrated  by  Kering's 2020  study,  'Capturing  the  impacts  of  consumer  use  and product end of life in luxury'. This survey of 3,000 customers in  a  number  of  regions  (United  Kingdom,  Italy,  Japan,  United States)  shows  that  products  from  the  Group's  Houses  are usually resold or given to charity or friends.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  accelerated  its  movement  to  collect products that are no longer used by customers, collectively via Extended Producer Responsibility if the organizational structure  is  in  place  locally,  as  is  the  case  in  France  with Refashion, or through  partnerships  such  as  Alexander McQueen x Vestiaire Collective, which offer a practical solution for  collecting  products  that  are  no  longer  used,  while increasing products' active lifespan.\n\nTo  limit  the  quantity  of  unsold  products  at  the  end  of  each season,  the  Group  is  investing  in  artificial  intelligence technologies  to  improve  sales  forecasts  and  therefore optimize  production  and  distribution.  The  machine  learning models  improve  the  Group's  ability  to  anticipate  seasonal demand  and  current  trends,  thereby  reducing  possible prediction errors. Particular attention is paid to items likely to generate  excess  inventory,  in  line  with  the  Group's  circular economy approach.\n\nThe 'circularity' chapter of the Kering Standards sets out the hierarchy  of  waste  treatment  methods.  This  chapter  states that products that are not sold in stores, particularly because of  feedback  about  quality,  are  then  offered  for  sale  through channels  dedicated  to  past  collections,  such  as  outlets  or friends  and  family  sales  for  employees  and  their  families,  or are donated. If products still remain unsold, pilot projects are taking  place  regarding  the  upcycling  or  recycling  of  those items, together with any damaged products.\n\nAs  the  destruction  of  products  or  unsold  items  is  prohibited throughout  the  Group,  Kering  is  actively  working  to  develop operational  recycling  and  upcycling  solutions.  For  example, Bottega  Veneta  established  a  procedure  and  a  dedicated committee  for  managing  unsold  items  in  2019.  These practices  enabled the Group to anticipate France's new antiwaste law, published in 2020, whose Article 35 prohibits the destruction of unsold non-food items from 2022 onward.\n\nBalenciaga, through Kering's SPIRA initiative, is continuing its collaboration  with  a  company  in  France  to  recycle  sneakers; the  collaboration  has  produced  3  metric  tons  of  plastic granules  that  are  then  reused  to  produce  shoe  components. The House has also launched a program with two French NGOs to recycle the used uniforms of store employees in Europe.\n\nTo  support  and  accelerate  the  development  of  industrial recycling infrastructure, Kering has joined Fashion for Good's 'Full  Circle  Textiles  Project:  Scaling  Innovations  in  Cellulosic Recycling'  initiative,  which  aims  to  test  and  eventually  scale up promising chemical recycling technologies.\n\nAll the Houses have developed pilot projects with Revalorem, which  specializes  in  solutions  for  reusing,  repurposing  and recycling  unsold  items  and  raw  materials  for  the  Luxury industry.  For  Boucheron,  the  partnership  aims  to  develop solutions  for  reusing,  repurposing  and  recycling  products, particularly display units and jewelry boxes. Boucheron is also working  with  the  SIL  on  reusing  powder  from  precious  and semi-precious stones.\n\n## 5.4.3.4 Responsible and regenerative sourcing of materials and responsible collections\n\nThe  final  aspect  relates  to  the  sound  management  of chemicals,  the  maximum  use  of  recycled  or  renewable materials,  and  recycling  at  every  stage  of  production.  Kering and its  Houses  have  focused  primarily  on  materials  deemed strategic  by  virtue  of  their  volume,  their  environmental impacts  or  their  importance  in  collections.  Raw  materials aligned with the Kering Standards are traced via the EP&L and account  for  most  of  the  materials  used  in  products  and collections sold by the Houses.\n\nThe  Kering  Standards  allow  the  Group's  Houses  to  identify sourcing  preferences  -  recycled,  biobased  or  certified  -  by material.  In  addition,  the  MIL  provides  Houses'  design  teams with  a  pool  of  sustainable  and  innovative  materials  and assists  them  in  the  selection  of  circular  materials.  However, the  Houses  sometimes  face  technological  challenges,  largely due to the physical properties of recycled materials, which can be  less  efficient  than  virgin  materials.  For  example,  recycled cotton  fibers  are  shorter  and  therefore  more  likely  to  fray, creating  a  conflict  between  product  durability  and  the integration of recycled material.\n\nMoreover,  when  virgin  materials  are  required  to  ensure product  quality,  Kering  devises  projects  to  source  materials produced through regenerative production practices that have minimal  environmental  impact  and  that  guarantee  the renewal of resources.\n\nAs  regards  the  management  of  chemicals,  the  Group's products  are  designed  in  accordance  with  the  Kering Manufacturing  Substance  Restricted  List  (MRSL)  and  the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) to prevent the use of hazardous  chemicals  in  the  manufacturing  process,  ensure that  workers  are  not  exposed  to  hazardous  substances,  and reduce toxic discharges into water (see section 5.3.5.3).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increases the positive impact  of  their  flagship  products  and  thereby  raises  customer  awareness  of  the  issues  at  hand,  meets  growing  demand  for responsible products, and involves customers in the endeavor.\n\n| Houses            | Initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gucci             | \u00b7 Gucci is continuing to add new products to the Off the Grid collection it launched in 2020.

In  2022,  Gucci  became  a  strategic  partner  of  the  Ellen MacArthur  Foundation  to  strengthen  its  circular  economy strategy.\n- \u00b7 Kering  joined  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  de  la  Mode  Circulaire as  a founder  member.  The  federation's  aim  is  to  accelerate discussions between industry participants and governments around the circular economy in the fashion industry.\n- \u00b7 Kering  and  two  of  its  Houses,  as  part  of  a  working  group coordinated by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM),  contributed  to  work  aimed  at  defining  an environmental  labeling  methodology  (data  collection, assessment  method),  as  part  of  the  European  textile strategy and  France's  AGEC  (anti-waste  and  circular economy) Law.\n\n## 5.4.4.1 More sustainable packaging\n\n## Packaging challenges in the luxury industry\n\nIn  2021  and  2022,  Kering  worked  on  a  precise  definition  of what  constitutes  'packaging'  in  relation  to  the  Group's products,  so  that  its  strategy  is  based  on  a  common, transparent  vocabulary.  The  exercise  was  based  on  the definition  contained  in  the  European  Directive  on  packaging and  packaging  waste:  an  item  of  packaging  is  a  disposable article made of any material, intended to contain and protect specific goods and allow them to be handled and transported. As a result, certain items used to protect the Group's products, and  intended  to  be  used  by  customers  throughout  the products' lives, are not categorized as packaging. For example, this is the case for jewelry boxes, eyewear cases, and clothing and shoe dust bags that are not used as disposable items by customers.\n\n## Packaging consumption in 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in metric tons)\n\n|                     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | Change 2022/2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Paper and cardboard | 19,640 | 29,849 | 22,570 | -34%               |\n| Textiles            | 442    | 2,552  | 2,961  | -83%               |\n| Plastics            | 581    | 1,136  | 747    | -49%               |\n| Metals              | 50     | 683    | 517    | -93%               |\n| Wood                | 37     | 219    | 31     | -83%               |\n| Leather             | 0      | 2      | 1      | -100%              |\n| Other materials     | 6      | 63     | -      | -90%               |\n| TOTAL PACKAGING     | 20,756 | 34,504 | 26,827 | -40%               |\n\nThe sharp fall in volumes in 2022 relative to 2021 arose from the new definition of packaging. The reduction in the quantity of textiles, metals, wood and other materials used is due to the reclassification of jewelry boxes, eyewear cases and dust bags, which are now categorized as an integral part of the products in question. However, the reduction in paper volumes is due to the fact that many Houses purchased and stored large volumes of packaging in 2021 after COVID-19 restrictions were eased, and used remaining stocks of packaging in 2022.\n\n## Paper and cardboard packaging\n\nMore than 90% of the packaging used by Kering consists of paper and cardboard. In 2022, all paper and cardboard packaging was certified or recycled.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to promote more sustainable packaging\n\nTo limit the environmental impact of its packaging, Kering and its  Houses make every effort to opt for the most sustainable solutions available made from recycled or certified biobased materials.  They  have  also  adopted  initiatives  aimed  at reducing the use of packaging while guaranteeing an optimal level  of  protection  for  the  goods  manufactured.  A  Kering Standard  dedicated  to  packaging  was  developed  in  2020,\n\nsetting out the eco-design principles that should be applied to packaging in order to improve its environmental impact. The principles revolve around  four aspects of eco-design: reduction  (of  weight  and  volume),  reuse,  recycling  and incorporation  of  sustainable  materials  (recycled,  bio-sourced and  certified).  In  particular,  the  standard  aims  to  eliminate single-use plastics and problematic plastics like PVC.\n\n## Plastic packaging\n\nLess than 3% of the Group's packaging is made of plastic. In 2022, 60% of plastic packaging consisted of recycled or bio-sourced material.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, an eco-design tool was developed to allow teams to assess  packaging  with  respect  to  the  Kering  Standards, identify  new  avenues  for  eco-design  as  regards  packaging (recyclability, reuse etc.) and ensure that it can be recycled in theory.\n\nOrganic or recycled textiles are also favored by the Houses. For example,  the  ribbons  on  Alexander  McQueen  shopping  bags are made from GOTS-certified linen, and its protective apparel bags  are  made  from  GOTS-certified  organic  cotton.  The handles of shopping bags in the Gucci Green Packaging range are made from 100% recycled polyester and can be removed, which makes them easier to recycle.\n\nThe Houses pay special attention to the packaging used for ecommerce.  In  2021  Alexander  McQueen  conducted  a  joint study  with  the  Trecate  logistics  warehouse  into  reducing  ecommerce packaging volumes. Gucci no longer uses plastic in its retail  and  e-commerce  packaging,  which  consists  of reusable  cotton  packaging  and  filling  made  from  FSC  Mix certified paper. Gucci is also cascading its requirements to its suppliers. As regards plastic protective boxes for its accessories, Gucci's Take Back program avoided the production  of  360,000  boxes,  equal  to  44  metric  tons  of plastic avoided for BtoB packaging in 2022.\n\nThe  multi-brand  logistics  hub  aims  to  reduce  the  volume  of packaging used for shipping products worldwide. It works with the  Houses  to  optimize  their  capacity  and  tracks  the performance of packaging used for BtoB transportation. It also ensures compliance with the Kering Standards in this regard. In addition, new machines have been installed in the Group's warehouses to provide made-to-measure packaging for orders of one or more items, reducing both packaging volumes and cardboard use. Warehouse employees are taught not only how to package  goods  correctly,  according  to  the  Houses' requirements,  but  also  how  to  choose  the  best  type  of packaging to optimize volume.\n\n## Single-use plastics\n\nKering  believes  that  eliminating  plastic  packaging  across  the industry  as  a  whole  is  a  priority  and  has  adopted  the ambitious  target  of  eliminating  it  completely  by  2025. To achieve this, the purchasing and sustainability departments have  since  2021  been  leading  a  taskforce  involving  all Houses, whose remit is to adopt joint definitions for BtoC and\n\nBtoB  packaging,  identify  single-use  plastics  within  business lines and implement alternatives through pilots. The solutions being considered are as follows, by order of priority:\n\n## BtoC:\n\n- 1. Eliminate packaging\n- 2. Replace plastic with another material such as paper\n\n## BtoB:\n\n- 1. Eliminate packaging\n- 1. Choose reusable rather than single-use packaging\n- 2. Replace plastic with another material such as paper\n- 3. Use 100% circular plastic:\n- - Containing at least 30% recycled material (with the aim of increasing  that  proportion  to  100%),  with  the  rest consisting of biobased plastic\n- - Recyclable in practice and at scale\n\nBtoB packaging remains the main use of plastic for the Group. Given  the  difficulty  of  completely  removing  plastics  from logistics  because  of  its  requirements  in  terms  of  quality  and protecting articles during handling and transportation, Kering authorizes the uses of 'circular' plastics, i.e. plastics that are made from recycled or biobased materials and can be recycled at  the  end  of  their  lives.  Packaging  may  be  considered recyclable  if  it  is  designed  to  be  recyclable  and  if  collection and recycling networks exist and are operational. Since not all of these networks are at the same level of maturity across the various regions, several studies began in 2022 to gain a better understanding  of  the  systems  and  participants  in  collection and  recycling  networks,  to  ensure  that  packaging  can eventually be recycled.\n\n## 5.4.4.2 Hazardous and non-hazardous waste\n\nWaste  disposal  can  lead  to  a  number  of  environmental outcomes which bring adverse societal impact. The environmental  impacts  of  the  various  approaches  to  waste disposal (recycling, incineration, landfill) can include discharges  into  water  (such  as  leachate),  into  the  air (greenhouse  gases  and  atmospheric  pollution)  and  soil contamination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  2022  EP&L  results  show  that  4%  of  Kering's monetized environmental impacts relate to waste production, and that they are mostly in Tiers 1 and 2 (final assembly and manufacturing) of its supply chains.\n\n## Hazardous and non-hazardous waste\n\nAs  is  the  case  for  the  consumption  of  packaging,  the production  of  waste  in  the  Group's  operations  is  directly related to the intensity of its retail activities. The repackaging of  goods  and  the  use  of  pallets  for  transportation  mostly generate  non-hazardous  waste.  Kering  mainly  generates packaging  waste  and  also  small  quantities  of  hazardous waste, corresponding to specific items of waste on production sites  and  other  waste  produced  mainly  in  stores  and  offices (lighting, ink cartridges, etc.).",

        "page_content": "The main source of the Group's hazardous waste production is its  industrial  operations,  and  more  specifically  its  tanneries. One  of  the  main  challenges  for  Kering's  waste  management operations  is  the  presence  of  heavy  metals,  which  are  used during  the  tanning  process.  Kering's  tanneries  are  therefore actively involved  in  the  research  and  development  of alternative  tanning  methods  that  are  more  environmentally friendly. As a result, a heavy metal-free tanning method is now available  at  the  Group's  exotic  and  non-exotic  leather tanneries and lifecycle assessments have been carried out to\n\nconfirm the improvement in environmental impact associated with the new process, which does not use chromium or heavy metals.\n\nTanning processes can also give rise to odor pollution because they  emit  hydrogen  sulfide,  especially  at  the  stripping  stage. Unpleasant odors are managed by an air evacuation system at the stripping tubs, which channels polluted air through a filter that traps sulfur-bearing particles and outputs clean air.\n\n## Total waste produced in 2022, 2021 and 2020 and 2022/2021 change (in metric tons)\n\n|                                 | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | Change 2022/2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Non-hazardous waste             | 22,702 | 20,452 | 16,837 | 11%                |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 65%    | 77%    | 72%    |                    |\n| Hazardous waste  (1)            | 569    | 645    | 573    | -12%               |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 43%    | 46%    | 41%    |                    |\n| TOTAL WASTE                     | 23,271 | 21,097 | 17,410 | 10%                |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 64%    | 76%    | 71%    |                    |\n\nIn  2022,  98%  of  the  waste  generated  by  the  Group  was non-hazardous.  The  quantity  of  waste  produced  rose  by around 10% in 2022, which is consistent with the increase in the  Group's  business  levels.  Waste  consisting  of  pallets  and wood  increased  by  32%,  particularly  in  warehouses  and industrial  sites,  while  paper  waste  fell  by  12%  and  plastic waste by 18%.\n\nThe proportion of non-hazardous waste that was recycled and upgraded fell  to  64%  in  2022.  That  was  mainly  due  to  more conservative  assumptions  being  used  in  2022:  where  there was  no  end-of-life  information  about  the  waste  generated, it was assumed that it would go to landfill.\n\n## Waste recycling\n\nKering  is  constantly  looking  for  ways  of  recycling  the  waste generated by its  operations.  Paper  and  packaging  have  been collected and recycled at its offices for a number of years.\n\n## Waste recycling rate in 2022 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2011, Balenciaga adopted waste sorting at its main sites in Paris. The House works with an ESAT (a company that supports people  with  disabilities  to  help  them  integrate  into  the mainstream  labor  market  in  France)  that  specializes  in  the recovery  and  recycling  of  conventional  office  waste  (paper, envelopes, flyers, etc.), as well as cardboard, plastic and fabric (such as scraps from the brand's studio and workshops).\n\nIn line with each country's regulations, Gucci also ensures the appropriate  management  of  waste  from  its  stores,  giving priority  to  the  separation  and  recycling  of  key  components such as paper, cardboard and plastic.\n\nIn 2022, Saint Laurent continued its work on a comprehensive recycling  program at its  industrial  sites,  headquarters,  stores and  showrooms.  The  House  also  maintained  its  numerous partnerships with social impact companies, such as Emma\u00fcs offshoot Le Relais, for all used  fabrics  and  uniforms. Saint Laurent equips its sites - particularly its headquarters using recycled materials such as insulation panels made using fabrics from old collections.\n\nOn the basis of a circular economy-led approach, a number of other  partnerships  have  been  established  in  order  to  find sustainable solutions for recycling and reusing waste relating to  production  activities,  in  particular  textiles  (see  section 5.4.3.3).\n\nThese  measures  are  helping  to  achieve  the  target  of  zero waste  at  the  Group's  offices.  Various  initiatives  were  also trialed and rolled out between 2020 and 2022 at the Group's and  Balenciaga's  headquarters  in  Paris  and  at  Saint  Laurent, such as the collection of single-use face masks for recycling, the adoption of a deposit return system for packaging at the Company  canteen  with La Consigne  Greengo , and  the introduction of Auum, an innovative machine that cleans and disinfects cups in 10 seconds without chemicals.\n\nMeasures are also being taken on a local level to combat food waste,  such  as  Balenciaga  and  Saint  Laurent's  partnerships with  waste  and  compost  recovery  specialists Linkee and Les Alchimistes , particularly  in  relation  to  showroom  events. Gucci's has  been  involved  in  the Siticibo initiative in collaboration  with Banco  Alimentare since  2011,  which  also partners  with  Pomellato  and  Dodo,  and  Bottega  Veneta  is involved in the Food for People project .\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2022, La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts carried out 24 collection processes for the Group's Houses (18  in  2021),  and  the  reuse  rate  was  78.8%.  While supporting the cultural and creative sector, the association extends  the  lifespan  of  the  materials  through  their  reuse and  helps  reduce  waste  from  the  sector.  Balenciaga  also continued  with  its  partnership  with La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts , particularly  in  relation  to  the  annual  stock-take  at  its warehouse in the Paris region.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Kering signed a partnership with M.E.TA ,  an Italian organization that also repurposes business materials. This partnership  aims  to  devise  guidelines  and  share  best practice  regarding  design  in  the  Italian  fashion  industry, and allows Kering to further realize its circularity ambition while also working with local organizations.\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  and  Balenciaga  -  for  shoes  -  along  with Alexander  McQueen  and  Bottega  Veneta  have  developed pilot  projects  with  Revalorem,  which  offers  solutions  for reusing,  repurposing  and  recycling  unsold  items  for  the luxury industry. In 2021, Alexander McQueen also launched a  pilot  project  with  FastFeet  Grinded  to  take  apart  and evaluate  the  recyclability  of  400  pairs  of  unsellable sneakers. Most of the materials obtained from this process can be reused as raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent  made  several  donations  to  NGOs  and  fashion schools  during  the  year,  and  organized  private  sales  for employees  to  give  a  second  life  to  fabrics  from  previous collections,  visual  merchandizing  tools  and  benches  used during fashion shows. Balenciaga is continuing its partnership  with  Le  Relais,  a  member  of  the  Emma\u00fcs network  that  works  to  promote  reintegration  through  the employment  of  vulnerable  people,  for  collecting  and recycling textiles. More than 30 metric tons of textiles have been  recycled  since  2018  and  transformed  into  an environmentally friendly building insulation material known as M\u00e9tisse.\n- \u00b7 With  support  from  the  MIL,  Gucci  has  established  an ambitious  collection  and  recycling  program  for  ECONYL\u00ae offcuts.  Known  as  the  'ECONYL\u00ae-Gucci  pre-consumer fabric take back program', it aims to maximize the benefits of this innovative material in Gucci's ready-to-wear collections.  The  program  relies  on  the  cooperation  of Gucci's suppliers to collect ECONYL\u00ae production offcuts and re-inject  them  into  the  ECONYL\u00ae  regeneration  process  in order to re-create a high-quality yarn, which is reused in the production of Gucci ready-to-wear collections.\n- \u00b7 At  the  end  of  2022,  12  tanneries  were  taking  part  in  the Gucci Scrap-less project. The project consists of cutting off parts  of  hides  or  skins  that  cannot  be  used  in  finished products due to their size or quality before tanning actually takes  place.  The  outcome  over  the  period  from  2018  to 2022  was  a  greatly  reduced  environmental  impact, achieved by reducing the amount of leather needing to be tanned (253 tonnes of scrap leather avoided). In turn, this meant lower carbon emissions (23.8 tCO2 avoided), as well as reduced a reduction in the use of water (32 million liters of  water  saved),  chemicals  (reduction  of  453  metric  tons, including  77  metric  tons  of  chromium)  and  energy  (2.6 million kW), and a lower impact from transportation.\n- \u00b7 In  a  similar  vein,  Gucci-Up  is  a  circular  economy  initiative aimed  at  promoting  the  upcycling  of  leather  and  textile offcuts generated during the production process, developed in collaboration  with  social  NGOs  and  cooperatives. The  project  began  in  2018  and  saw  76  metric  tons processed  between  2018  and  2022.  In  addition,  45,000 meters  of  fabric  was  donated  to  social  cooperatives  in 2022. Within this framework, Gucci has also set up a textile scraps  recycling  program  with  Green  Line,  an  Italian company that specializes in the collection and recycling of fabric scraps. Between 2018 and 2022, 697 metric tons of scraps were recycled under this project, in which Brioni also participates.\n\nSeveral Houses have also established leather scrap management systems (see section 5.3.3.2).\n\n## 5.4.4.3 Paper consumption: printed publications and office paper\n\nThe  paper  consumed  by  Kering  and  its  Houses  comes  from two main sources:\n\n- \u00b7 indirect  purchases  of  paper  ordered  by  service  providers outside  the  Group  (printers  and  agencies)  for  printing communication media such as reports, posters, mailshots and point-of-sale advertising;\n- \u00b7 office paper.\n\n## Paper consumption in 2022\n\nA breakdown of Kering's paper consumption by category is presented below.\n\n## Paper consumption in 2022, 2021 and 2020 and 2022/2021 change ( in metric tons )\n\n|                            |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Paper - indirect purchases |    304 | 713    | 771    | -57%     |\n| Office paper               |    569 | 521    | 830    | 9%       |\n| TOTAL PAPER                |    873 | 1,234  | 1,601  | -29%     |",

This confirms the efforts made by the Houses to  reduce  their  paper  consumption  through  a  shift  to paperless  documents  and  digital  technology  as  a  result  of ongoing remote working practices.\n\nIn  2022, the proportion of certified (PEFC or FSC) or recycled paper was 74% for the Group, decreasing compared to 2021. As  with  waste  recycling,  this  was  due  to  the  use  of conservative  assumptions  in  2022:  where  there  was  no information about the source of paper, it was assumed that it was not certified or recycled.\n\n## Types of paper used in 2022 ( % )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6 COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE\n\n## 6.1 Crafting tomorrow's Luxury\n\n## 6.1.1 Raising awareness among employees and informing clients\n\nBroadly  speaking,  Kering's  strategy  is  to  change  the  way  in which products are designed at the earliest possible stage and subsequently  at  every  step  of  the  value  chain  (processing, production), from creation and design to the customer, as part of  a  circularity  approach.  Raw  materials  aligned  with  the Kering Standards are traced via the EP&L and now account for most of the materials used in products and collections sold by the Houses (see section 5.3.3). In addition to product design and the sourcing of raw materials, it is also essential to take action and raise awareness of sustainability issues concerning its products.\n\nWith this in mind, the Group and its Houses are stepping up internal training and awareness-raising operations, particularly  for  their  sales,  design  and  merchandizing  teams, as  well  as  increasing  interactions  with  customers  and consumers.\n\n## Training and raising awareness among employees\n\nKering and its Houses have developed a range of training and awareness-raising  initiatives,  and  regularly  share  news  and updates on internal projects:\n\n- \u00b7 dedicated  awareness-raising  and  training  sessions  during the induction process for all new employees at Kering and its Houses;\n- \u00b7 sharing  of  updates  and  news  on  the  Group's  and  Houses' sustainability  projects  via  the  Group's  corporate  social media platforms;\n- \u00b7 quarterly  challenges  on  the  dedicated  digital  platform  for employees, The Kering Planet;\n- \u00b7 inclusion of sustainability topics in the compulsory annual Ethics  &  Compliance  training  for  all  Group  employees around the world.\n\n## Focus on: Launch of the Sustainability Academy\n\nIn  November  2022,  Kering  launched  the  Sustainability  Academy  -  an  online  space  providing  training  on  sustainability matters - for all its employees. The first training module helps people understand the forces that drive climate change and the impact it may have on companies and society more broadly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A Climate Fresk workshop was also organized for Kering's Luxury Committee, notably composed of the Executive Committee and the CEOs of its Houses.\n- \u00b7 An online seminar took place around Earth Day in April to raise awareness among Alexander McQueen employees about issues related to biodiversity, circular economy and the importance of developing regenerative agriculture in fighting climate change.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga 's Sustainability Days give its employees the chance to take part in practical initiatives such as beach cleans and efforts to raise awareness of ocean plastics pollution, as well as clothing collections at head office and in the regions as part of Charity Days in September 2022. The House also organized 14 Climate Fresk sessions, which attracted 250 participants at head office, as well as a session raising awareness of its partnership with the World Food Program.\n- \u00b7 In-house sustainability weeks organized twice per year by Boucheron .\n- \u00b7 International Volunteer Day dedicated to the Gucci Changemakers volunteering program.\n- \u00b7 Two Gucci Fireside Chats took place on the House's internal social media platform in connection with International Women's Day (May), dealing with gender equality and with the Pride Month (June). For this second session, internal and external participants underlined the importance of self-expression and gender equality in helping our society to advance.\n- \u00b7 In-house events (videos and webinars) were organized by Kering Eyewear , Pomellato and Dodo during awareness-raising days, such as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.\n- \u00b7 Partnership with the No\u00e9 association to protect butterflies at the Laennec site\n- \u00b7 Gucci Education is an e-learning platform launched by Gucci for its corporate employees, covering topics such as diversity, inclusion and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent offers all its employees sustainability training comprising three modules on its in-house E-University platform. A new retail module to address customers' most common sustainability questions was introduced in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga organized monthly in-person or remote training sessions in 2022 for several teams, to raise their awareness of sustainability matters. The House also has a Material Innovation Unit dedicated to sustainable innovation for designers and developers.\n- \u00b7 Kering Standards training is provided to salespeople and employees with key roles - such as design, retail and merchandising teams - as well as product office teams (Brioni) and management teams.\n- \u00b7 Training for retail teams (particularly at Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Boucheron and Gucci)\n- \u00b7 Gucci Retail Academy : the House's internal training platform through which it provides specific training modules for its sales personnel worldwide, taken by over 90% of the employees concerned. In particular, these modules explain the environmental benefits of products that feature sustainable materials, along with the House's People & Planet commitments.\n- \u00b7 Creation of a network of 400 sustainability ambassadors in Balenciaga stores, working to reduce the impact of retail sites and to raise awareness of the matter in-house. At the same time, a performance rating system was set up to monitor each store's commitment to sustainability around the world, based on criteria such as leadership, awareness-raising and waste sorting.\n\n## Measuring the footprint of products\n\nKering  takes  part  in  work  and  methodological  discussions regarding  environmental  labeling  to  consumers,  particularly via the work done by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la  Mode as  part  of  its  European  PEF  (Product  Environmental Footprint) project. In 2022, preparations for the implementation  of  article  13  of  France's  AGEC  Law  included developing  a  data  collection  system  in  order  to  display  the environmental information required by the Law to consumers at the time of purchase. The information displayed relates to matters  such  as  the  recycled  content  of  products  and packaging, their recyclability and the traceability of materials. In 2023, only Gucci and Balenciaga will be concerned by these rules in relation to their products.\n\nKering's  Houses  are  increasingly  intent  on  measuring  and monitoring  the  performance  of  their  collections  in  terms  of\n\nsustainability. Saint Laurent, for example, has developed a set of indicators for tracking the performance of its ready-to-wear categories twice a year with its development teams.\n\nIn 2022, Bottega Veneta continued developing its Green Atelier , an  integrated  system  for  monitoring  the  sustainability performance of  its  materials  and  suppliers,  and  therefore  of its  products.  The  system  allows  the  House  to  assess  all ready-to-wear,  leather  goods  and  shoes  collections  across five criteria: traceability of materials, compliance  with sustainability standards, environmental impact, social performance and the quality of suppliers' chemical management  processes.  The Green  Atelier uses  a  number  of interfaces  that  allow  results  to  be  shared  widely  in-house, including an app installed on the phones of Bottega Veneta's employees,  which  shows  each  product's  performance  and strengths.",

Balenciaga  and  Saint  Laurent  have  developed  dedicated content for their in-house retail apps.\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  Boucheron  published  its  first Precious  for  the Future impact  report  aimed  at  sharing  its  sustainability vision and strategy. The report focuses on three aspects where,  how  and  who  -  and  explores  the  House's  new sourcing,  operational  and  creative  methods,  in  harmony with its  ecosystem.  Gucci  published  the  second  edition  of its Gucci Equilibrium report , which complements the content on its dedicated website and Instagram profile.\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga  formed  a  partnership  with  Reforestum,  raising awareness  among  e-commerce  customers  about  the impact of their purchases by funding environmental assets (carbon credits or Forest Shares). These assets correspond to  the  impact  (in  terms  of  CO2  emissions)  of  products purchased, and support forest and/or biodiversity restoration/protection projects, as well as the development of local carbon sinks.\n\nIn 2022, Kering also published a Practical Guide to Environmental  Claims  as  part  of  the  Kering  Standards, designed  to provide support to its Houses and to avoid any risk of potential greenwashing statements. The guide sets out the kind of information that should be provided: according to best  practice  guides  on  green  claims,  for  a  claim  to  be  fully responsible  and  trustworthy  it  must  be:  true  and  relevant, clear and  unambiguous,  fair  and  without  exaggeration, substantiated and verifiable,  not  over-using  visual  natural  or nature-like  elements,  and  putting  forward  certifications properly.\n\nFinally, the Charter on working relations with fashion models and their  well-being,  published  in  2017  by  Kering  and  LVMH and applied to all of their brands, promotes high standards of integrity, responsibility and  respect  toward  the  people concerned.  As  well  as  paying  particular  attention  to  models' working  conditions,  this  Charter  forms  part  of  the  Group's responsible  communication  efforts,  aiming  to  promote respect for the dignity of all people and to convey a positive image  to  the  audiences  of  the  Group's  various  Houses, particularly among vulnerable groups.\n\nGucci has a set of responsible marketing and communication guidelines  that  set  out  the  procedures  that  should  be implemented before and during photo shoots, fashion shows and  other  events  and  initiatives,  such  as  the  creation  of promotional materials and more generally any photographic/ audiovisual material produced or used by Gucci.\n\n## 6.1.2 Green fashion shows: rethinking fashion shows and managing event footprints\n\nFashion  shows  are  an  essential  part  of  the  operations  of Kering's  Houses,  enabling  them to share their creative vision and  present  new  collections.  They  also  provide  a  unique opportunity  to  raise  awareness  about  sustainability,  and  to mobilize  all  the  parties  involved  (brands,  model  agencies, event organizers, media, etc.) around this important topic.\n\nIn  2019,  all  of  the  Houses  took  up  the  Green  Fashion  Shows internal  guidelines  on  minimizing  the  environmental  impact of  fashion  shows,  while  allowing  the  creative  directors  to express  their  artistic  potential.  The  topics  covered  by  the guidelines  include  governance,  stakeholder  relations,  energy management,  waste  management,  elimination  of  single-use plastics, catering and transportation. The associated specifications  cover  the  before,  during  and  after  phases  of each event. Since 2020, the safety department has carried out procedures to check that the charter is applied in each show. These procedures were reinforced in 2022.\n\nThe Houses' efforts to minimize the overall footprint of their fashion  shows  include  reducing  and  recycling  waste;  reusing or upgrading stage materials (wood, steel, synthetic materials, carpets,  seating,  etc.);  using  compostable  crockery;  reducing and optimizing the transportation of empoyees, merchandise and equipment; and offsetting the carbon footprint of events via REDD+ certified projects. Partnerships are also formed with various  local  non-profits  and  organizations  to  collect  and redistribute  materials  at  the  Group  level  (with R\u00e9serve  des Arts ),  as  well  as  equipment  and  leftover  food  (Gucci  with EcoSet).\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga has been working with NGO  Up2Green Reforestation and supporting a project based in the Indian province  of  Gujarat  to  offset  greenhouse  gas  emissions related to its physical shows. In 2022, Balenciaga funded a second project via the same NGO in Senegal to promote the use  of  green  energy  to  combat  deforestation  and  climate change through the production of biochar.\n- \u00b7 As  part  of  the  Group  partnership,  Balenciaga  and  Saint Laurent  work  with La  R\u00e9serve  des  Arts for  their  fashion shows, as do Gucci and Alexander McQueen for their Paris shows.\n- \u00b7 Gucci  obtained  ISO  20121  certification  for  its  advertising campaigns  and  shows,  both  physical  (such  as  Gucci  Love Parade)  and  virtual.  The  ISO  20121  standard  examines environmental,  social  and  economic  factors  to  determine whether  an  event  can  qualify  as  sustainable,  and  Gucci's compliance  was  verified  by  Bureau  Veritas.  In  addition  to the Group's Charter for fashion shows, Gucci applies its own standards - the Gucci Guidelines for Sustainable Events - to all its events. The House also measures the environmental impact  of  all  its  shows,  verified  by  an  independent  thirdparty organization. The impact is then offset via projects in Gucci's Natural Climate Solutions Portfolio .\n- \u00b7 Alexander McQueen uses a local network of subcontractors for its London shows, and favors the use of green energy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2022,  with  the  aim  of  getting  its  Houses'  shows  to  take  a more  circular  approach,  Kering  formed  a  partnership  with M.E.TA, an Italian organization that upcycles business materials,  to  create  guidelines  and  share  best  practice regarding  the  eco-design  of  fashion  shows.  The  partnership will also create a traceability system for materials along with the  performance  indicators  needed  to  ensure  circularity  as regards the sets used in shows. Gucci has so far sent M.E.TA 17 tonnes  of  materials  as  part  of  their  collaboration,  while Bottega Veneta has also worked with M.E.TA to reuse materials from various events around the world.\n\nKering also takes part in working groups on this topic, set up by  fashion  industry  associations  and  non-profit  organization Paris  Good  Fashion .  In  particular,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have worked with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and all  the  parties  involved  in  putting  on  a  fashion  show,  to develop a tool for measuring the various environmental, social and  economic  impacts  of  such  events.  This  tool  is  in operation for all Houses holding shows in Paris. It factors in all the operations involved, including digital and media impact.\n\n## 6.1.3 Product compliance and consumer health and safety\n\nKering is committed to helping raise awareness of sustainability issues among consumers, while ensuring that its products respect both their health and the environment.\n\nTo enable customers to enjoy the products developed by the Houses  safely,  Kering  has  defined  a  set  of  quality  and compliance control procedures that comply with the strictest international  consumer  health,  safety  and  environmental standards and regulations, such as REACH, US CPSIA, China GB Standards  and  Japan  Industrial  Standards  (JIS).  The  Product Compliance Advisory department aims to pool services, for the purpose  of  advising  and  supporting  the  Houses  on  product development and the various stages of production, including product testing protocols to ensure that products comply with the  local  characteristics  of  each  market.  The  department publishes  the  Product  Restricted  Substance  List  (PRSL)  and Product  Safety  Requirements,  an  internal  document  listing substances to be removed and thresholds not to be exceeded, as  well  as  requirements  in  terms  of  product  safety.  To  take into  account  the  pace  of  technological  development  and progress  in  chemical  research,  the  PRSL  is  updated  at  least once a year. In particular, it has specific modules for products intended  for  children  in  terms  of  managing  chemical substances and safety. Specific training sessions are provided each year.\n\n## Focus on: the Test & Innovation Lab (TIL)\n\nIn 2021, Kering strengthened its product testing system by opening its Test & Innovation Lab (TIL) in Prato (Italy), a facility that supports Kering's Houses (and external clients) with testing, the resolution of problems and R&D projects. As well as quality and regulatory controls, the TIL also tests innovative materials and identifies solutions to potential problems that the  Houses  may encounter in the various phases of production. The TIL has ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation from Accredia, covering over 250 testing methods in 2022 for both raw materials and finished products.\n\nIn 2022,  the  Product  Compliance  Advisory  Department continued its activities in the following areas:\n\n- 1. Strengthen compliance controls: regular audits of product compliance  were  conducted  at  the  warehouse  level together with the Houses to detect potential non-compliance. Relations with laboratories accredited to carry  out  tests  and  measurements  were  maintained  to cover  the  growing  number  of  non-core  products  (food contact  materials,  toys,  electrical/electronic  devices). Since  March  2021,  the  TIL  has  been  carrying  out  testing activities  and  providing  support  for  Houses  to  ensure product compliance;\n- 2. Improve knowledge-sharing on product compliance processes: training programs have been strengthened and extended  to  all  key  departments  (product  development, production, quality and purchasing), from raw materials to production  (leather,  fabric  and  metal  accessories)  and testing.  In  2022,  around  20  training  sessions  were\n\norganized, attended by over 500 employees. The sessions dealt with key aspects of production processes, compliance  requirements  and  the  related  tests  and controls. The department also adopted specific guidelines covering  the  most  important  subjects  regarding  product compliance.  Due  to  the  increasing  complexity  of  the Houses'  products  and  new  environmental  regulations  on packaging,  major  efforts  are  made  to  ensure  maximum accuracy in labeling;\n\n- 3. Support the product development teams: in collaboration with  the  Chinese  authorities,  company-specific  product standards  have  been  established  for  Kering's  Houses. These  standards  already  existed  for  handbags,  wallets, shoes and belts. They make it possible to develop pieces that meet all requirements in terms of health, safety and compliance,  while  leaving  the  Houses'  creative  teams significant  scope  to  follow  their  inspiration.  In  2021, Kering took the initiative  to  develop  a  draft  standard  for unregulated product categories in China.",

        "page_content": "Kering's  Customs  &  Trade  Compliance  department  is  also tasked  with  optimizing  the  Houses'  global  distribution  flows from  the  regulatory  and  procedural  perspective  around  the world. This activity consists mainly of analyzing requirements and  laws  relating  to  customs  and  compliance  in  destination countries  for  new  products  and  projects,  working  with  local logistics  teams  and  external  experts  as  required.  By  working with  the  Customs  &  Trade  Compliance  Department  from  the early  stages  of  development,  Houses  can  prevent  risks, penalties and delays, and ensure that the distribution chain is fully  compliant.  Once  requirements  have  been  defined,  the Customs  &  Trade  Compliance  Department  is  tasked  with pulling together and sharing product-related information and documents with regional logistics teams, brokers and clients; checking the consistency of product Master Data managed by the  Houses'  production  departments  and  taking  steps  to correct  potential  errors;  managing  product  certifications  and supplier  audits  by  following  the  standards  established  by international certification authorities; and  implementing appropriate  compliance  procedures,  often  by  directing  other Group  entities.  In  2022,  the  department  dealt  with  almost 48,000 internal requests.\n\nThe  Group  also  has  a  Multi  Brand  After  Sales  Department, dealing  with  quality  assurance  for  products  after  they  have been  sold,  in  accordance  with  House  standards  as  regards value-added services (VASs). The department also implements and manages activities related to product returns from stores to the Group's distribution centers and warehouses. Activities include  repair  management,  product  checks,  on-demand audits,  re-labeling  and  the  hallmarking  process  for  jewelry. The  department  is  a  single  point  of  contact  for  the  Houses, regardless of where the product is located in the world.\n\nSome Houses also carry out specific work related to regulatory compliance  in  respect  of  hazardous  substances  and  the implementation  of  the  PRSL  and  MRSL  (see  section  5.3.5.3). Houses including Boucheron, Pomellato and Dodo also ensure that  their  products  conform  to  the  REACH  regulation,  while Qeelin also carries out chemical tests on its natural stones to ensure  compliance  with  European  Union  standards.  Lastly, Kering  Eyewear  uses  accredited  laboratories  with  specific expertise in eyewear for its compliance checks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The aims of this policy include raising awareness among designers and future fashion industry leaders regarding the major social and  environmental  challenges  they  will  face.  Details  of  the main partnerships are provided in section 3.1.2.\n\nIn addition, and in order to ensure that top-level expertise is maintained  and  promoted  within  their  business  activities, certain Houses are developing dedicated training centers and local  partnerships.  These  professional  organizations  help  to ensure the survival of some very demanding and unique skills, and  support  long-term  employment  in  the  regions  where these crafts originated.

The center's purpose is to preserve the unique know-how  developed by Gucci and to instill technological innovation in order to optimize production, a key factor  underpinning the House's growth. Within the  Gucci ArtLab,  the  \u00c9cole de l'Amour  education program was  created, which includes a craftsmanship school (Scuola dei Mestieri), offering a six-month program to train  students to professional standards; a factory school (Scuola di Fabbrica), which trains operators in leather  production techniques; and the Artlab academy and factory (Accademia Artlab e Fabbriche), an ongoing in- house training program that aims to meet the specific training needs of people in various roles and working in various production units within Gucci. |\n| Saint Laurent   | In 2022, in partnership with the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode (IFM), Saint Laurent continued its  Saint Laurent  Couture Institute  program in order to preserve and pass on Saint Laurent's unique expertise and generate new  ideas for the future. This six-month high-end training program consists of several modules in the ready-to-wear  category, combining academic learning, a core syllabus exploring the House's iconic pieces, and on-the-job  learning with the focus on creativity and craftsmanship. It gives around 15 students the chance to develop  their skills and learn about fashion. Saint Laurent employees also take part in this program, in which  innovation and sustainability play a central role.

At the same time, a digital campaign was designed to launch the initiative in China, while  several of Marie Claire's international editorial teams covered the program in their countries,  including the United States, Greece and the United Kingdom. |\n| November | Participation in  COP27,  the 27th United Nations climate change conference (Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt). | Participation in  COP27,  the 27th United Nations climate change conference (Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| December | Participation in  COP15,  the 15th United Nations biodiversity conference (Montreal, Canada).         | Participation in  COP15,  the 15th United Nations biodiversity conference (Montreal, Canada).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|          |                                                                                                       | Launch of the  Climate Fund for Nature  with Mirova and the L'OCCITANE Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\nThroughout the year, the Kering sustainability team spoke to a diverse  range  of  audiences  about  the  Group's  strategy  and initiatives.

It  takes part in a number of initiatives involving business and industryspecific associations. Kering's contributions to these associations  are  determined  according  to  budgets  that  are either fixed or vary according to the Houses' revenue.\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  allocated  \u20ac1,496,295  to  institutional affairs worldwide in 2022, including \u20ac1,226,520 of contributions  to  business  and  industry-specific  associations. The main contributions were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac383,000  to  the Camera  Nazionale  della  Moda  Italiana , which is helping to develop a responsible fashion industry in Italy;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac221,674 to Confindustria , which represents Italian companies and helps drive their exports;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac174,266 to the Comit\u00e9 Colbert , which promotes the Luxury industry  and  its  specific  features  with  respect  to  public authorities in France and Europe.\n\nOf  that  total,  \u20ac269,775  was  spent  on  lobbying,  solely  via organizations  of  which  the  Group  is  a  member.  This expenditure is intended to encourage the sustainable growth of  the  Luxury  industry,  and  is  entirely  consistent  with  the Group's Sustainability strategy.\n\nIn line with Kering's Code of Ethics, no financial contributions were made in 2022 in the name or on behalf of the Group to any political organization in exchange for any direct or indirect material, commercial or personal advantage.\n\nThe amount allocated to institutional affairs breaks down as follows:\n\n| In euros                                                                   | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Lobbying or similar                                                        | 269,775   |\n| Funding of political organizations                                         | 0         |\n| Contributions (business or industry-specific  associations,  think tanks ) | 1,226,520 |\n| Other                                                                      | 0         |\n| TOTAL                                                                      | 1,496,295 |\n| Scope                                                                      | 100%      |\n\n## 6.3 Initiatives carried out by the Kering Foundation and sponsorship programs\n\n## 6.3.1 The Kering Foundation is increasing its impact combating violence against women by supporting ambitious, cross-discipline projects in France and abroad\n\nWorldwide,  one  in  three  women  is  or  will  be  a  victim  of violence  in  her  life,  regardless  of  her  background,  culture  or social class. In 2008, based on its belief that companies have a vital  role  to  play  in  addressing  the  issue  alongside  public authorities and NGOs, Kering launched the Kering Foundation, which  is  dedicated  to  combating  violence  against  women. The  Foundation  operates  according  to  a  five-year  program, with  Kering  providing  funding  of  \u20ac10  million  (\u20ac2  million  per year).\n\nTo  create  real  impact,  the  Foundation  works  with  local partners  on  a  long-term  basis  in  six  countries:  Mexico,  the United  States,  France,  Italy,  the  United  Kingdom  and  China. The Foundation's work focuses on three aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 improving care for women who are victims of violence by supporting local non-profit organizations;\n- \u00b7 changing  behaviors  and  attitudes  to  end  the  cycle  of violence, particularly by involving boys and men;\n- \u00b7 taking collective action to eradicate violence by creating a working  environment  in  which  women  who  have  suffered violence feel safe, and encouraging other companies to join the combat.\n\n## 6.3.1.1 Comprehensive, adapted support for women victims of violence\n\nThe  Kering  Foundation  has  always  worked  with  local  and national organizations whose programs put women survivors of violence at the center of their actions, providing them with tailored support.\n\nIn the United States, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, the Foundation  continues  to  work  with  a  number  of  specialist organizations: the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV),  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Nationale  Solidarit\u00e9  Femmes (FNSF), Donne in Rete contro la violenza (D.i.Re),  and Women's Aid .  In 2022, the Foundation pursued its approach by forming a new partnership  with  the Red  Nacional  de  Refugios (RNR),  a Mexican non-profit consisting of 75 spaces that welcome and protect women  and  their  children.  Support  for  these organizations  comes  in  the  form  of  unrestricted  funding, enabling them to increase their capabilities for taking action in the most efficient way.\n\nThe  Foundation  also  supports  pilot  initiatives  such  as La Maison des femmes de Saint-Denis , which opened in 2016. This unique  venue  provides  women  with  a  full  range  of  support, meeting their medical, psychological, emotional and material needs  with  the  help  of  60  professionals  (medics,  social workers, lawyers etc.).",

        "page_content": "## Focus on: the Re#Start collective\n\nThis innovative model developed by La Maison des femmes de Saint-Denis has a proven track record in terms of impact and value added. This is why the Kering Foundation is taking action, alongside the public authorities and other relevant partners, to roll out similar venues acrossFrance through the Re#Start Collective, which brings together organizations that care for and support women who are victims of violence. Launched in 2021, this collective is sponsored by \u00c9lisabeth Moreno, French Minister  Delegate  for  Gender  Equality,  Diversity  and  Equal  Opportunities  between  2020  and  2022,  and  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Kering  and  Chairman  of  the  Kering  Foundation.  During  the  Generation Equality  Forum  2021  convened  by UN  Women ,  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  announced  that  Kering,  via  its  Foundation  and together with the French government, would provide \u20ac1 million of funding per year for five years to support the opening of 15 centers in France based on the Maison des Femmes de Saint-Denis model. In 2022, Kering supported the opening of La Maison des femmes de Marseille in January and the structuring of La Maison des femmes de Rennes ,  which is scheduled to open in  2023.  At La  Maison  des  femmes \u00e0  Marseille,  1,700  medical,  psychological  and  social  consultations  have  already taken place to support 380 women survivors of violence.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Kering  Foundation  works  with  social  entrepreneurs  that  take  innovative  approaches  to  combating  violence against  women.  It  has  thus  set  up  a  'Social  Entrepreneur  Community',  which  aims  to  develop  synergies  between  these entrepreneurs in different sectors and countries, in order to increase their impact. Members of the Community receive financial support from the Kering Foundation, follow an incubation program and take part in annual workshops. The Community currently has nine members, including Colori Vivi, Chayn, Gendes, Las Panas and du Pain & des Roses .\n\n## Colori Vivi , Italy\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018\n- \u00b7 Supporting female refugees and providing them with training through its Made in Italy tailoring workshop\n- \u00b7 Participants receive guidance from qualified volunteer tailors and stylists, who teach them the principles of making quality clothing and accessories. Colori Vivi has so far provided jobs to seven vulnerable women, while four women are currently undergoin training\n\n## Chayn, United Kingdom\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018\n- \u00b7 Supporting women survivors of violence by providing easy-to-access interactive online resources in 12 languages.\n- \u00b7 In the last nine years, over 500,000 women and users have accessed Chayn's resources, with 1.5 million page views. In 2022, the organization broadened its audience by offering remote classes and a chat facility in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi..\n\nThe  Foundation  continued  to  support  other  pilot  projects, including  the Casa  di  Accoglienza  delle  Donne  Maltrattate (CADMI) in Milan and its Work and Freedom program. The aim of the program  is  to  facilitate  the  reintegration  and professional development of women who have suffered from violence,  in  order  to  contribute  to  their  socio-economic empowerment.  As  of  October  2022,  122  women  had  joined the program, of whom 35 have already found work.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Foundation is helping the London lack Women's Project (LBWP) to set up The Safe Haven Project. The  aim  is  to  support  150  women  survivors  and  train 200  professionals  in  caring  for  victims  of  gender-based violence by 2024.\n\nThe Kering Foundation also supports grassroots organizations, working  with  Women's  Funds.  In  2022,  it  continued  its  five partnerships  with  Rosa  Fund  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the Mediterranean  Women's  Fund  in  France  and  Italy,  Fondo Semillas  in  Mexico,  the  Women's  Foundation  of  California  in the United States and the HER Fund in Hong Kong.\n\n## Las Panas , Mexico\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2019\n- \u00b7 Providing low-income women with the opportunity to meet for bread-making workshops and support to escape violence\n- \u00b7 Since 2019, 105 women living in Mexico City have taken part in a free three-month workshop. The grant provided by the Foundation in 2021 supported the opening of a social bakery in 2022\n\n## du Pain & des Roses (DPDR), France\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018\n- \u00b7 Training vulnerable women in the practice of floristry through professional courses in order to develop their skills and create social connections\n- \u00b7 Between 2020 and 2022, DPDR significantly increased its professional training offering and obtained accreditation in order to access public funding. With an additional grant from the Kering Foundation, it opened a branch in Nantes, where it organized 14 workshops attended by 107 women in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Via the Women's Foundation of California, the Foundation supports FreeFrom, a non-profit based in Los Angeles that focuses on the financial security and long-term protection of victims of domestic violence. In the United States, 92.3% of  domestic  violence  survivors  stated  that  they  were  also victims of financial abuse, which is a major barrier to them leaving their partners.\n- \u00b7 Since 2016, HER Fund in Hong Kong has been bolstering the financial  resources  and  capacity  of  three  small  grassroots non-profits led by marginalized women who have suffered violence:  two  of  these  organizations  work  to  prevent  and raise awareness of cyberbullying among young people, and the third, Les Corner ,  works with lesbian women who have suffered  domestic  violence.  Over  the  past  five  years,  this organization, founded by eight young Hong Kong volunteers,  has  been  running  awareness-raising  courses, and  has  been  able  to  establish  a  dialogue  with  local authorities  and  the  police  on  procedures  in  tackling matters that affect this community in particular.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  event  took  place  on September 15 th in New York with the support of Kering Group Houses. It raised over USD 3 million and benefited four nonprofits: the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), the Global Fund for Women , the Jordan River Foundation (JRF) and the Ms. Foundation for Women . The money raised will notably fund a legal hotline for victims of violence in the United States, initiatives related to the crisis in Ukraine, and the Girls of Color Initiative , which helps young girls of color experiencing various forms of discrimination\n\n## 6.3.1.2 Changing behaviors and mentalities by engaging with young people to promote gender equality\n\nAs  well  as  providing  support  for  victims,  it  is  essential  to address  the  origins  of  violence  with  a  view  to  preventing  it occurring  in  the  first  place.  In  2022,  the  Kering  Foundation stepped  up  its  support  for  young  people,  and  boys  in particular, in order to break the cycle of violence.\n\n- \u00b7 In  New  York,  the  Foundation  pursued  its  commitment  to the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault (NYCAASA) and  its  Project  Dream  Own  Tell  (DOT),  an  innovative program  that  prevents  sexual  violence  and  works  with young  people  from  underprivileged  communities.  Project DOT  offers  these  young  people,  who  are  often  excluded from  traditional  sex  education  programs,  a  platform  for creating and sharing positive messages with their communities. In 2022, 52 young people benefited from the project  and  more  than  175  people  took  part  in  events  to raise  awareness  of  violence.  The  organization  also  started translating its resources into Spanish in order to reach its target communities more effectively.\n- \u00b7 The Kering Foundation renewed its support to Equimundo, formerly  known  as Promundo-US , an  organization  that promotes  gender  equality,  particularly  among  men  and boys.  Together,  they  continued  to  deploy  the Global Boyhood Initiative (GBI) to provide boys aged 4-13 (and the adults  around  them)  with  educational  tools  to  help  them grow  into  men  embracing  a  healthy  and  gender-sensitive masculinity.  The  initiative  focuses  on  four  fundamental axes:  sharing  emotions  in  healthy  ways,  accepting  and connecting with others, breaking free from stereotypes, and standing  up  and  speaking  out  against  bullying  and inequality.  After  being  launched  in  the  United  States  in 2020  and  after  quantitative  and  qualitative  research  in 2021, GBI was launched in the United Kingdom in 2022. The State  of  UK  Boys  2022  was  published  in  November, highlighting the pressure on boys to conform to masculine norms.  At  the  same  time,  Lifting  Limits,  a  UK  non-profit developed a pilot program in schools for children aged 711. In France, the initiative should launch in 2023 with the name 'D'\u00e9gal \u00e0 \u00e9gale' ,  supported by studies carried out by Ipsos and ARESVI .  As  part  of  this  initiative,  non-profit En avant  toute(s) has  started  to  hold  equality  workshops  in three  schools,  in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  almost 450 young people.\n- \u00b7 Gendes is  a  non-profit  in  Mexico  that  runs  weekly  men's group sessions to encourage a shift in mindsets with regard to the definition of masculinity. Since it was founded, it has helped  1,050  men  to  explore  how  every  person  is responsible  for  their  actions.  Three  out  of  four  women whose partners have taken part in Gendes' programs have reported a reduction in violence and feel increasingly safe in their relationships.\n\nIn 2022, the Kering Foundation stepped up its commitment to breaking  the  intergenerational  cycle  of  violence  and  the silence that surrounds the subject of incest. According to the World  Health  Organization,  20%  of  women  and  between  5% and  10%  of  men  say  that  they  suffered  sexual  abuse  during childhood.  80%  were  victims  of  incest.  In  response  to  this intolerable  reality,  in  2019,  the  Foundation  supported La Maison des femmes de Saint Denis to create a new unit focused on  treating  adults  who  were  abused  during  their  childhood. In  2022,  47  women  survivors  of  incest  received  support  and 69  consultations  took  place.  In  parallel,  212  healthcare professionals received training in how to provide better care to victims and 105 in-school interventions took place in France.\n\n- \u00b7 The Foundation is also a partner of the Grande Cause pour la  Protection  de  l'Enfance ,  together  with Make.org and  the French  Secretary  of  State  for  Children  and  Families,  with the aim of taking action alongside specialist organizations and protecting young people. In 2022, several projects were developed,  including  an  e-learning  course  for  healthcare professionals, support groups for victims of bullying and a chatbot for young people aged 10-14, deployed by En avant toute(s) to  facilitate  discussions on the theme of romantic and family relationships.\n- \u00b7 The Foundation continued to support the non-profit Face \u00e0 l'Inceste , in order to raise its profile and communicate more effectively.\n\n## 6.3.1.3 Working together for a greater impact\n\nThrough the efforts of its networks and collective action, the Kering Foundation works to achieve a lasting shift in behavior patterns and greater awareness of violence against women.\n\nAccordingly,  in  2011  it  developed  an  in-house  program  to create a safe and supportive working environment for victims of violence. The Kering Foundation trains employees from the Group  and  its  Houses  on  understanding,  listening  to  and helping  victims  of  domestic  violence,  in  partnership  with expert  organizations:  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Nationale  Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF,  France), Donne  in  Rete  Contro  la  Violenza (D.i.Re, Italy), Women's Aid (United Kingdom) and the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV,  United  States).  So far, 1,912 employees have received this training, including all members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  The  Foundation  has also  developed  a  30-minute  e-learning  session,  available  in seven  languages  (English,  French,  Italian,  Spanish,  German, Portuguese and Dutch) for all employees.\n\nThe  Global  Policy  on  Domestic  Violence,  launched  by  the Kering  Foundation  in  coordination  with  the  Group's  Human Resources  Department  in  2021,  guarantees  confidential  and appropriate support to any person employed by Kering or its brands.  Support  measures  include  flexible  working  hours, special  leave  and  financial  help,  and  victims  are  also  put  in touch  with  specialist  organizations.  The  Policy  has  been translated  into  nine  languages,  and  can  be  consulted  at  any time by the Group's employees.",

        "page_content": "Externally, the Foundation seeks to mobilize others to join its efforts.  In  2018,  the  Kering  Foundation  and FACE Foundation co-founded One In Three Women ,  the  first  European  network of  companies  committed  to  combating  violence  against women.  The  network  currently  has  15  members  alongside FACE and the Kering Foundation: L'Or\u00e9al, Korian, BNP Paribas, Carrefour, le Fonds de solidarit\u00e9 OuiCare, SNCF, Publicis, PwC, Epnak,  Orange,  Superga  Beauty,  Air  France,  Sanofi,  La  Poste and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD).\n\nTo mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against  Women  on  November  25,  2022,  the  network  held  a campaign on LinkedIn to encourage other companies to take action: entitled Sous Vos Yeux (Before Your Eyes) , its aim was to highlight  the  weak  signals  when  a  woman  is  suffering domestic violence.\n\nThe  Foundation  also  communicated  on  the  new Maison  des Femmes  de  Rennes , and  provided  financial  support  and additional  coverage  for  the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Nationale  Solidarit\u00e9 Femmes (FNSF)'s  campaign  to  raise  awareness  of  economic abuse.\n\nAs  a  Leader  of  the  Generation  Equality  Forum's  Action Coalition on Gender-based Violence and as part of the 16 Days of  Activism ,  the  Foundation  co-organized  with UN  Women a working group in December 2022. The event was attended by 15  companies  in  Paris,  including  BNP  Paribas,  Paypal, Vodafone  and  Accor.  Its  aim  was  to  allow  private-sector entities to share best practice about how action can be taken in the workplace to combat domestic violence.\n\n## Focus on: the Giving Back platform\n\nThe  Kering  Foundation  encourages  Group  employees  to  use  their  professional  and  personal  skills  to  support  partner organizations  and  social  enterprises.  Since  2021,  volunteering  opportunities  have  been  available  on  the  Giving  Back platform, managed by Kering's HR department. Employees in France, Italy and the United Kingdom can dedicate 21 hours of working  time  per  year  to  local  non-profit  organizations,  depending  on  their  needs  and  skills.  In  2022,  seven  of  the Foundation's partner organizations offered missions.\n\n## 6.3.2 The Group's philanthropic activity\n\nAlongside the initiatives undertaken by the Kering Foundation, Kering and each House support causes of their own choice by providing  financial  support,  donating  products,  running special sales, taking part in charity dinners, offering employee skills  and  time,  or  forming  partnerships  with  non-profit organizations. In 2022, support for various causes connected with the Group's corporate citizenship approach - such as the protection of women against violence, inclusion and the fight against  discrimination,  the  preservation  of  cultural,  artistic and historical heritage and environmental protection, in which the House's initiatives are detailed below - totaled more than \u20ac14,680,000. This also includes a number of other initiatives focusing on education, efforts to fight poverty, the promotion of  health  and  sport,  as  well  as  the  refugee  crisis  in  Ukraine. Several  of  them  are  specifically  for  the  benefit  of  women, consistent with the Group's priorities, and children, and of the aforementioned  total  support  figure  of  \u20ac14,680,000,  these initiatives accounted for more than \u20ac5,792,000.\n\nThese commitments form part of the Group's efforts in pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## 6.3.2.1 Support for women and children\n\nIn  2022,  Kering  and its  Houses backed several programs and organizations  working  to  support  for  women  and  children, providing overall funding of around \u20ac5,792,000.\n\n- \u00b7 They  also  came  together  to  support  the Caring  for Women fundraising dinner organized  by  the  Kering Foundation  in  2022.

It supports  employees  of  workshops  in  Penne,  Civitella, Montebello and Curno, with a specific attention on women. It aims to provide them with the tools they need to manage and  defuse  conflicts  and  stressful  situations.  Brioni  also renewed its collaboration with Colori  Vivi  Sartoria, a  social enterprise supported by the Kering Foundation and Gucci, which  provides  training  to  refugee  women  in  the  field  of tailoring, to help them become financially independent and gain self-confidence.\n- \u00b7 Pomellato continued its partnership with non-profit Casa di Accoglienza  delle  Donne  Maltrattate  di  Milano (CADMI)  by holding a charity event entitled Women, Audacity, Freedom.

The House also supported Equality Now , which accompanies  female  activists  in  the  Middle  East,  North Africa  and  South  Asia,  along  with  non-profit Mothers  to Mothers ,  which provides healthcare services to women and children  in  Ghana.  This  initiative,  to  which  Gucci  donated more than \u20ac173,000 in 2022, seeks to provide HIV-positive women with tools to end mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  In  parallel,  Gucci  also  supported  the Associazione Artemisia in  Florence  and  its SOStieni  la  Libert\u00e0 project, along with SVS Donna Aiuta Donna Onlus in  Milan  and  the Casa Internazionale delle Donne in Rome.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Executive Management,\n\nPursuant  to  your  request  and  in  our  capacity  as  Statutory  Auditor  of  Kering  SA  (hereinafter  the  'Company'),  we  performed  a review with the aim of providing limited assurance on information concerning the Environmental Profit & Loss Account ('EP&L') selected by the Company (hereinafter 'the Information (1) ') for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased  on  the  procedures  we  have  performed  as  described  under  the  paragraph  'Nature  and  scope  of  procedures',  and  the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the procedures used by the Company (hereinafter the 'Guidelines').\n\n## Preparation of the Information\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used reference framework or established practices on on which to base the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Information  must  be  read  and  interpreted  with  reference  to  the  Guidelines  and  criteria,  summarised  in  the methodological note referred in section 5.1.1.1 of the Universal Reference Document and available on the Company's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used, including certain elements such as traceability and certifications, environmental impact factors ('multipliers') and monetisation factors used. Some data are sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions and/or estimates used  for  its  preparation  and  presented  in  the  methodological  note  referred  in  section  5.1.1.1  of  the  Universal  Reference Document.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nThe Company is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Selecting or establishing suitable criteria and procedures for preparing the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 Preparing the Information in accordance with the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 Implementing  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  of  the  Information  that  is  free  from  material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor\n\nThe conclusion presented in this assurance report only covers the Information and does not extend to other information and data concerning the Environmental Profit & Loss account (EP&L) included in the Universal Reference Document.\n\n- (1) Total amount for environmental impact estimated in \u20ac for 2022, Intensity (\u20acEP&L/\u20ac thousand of revenue) for 2022, % change in total amount and intensity in relation to 2021, Mapping of 2022 impacts per environmental impact (six impacts for Tiers 0 to 4 and for the use and end of life phases), Distribution of impacts per raw material (Tiers 3 & 4) for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  also  takes  account  of the  requirements  set  out  in  Article  173  of  French  law no.  2015-992  of  August  17,  2015  on  energy  transition  for sustainable development.\n\nThe AMF's framework is based not only on the aforementioned French  and  EU  legislation  and  regulations,  but  also  on internal  control  and  risk  management  best  practices  and international  standards,  in  particular  ISO  31000  and  COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations), which were analyzed  in  depth  when  the  risk  management  policy  was drafted.  This  policy  is  set  out  in  the  section  entitled 'Components of risk management'.\n\nIn accordance  with  ordinance  order  no.  2017-1180  of July 19, 2017 on non-financial reporting and its implementing decree  no.  2017-1265  of  August  9,  2017,  the  Kering  group presents  the  Non-Financial  Information  Statement  (NFIS) for 2022 in Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document. The following sections include references to the NFIS.\n\n## 1.1 Scope and principles of organization\n\nKering  is  the  parent  company  of  the  Kering  group,  whose entities  operate  in  the  luxury  industry.  The  following  report aims to describe the internal control procedures in the Group and  especially  those  procedures  relating  to  the  preparation and  processing  of  financial  and  accounting  information. The scope of the Group covered by the report includes all fully consolidated  subsidiaries,  i.e.  the  companies  over  which  the Group directly or indirectly exercises exclusive control.\n\nAs  a  holding  company,  Kering's  own  operations  consist  in (i) defining  and  implementing  its  strategy,  (ii)  organizing and managing its holdings, (iii)  stimulating  the  development of its activities and coordinating their financing, (iv) providing support  and  communication  functions,  and  (v)  defining  and implementing the insurance coverage policy.\n\nThe internal control function follows the general organization of the Group. It is both:\n\n- \u00b7 decentralized  at  the  level  of  the  activities:  Executive Management of the operating and legal entities is responsible for managing and coordinating the internal control process;\n- \u00b7 unified around a common methodology and a single set of standards.  The  Kering  holding  company  coordinates  its deployment across the Group, supported by teams at Kering Asia-Pacific and Kering Americas.\n\n## 1.2 General principles of risk management\n\nAccording to the AMF definition, risks represent the possibility that an event may occur and could have an impact on people, assets,  the  environment,  the  Company's  objectives  and  its reputation.\n\nRisk management covers areas that are much wider than just financial risks: for example, operational, labor-related, environmental and compliance risk. Risk management is a key management tool that helps to:\n\n- \u00b7 create and preserve the value, assets and reputation of the Company;\n\n- \u00b7 strengthen the security of the Company's decision-making and  other  processes  to  support  the  achievement  of  its objectives;\n- \u00b7 mitigate  the  risk  of  unexpected  outcomes  and  operating losses;\n- \u00b7 ensure  that  initiatives  are  consistent  with  the  Company's values;\n- \u00b7 bring  Company  employees  together  to  develop  a  shared view of the main risks.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Components of risk management\n\nThe  Group  constantly  strives  to  make  its  operations  more secure and improve its methodology to identify and mitigate risks. In 2022, the Group moved ahead with the changes to its risk management methodology initiated in 2011 and  maintained  the  resources  used  for  its  risk  management process.  The  Group's  process  provides  for  an  organizational framework,  a  three-step  risk  management  process  and continuous monitoring.\n\n## 1.3.1 Organizational framework\n\nThis organizational framework includes:\n\n- \u00b7 an organization that sets out the roles and responsibilities of the various persons involved and lays down procedures, as well as consistent and clear standards, for the process;\n- \u00b7 a risk management policy that sets out the objectives of the process  in  line  with  the  Company's  culture,  the  shared language  used,  and  the  process  to  identify,  analyze  and deal with risks;\n- \u00b7 an IT system that makes it possible to register data about risks;\n- \u00b7 planned reporting of risk information to stakeholders identified within the Group, as well as an annual presentation to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nWithin the scope of the Group's risk management policy and in accordance  with  Kering's  corporate  governance,  Kering's Executive Management  created a 'Kering Group Risk Committee'  in  2011.  It  comprises  of  the  Group  Managing Director,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  the  General  Counsel, the Chief Audit Executive, the Head  of  the  Security Department,  the  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  and  the Risk Manager. As the Group's operations and activities expand, become  more  complex  and  more  international,  the  Risk Committee helps identify and rank the main risks that could have an impact on the Group's business operations. Internal rules  determine how the Committee is managed, and how it operates.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews (i) the validation and monitoring process  for  the  Group's  risk  management  policy;  (ii)  the monitoring  of  the  latest  developments  and  relevance  of analysis relating to operational, labor-related, environmental, financial  and  compliance  risks;  (iii)  the  analysis  summaries of  general  and  specific  risks;  and  (iv)  the  validation  and monitoring  of  action  plans  rolled  out  with  the  aim  of mitigating identified risks.\n\nThe Risk Committee's work is brought to the attention of the Audit  Committee,  which  is  informed  of  the  Committee's internal rules and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\n## Risk Manager\n\nThe  Risk  Manager  position  was  created  within  the  Company to  coordinate  the  robust  risk  management  process,  ensure that the Executive Management teams of the Group's activities analyze  the  main  risks  within  their  scope  of  business,  and provide  the  members  of  the  Risk  Committee,  prior  to  each meeting,  with  the  information  and  documents  necessary  for their work and their discussions.\n\n## Risk management policy\n\nAfter  reviewing  the  COSO  internal  control  frameworks  in particular, the Group implemented a risk management policy that  was  sent  to  the  Executive  Management  teams  of  the group and the Houses. This document describes the methods used by the Group for its risk analysis.\n\n## 1.3.2 A three-step risk management process involving:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying risks : in this step, the main risks are identified. A risk is characterized by an event, one or more internal or external  sources,  and  one  or  more  consequences.  Within the Group, the identification of risks is part of an ongoing process that takes the Houses' perspective into account, as well  as  the  Group's  broader  vision.  During  this  stage, interviews  with  the  main  stakeholders  (the  recommended and most widely used technique) are conducted to identify the risks that could impact the Group's ability to achieve its objectives. Kering relies on prior year's risk registers, as well as various sources that are, both external (e.g. surveys) and internal (e.g. reporting of information).\n- \u00b7 Assessing risks : this step involves evaluating the main risks identified on the basis of three criteria: their impact, their probability of occurrence and their level of control. It is also a  continuous effort,  and  assessments are conducted once a  year  during  work  sessions  with  key  managers  from  the Houses, Kering's divisions in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the Group. The risk management policy describes in detail the criteria and procedures for these assessments.\n- \u00b7 Prioritizing risks :  during this last step, risks are ranked by priority  and  the  most  appropriate  action  plan(s)  for  the Company is(are) identified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective is to identify and analyze the main risks and to learn from the risks that have materialized.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  meets  in  principle  at  least  twice  a  year to  review  the  risk  maps  drawn  up  by  the  Group  Internal Audit Department, and to monitor the progress of the specific action plans.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  met  four  times  in  2022,  and  the  Audit Committee and Board of Directors were apprised of its work at their meetings held in June and October 2022, respectively.\n\n## 1.4 Link between risk management and internal control\n\nThe  risk  management  and  internal  control  processes  are complementary,  which  together  help  control  the  Group's activities:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  management  process  is  designed  to  identify  and analyze the main risks. Risks are managed and addressed through action plans, which may include project management and may also involve implementing controls that can be adapted to the organization. The controls to be implemented are part of the internal control program and may be reviewed based on the risk maps;\n\n- \u00b7 the  internal  control  program  uses  the  risk  management process to identify the main risks to be mitigated;\n- \u00b7 the  audit  plan  uses  the  risk  map  to  test  the  assessment of the level of control of the identified risks.\n\nThe  interaction  and  the  combined  balance  between  the  two processes  are  influenced  by  the  control  environment,  which provides  a  common  foundation  particularly  the  risk  and control culture of the Company and the ethical values of the Group.",

As well as analyzing feedback, it defines action plans based on internal control self-assessment campaigns and on recommendations made in internal audit reports.\n\n## 1.5 General principles of internal control\n\n## 1.5.1 Definition of internal control\n\nThe  internal  control  procedures  applicable  within  the  Kering group rely on a set of resources, policies, conduct, procedures and  appropriate  actions  to  ensure  that  the  necessary measures are taken in order to control:\n\n- \u00b7 activities, operational effectiveness and the efficient use of resources;\n- \u00b7 operational, labor-related, environmental,  financial or compliance  risks  that  could  have  a  significant  impact  on the Company's assets or the achievement of its objectives.\n\nInternal  control  is  defined  as  a  process  conducted  by Executive  Management,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Board of  Directors,  and  implemented  by  senior  executives  and  all employees.  Regardless  of  its  quality  and  its  degree  of application,  it  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  that  the objectives falling within the following categories will be met:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations in force;\n- \u00b7 application  of  guidelines  and  directions  set  by  Executive Management;\n- \u00b7 smooth operation of internal processes, particularly those contributing to the safeguarding of assets;\n- \u00b7 reliability of financial and accounting information.\n\n## 1.5.2 Limitations of internal control\n\nThe probability of meeting these objectives is subject to the limitations inherent in any internal control process such as:\n\n- \u00b7 human  errors  or  malfunctions  occurring  when  decisions are made or applied;\n- \u00b7 deliberate  collusion  among  multiple  individuals,  enabling them to elude the control system;\n- \u00b7 situations in which implementing or maintaining a control would be more expensive than the risk that it is intended to remedy.\n\nFurthermore, in pursuing the objectives indicated above, it is understood  that  companies  are  faced  with  events  and uncertainties beyond their control (unexpected changes in the markets,  competitive  environment  or  geopolitical  situation, or error in forecasting or assessing the effects of such changes on the organization, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  includes  principles  and  values governing  the  conduct  and  ethics  of  all  its  employees, presented  in  the  Code  of  Ethics.  It  also  includes  an  Internal Control  Charter.  Moreover,  it  relies  on  human  resources management  that  ensures  the  competency,  ethical  conduct and involvement of its employees.\n\n## The Group Charter\n\nThe Kering group adopted a Charter several years ago, which was  updated  in  2012  and  provides  the  framework  for  the decentralization  of  the  organization  and  the  responsibility of senior executives. The Charter defines the guiding principles governing  the  relations  between  Kering  and  its  activities. It also defines, within each functional area: (i) the matters that fall within  the  delegated  responsibility  of  the  activities; (ii) those  that  must  be  communicated  to  Kering  within appropriate time frames; and (iii) those requiring Kering's prior authorization.\n\n## Group principles and values\n\nThe  ethical  principles  of  the  Kering  group  are  set  out  in  the Code of Ethics, first circulated in 2005 and then again in 2009, 2013  and  2019,  following  its  update  in  2018.  It  is  now available to all Group employees in 14 languages.\n\nThe latest update focused chiefly on strengthening commitments regarding personnel and the behavior expected of everyone, including Group measures and policies that were implemented  following  the  introduction  of  new  legislation and regulations, such as France's Sapin II law. The update was also  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  Suppliers'  Charter included in the Code of Ethics, with regard to human rights in particular. In addition, the Code of Ethics now extends to the commitments of members of the Executive Committee as well as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and for the first time,  was  presented  to  and  reviewed  by  the  Kering  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe Code of Ethics clearly sets out the ethical principles that should be applied everywhere and by everyone, including the Group's  values,  what  it  believes  in,  and  what  it  does  not tolerate.  It  presents  the  Group's  ethics  organization  (regional Ethics  Committees,  the  Group  Ethics  Committee,  the  ethics hotline  and  the  steps  to  take  in  cases  of  suspected\n\nnon-compliance  with  Kering's  ethics  commitments)  and contains  the  Group's  commitments  and  rules  of  conduct towards its main stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 employees;\n- \u00b7 customers and consumers;\n- \u00b7 shareholders and financial markets;\n- \u00b7 business partners and competitors;\n- \u00b7 the environment;\n- \u00b7 civil society.\n\nAs part of its revitalized commitment to the promotion of and respect for ethics within the Group, an annual online training program in ethics and Code of Conduct compliance was rolled out for all Kering employees worldwide in 2014. It is based on case studies that show ethics in the light of daily professional life and is updated annually.\n\nThe  Ethics  Committees  are  composed  of  representatives  of the  Group's  Houses  and  Kering  staff.  This  entire  structure  is managed  by  Kering's  Chief  Sustainability  and  Institutional Affairs Officer.\n\nThe Ethics Committees have three main functions:\n\n- \u00b7 supervising  the  circulation  and  application  of  the  Code  of Ethics and the principles that it establishes;\n- \u00b7 responding to any issues raised by a Group employee, be it a  simple  request  for  clarification  or  a  question  relating to  the  interpretation  of  the  Code  and  its  application, or a complaint submitted to the Committee due to alleged non-compliance with one of the Group's ethical principles, a procedure  now  open  to  third  parties  in  certain circumstances;\n- \u00b7 generating initiatives for developing the Group's sustainability and ethics policy and activities.\n\nThe changes made to the Code and the organization of ethics within the Group are examined in detail in section 2 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Document.\n\n## The Internal Control Charter\n\nThe Kering group adopted an Internal Control Charter in 2010. In  order  to  adapt  the  Charter  to  changes  within  the  Group since  its  initial  publication,  a  new  edition  was  published  in 2015.  The  Charter  defines  internal  control  and  sets  out  its objectives  as  presented  in  the  AMF's  reference  framework. It  also  specifies  the  limitations  of  internal  control,  which cannot  under  any  circumstances  provide  absolute  assurance that  the  Company's  objectives  will  be  achieved.  The  Charter specifies that the holding company acts as the fulcrum point coordinating  the  various  entities.  It  also  sets  out  the responsibilities  of  each  of  the  activities  and  Houses  in implementing  an  internal  control  process  that  fits  their operations.\n\nThe  Charter  defines  the  role  of  each  person  involved  in  the internal  control  process  and  the  bodies  responsible  for oversight and assessment.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Charter  specifies  the  existing  tools  for assessing  internal  control  and  risks,  namely  self-assessment of  internal  control,  mapping  of  major  risks  and  sets  out  the basic principles for creating new procedures.",

The  Executive  Management  teams'  involvement  is of  key  importance  to  the  internal  control  process  given  the Kering group's organization.\n\nManagement  plays  a  leading  operational  role  in  internal control;  it  relies  on  internal  control  to  perform  its  duties and  reach  its  objectives.  In  this  respect,  management implements the internal control operations related to its area of responsibility and ensures that the internal control process fits its activities.\n\nEmployees  must  have  the  knowledge  and  information necessary to set up, operate and oversee the internal control process  in  order  to  meet  the  objectives  assigned  to  them. In their day-to-day activities, they follow the principles, rules of  control  and  can  suggest  ways  to  improve  and  detect malfunctions.\n\nThe bodies responsible for oversight and assessment are:\n\n## The Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  contributes  to  the  overall  control environment  through  its  members'  skills  and  expertise. The  Board  is  regularly  informed  about  the  methodologies used for internal control and the management of major risks, which it presents in its Board report.\n\nThe duties of the Board of Directors are presented in section 2.2.1 of Chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nUnder the responsibility of the Board of Directors, to which it regularly reports on these matters, the Kering Audit Committee  is  comprised  of  six  members,  four  of  whom  are independent. It is in charge of monitoring:\n\n- \u00b7 the procedures for preparing financial information;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems;\n- \u00b7 the  statutory  audits  of  annual  financial  statements  and, if  need  be,  consolidated  financial  statements  performed by the Statutory Auditors;\n- \u00b7 the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Kering Audit Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 verifies  that  the  Group  has  an  Internal  Audit  Department that is structured and well suited to the tasks of identifying, detecting  and  preventing  risks,  anomalies  or  irregularities in the management of the Group's affairs;\n- \u00b7 assesses  the  relevance  and  quality  of  the  methods  and procedures used;\n- \u00b7 reviews the Internal Audit reports and the recommendations issued;\n- \u00b7 approves the annual Internal Audit plan;\n- \u00b7 reviews  the  work  conducted  by  the  Risk  Committee  and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\nSince  2021,  Kering's  Audit  Committee  has  met  at  least  five times a year.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  its  duties  are presented in section 2.3.3 of Chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Internal Audit and Risk Management Department\n\nKering group's Internal Audit Department ensures full coverage of the Group.\n\nThrough its work, the Internal Audit Department helps assess the internal control process and recommends improvements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Chief  Audit Executive  informs  Executive  Management  and  reports  the main results of his assessments to the Audit Committee.\n\nIt  coordinates,  harmonizes  and  optimizes  working  methods and tools, as well as providing services (regulatory intelligence, expertise,  resources,  etc.)  and  conducting  audit  assignments within the scope of the annual audit plan.\n\nThe  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  centrally  administers and  analyzes  internal  control  and  risk  management  in accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  applicable  in  this area, as described above.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department also performs active intelligence  monitoring  with  regard  to  best  internal  control practices.  It  checks  the  control  procedures  implemented  by other  departments  and  conducts  operational  and  financial audits  within  its  remit.  In  light  of  the  pandemic  situation, the Internal Audit Department conducted 38 audit assignments at Group entities and 146 audit assignments in stores during 2022.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department draws up the audit plan based, on  the  Group's  process  guidelines  and  from  the  major  risks identified for the Houses. It takes account of special requests from senior management and other operational departments. These projects are discussed with the main persons in charge. The  Audit  Committee  reviews  and  approves  the  final  audit plan.\n\nThe  main  issues  identified  by  the  Internal  Audit  Department are  reported  to  the  Audit  Committee.  In  this  way,  the  Audit Committee is informed of the issues identified and the action plans set up by the entities concerned.\n\nApart  from  these  assignments,  all  of  the  Internal  Audit resources  in  the  Kering  group  are  dedicated  to  promoting internal  control  across  all  business  processes  and  activities, be they operational or financial, related to stores, warehouses or headquarters, distribution or manufacturing activities.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Group's Internal Audit Department had 21  employees,  a  number  that  had  remained  virtually  stable since 2017. Their rules of conduct are described in their Audit Charter, to which they refer. A new version of the Audit Charter was published in 2018. The Charter stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 at the end of each audit, the findings and recommendations are  presented  to  the  managers  of  the  area  or  areas concerned;\n- \u00b7 any  agreements  or  disagreements  made  known  by  the audited parties concerning the proposed recommendations are  included  in  the  final  report,  which  specifies  any action  plan,  as  well  as  responsibilities  and  the  deadlines for implementation;\n- \u00b7 the  operational  staff  members  concerned  are  responsible for implementing recommendations;\n- \u00b7 the Internal Audit Department is in charge of verifying their implementation.\n\nInternal Audit activities are performed in conjunction with the work  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  results  of  the  work performed by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department updates the Audit Committee on progress made on the audit plan and the follow-up of the action plans at least once a year.\n\nIn  2013,  Kering's  Internal  Audit  Department  published  the following  referential  frameworks  that  establish  a  common methodology:  the  audit  manual  and  the  audit  approach. In 2020, the approach to auditing stores was updated.\n\nIn December  2021,  Kering's  Internal  Audit  Department obtained  professional  certification  from  the  IFACI  (French institute  of  audit  and  internal  control)  that  it  conducts  its activities  in  accordance  with  the  mandatory  requirements of  the  International  Professional  Practices  Framework  of the  Institute  of  Internal  Auditors  (IIA).  This  seal  of  quality demonstrates that the Internal Audit Department adds value for  the  Group,  improves  its  operations  and  helps  it  to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach  to  evaluate  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  risk management, control, and governance processes.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Kering  Internal  Audit  Department  introduced a  tool  for  drafting  and  sharing  reports  on  audit  assignments in  stores.  The  follow-up  process  on  the  various  assignment stages is fully digitalized, making  for more  effective monitoring and smoother discussions with stakeholders.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Statutory Auditors review the internal controls in order to certify the financial statements. They do so by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of internal controls, assessing the risk  of  material  misstatement,  and,  where  applicable,  making recommendations.  Under  no  circumstances  do  the  Statutory Auditors  take  the  place  of  the  Company  in  implementing internal controls.\n\nThe  role of the Statutory Auditors is to certify the completeness,  accuracy  and  fair  presentation  of  the  parent company and consolidated financial statements on an annual basis  and  issue  a  review  report  on  the  Group's  interim consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe audit engagements are split between the joint Statutory Auditors: Deloitte and PwC.\n\nThe  main  matters  covered  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  risk  areas  and  performing  tests  by  sampling in  order  to  validate  the  completeness,  accuracy  and  fair presentation  of  the  financial  statements  with  regard  to their individual or consolidated materiality threshold;\n- \u00b7 validating  the  main  types  of  accounting  treatment  and options  throughout  the  year,  in  coordination  with  the management of the activities and Kering;\n- \u00b7 applying  the  accounting  standards  defined  by  Kering  for its activities based on the relevant accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 preparing an audit report for each House, in order to certify Kering's  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  any comments on internal control;\n- \u00b7 presenting  a  general  overview  of  the  Kering  group  to Kering's Management and to the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 preparing  the  Statutory  Auditors'  reports  for  Kering's shareholders.  These  reports  are  presented  in  Chapter  6 of this Document.",

The  risk  factors  identified  are  subject  to the mitigation measures presented in section 2 of this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6.4 Oversight of the process\n\nThe  ongoing  oversight  of  the  internal  control  process  and regular review of its functioning rely on the work performed by the  Internal  Audit  Department,  any  comments  made  by  the Statutory  Auditors  and  the  annual  self-assessments.  In  the annual  self-assessments  carried  out  within  the  entities  for each process identified, the managers in charge are asked to assess  the  level  of  internal  control  through  key  controls  for their  operations,  in  order  to  identify  any  weaknesses  and implement corrective measures.\n\nSelf-assessment is not simply a reporting tool intended for the Internal Audit Department or the Audit Committee; it is also a system  that  allows  the  Executive  Management  teams  of  the activities to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the strength  of  the  internal  control  process.  Self-assessment makes  it  possible  to  strengthen  the  level  of  internal  control through operational action plans.\n\nThe approach used to analyze internal control is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 a self-assessment, using questionnaires, is conducted with the  key  operational  staff  members  in  each  of  the  entities following the breakdown of operations into key processes. In 2015, all of the questionnaires were reviewed in the light of  participants'  responses  during  the  previous  annual assessment  and  comments  from  those  conducting  the assessments.  Key  controls,  as  well  as  fraud  risk  controls, were also identified and added to these questionnaires in order  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  action  plans. The  self-assessment  campaign  now  covers  all  of  Kering's operations. The overhaul of the self-assessment questionnaires  continued  in  2019  in  order  to  make  them more effective and a better fit for the business operations. In  2021, the financial process questionnaires were revised to reflect the changes introduced within the Group. In 2022, the  entire  content  of  the  questionnaires  for  the  other processes  was  reviewed.  The  goal  of  the  update  was  to focus on more operational, clearer and more concise points reflecting  adjustments  to  the  Group's  processes  that  have undergone major changes;\n- \u00b7 these  questionnaires  provide  operational  staff  with  an additional indicator for assessing the quality of the internal control procedures of which they are in charge. They make it possible  to  harmonize  the  level  of  internal  control applied  throughout  the  Group  and  for  all  activities  to benefit  from  best  practices,  in  particular  newly  acquired entities.  They  allow  action  plans  to  be  launched  based  on the results of these self-assessments;\n- \u00b7 the finance, accounting and management process questionnaire  takes  into  account  the  AMF's  reference framework  and,  in  particular,  its  application  guide.  It includes some 60 questions on the Group's mandatory key controls.  It  is  circulated  among  the  largest  subsidiaries  in the Group's activities. There was no change in the scope of processes covered in 2022.\n\nSince  2013,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  has  extended  its self-assessment procedures to stores throughout the Group's Houses.  These  self-assessments  give  the  sales  network managers an idea of the effectiveness of their internal control and represent a training  guide  to  help  store  managers  meet their internal control obligations. The self-assessment questionnaire for the Group's stores was extensively revised in the  first  half  of  2020  to  (i)  take  into  account  changes  in  all store activities, (ii) clarify and simplify the questions and make them more relevant, and (iii) simplify the connection with the control  points  verified  during  in-store  audits  for  comparison purposes.  In  addition,  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the  results, the  frequency  of  self-assessment  campaigns  in  stores  was reduced  from  half-yearly  to  yearly.  This  approach  was presented and approved by the Kering Audit Committee.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group's  Finance  Department  continued  to implement the tool for continuously monitoring the transactional  activities  managed  by  the  Group,  within  the financial Shared Services Centers. It was deployed more widely across  financial  processes  in  accordance  with  the  Group's financial transformation project.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  the  level  of  Kering,  this  department supervises the Financial Control Department (which includes the accounting, consolidation and management control teams), the Financial Communications Department, the Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department and the Tax Department.\n\n## 1.7.1 Financial Control Department\n\nThe  financial  information  is  produced  and  analyzed  using a set of financial management procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 medium-term plans, which measure the impact of strategic priorities  on  the  Group's  key  financial  and  management indicators.  They  are  also  used  for  the  annual  assessment by the Group of the useful value of assets allocated to the various cash-generating units;\n- \u00b7 budgets,  which  are  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of  discussions between  the  operating  departments  and  the  members  of the  Group's  Executive  Management.  The  first  phase  takes place  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  fiscal  year  when  a preliminary  budget  sets  out  the  main  financial  indicators and  operating  action  plans.  The  second  stage,  which finalizes the budget, takes place in the first quarter of the following year and builds in any significant events that may have occurred in the meantime;\n- \u00b7 monthly  reporting  that  monitors  the  performance  of  the Group's  activities  throughout  the  fiscal  year  via  specific indicators whose consistency and reliability are reviewed by the  Financial  Control  Department.  This  department  also oversees  the  consistency  of  the  accounting  treatment applied  by  the  activities  with  Group  rules  and  carries  out, together  with  their  financial  controllers,  an  analytical review  by  comparison  with  the  budget  and  the  previous year;\n- \u00b7 monthly  meetings  of  Kering's  Executive  Management  and the  senior  executives  of  the  Group's  activities  to  assess business  trends  on  the  basis  of  financial  and  operational data provided by meeting participants;\n- \u00b7 the Group's regular monitoring of the activities' off-balance sheet  commitments.  This  control  is  carried  out,  in particular,  as  part  of  the  statutory  consolidation  process insofar  as  the  activities  are  required  to  provide  an exhaustive list of their commercial or financial commitments and to monitor them from year to year.\n\nThe  statutory  consolidation  of  the  financial  statements  is carried out at the end of June and December using the Group consolidation  tool.  It  enables  financial  information  to  be transferred from the activities in real time after full validation of  the  consolidation  reporting  packages  by  the  Statutory Auditors  and  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  and  Chief Financial Officers of the Houses. They make a legally binding commitment via a signed representation letter, underpinning the quality of the financial information made available.\n\nConsolidation  levels  within  the  activities  provide  a  first  level of control and consistency.\n\nKering's Financial Control Department coordinates the process and  is  in  charge  of  producing  the  Group's  consolidated financial statements. For this purpose, the Department sends instructions to the activities specifying the reports to be sent, the  common  assumptions  to  be  applied  and  the  specific points to be taken into account.\n\n## 1.7.2 Financial Communications Department\n\nThe  Financial  Communications  Department's  role  is  to produce and release the permanent and periodic information that makes up the regulatory information.\n\nIt conducts  this  role  in  line  with  a  precise  regulatory framework and in compliance with the key general principles applicable to financial reporting. The Financial Communications Department thereby upholds the principle of equal  access  to  information  for  investors,  the  principle  of consistent, accurate, precise and fairly presented information and the full and effective release of regulated information.\n\nFinancial Communications forms a key component of market transparency  and  represents  a  core  pillar  of  investor confidence.  It  is  intended  for  a  diverse  range  of  audiences, mainly  consisting  of  institutional  investors,  retail  investors and (financial and non-financial) analysts. Executive Management,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  the  Financial Communications  Department  are  the  contacts  for  analysts and  investors.  The  Human  Resources  Department  provides information  for  employees  and  employee  shareholders,  in conjunction with the Financial Communications Department.\n\nThe  role  of  the  Financial  Communications  Department  also extends  to  non-financial  (CSR)  topics  in  its  dealings  with analysts and investors. Moreover, the Sustainability Department  is  responsible  for  relations  with  non-financial rating agencies.\n\n## 1.7.3 Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department\n\nThe  Financing,  Treasury  and  Insurance  Department  manages liquidity,  counterparty,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate financial risks. It also coordinates the Group's cash management.  It  manages  the  Group's  banking  policy, establishes  guidelines  for  the  allocation  of  activity  by  bank, and coordinates Group calls for tender. It ensures consistency between published financial information and policies governing  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange  and  liquidity  risk management. Almost all of the financing is set up by Kering or Kering Finance. Exceptions are analyzed on a case-by-case basis  according  to  specific  opportunities  or  constraints  and require Kering's agreement.\n\nThe Insurance Department, an integral part of the Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department, establishes and manages  the  Group's  policy  on  insurance.  It  is  responsible for  identifying,  quantifying  and  handling  risks  (prevention, self-insurance or transfer to insurers or reinsurers).",

It  also formulates  Group  policy  and  oversees  its  application.  It provides  the  Houses  with  a  methodology  for  identifying standard  risks  enabling  them  to  anticipate  such  risks  and inform the Legal Department.\n\n## Tax Department\n\nThe  Tax  Department  coordinates  the  Group's  tax  policy  and advises  and  assists  the  activities  on  all  issues  related  to  tax law,  as  well  as  on  the  implementation  of  tax  consolidation in France.\n\n## Communications Department\n\nThe  Communications  Department  is  involved  in  the  Group's development  by  enhancing  its  image  and  reputation  both internally and externally.\n\n## Information Systems Department\n\nThe  Information  Systems  Department  is  responsible  for providing optimal operational performance, controlling IT risk and improving the Group's information systems.\n\n## 2 PRESENTATION OF RISKS\n\nIn accordance with the regulation EU n\u00b02017/1129 of June 14, 2017 (Prospectus Regulation) and ESMA's guidelines on risk factors, the following section describes the main risk factors specific to the Kering group.\n\n## 2.1 Ranking of the Group's main risk factors\n\nThe risks identified by the Group have been ranked according to  their  level  of  criticality,  on  a  scale  ranging  from  1  (very critical) to 4 (less critical), which is based on the probability of their occurrence and the magnitude of their impacts, as well as  reflecting  the  risk  management  measures  implemented.

Furthermore, the Chief Executive Officers of the main Houses sit on Kering's Executive Committee, which gives the  Group  a  better  understanding  of  its  Houses'  needs  and  enables  it  to  maintain  permanent  dialogue  with  the  Creative Directors and support their creative process.\n\nRegular interaction between the Chief Executive Officer and the Creative Director of each House preserves its value and respect for its identity over time. The accounting impacts of impairment losses, which could arise from the loss of a House's appeal, are described in Notes 11, 33.11 and 33.12 to the 2022 consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The team was renamed the Transformation & Data Governance Office in  2022  and  was  additionally  given  responsibility  for  establishing  a  data  governance  framework  within  the  Group  and  its Houses.\n\nThe main goals of the Transformation team are to provide the Group's senior management and the Transformation Initiatives Leads with a holistic view of priorities and projects. The Transformation Office's role is to coordinate and align the Group's stakeholders, identify and anticipate risks, and help to embed and entrench the methodological aspects, where necessary. The alignment of the Group's various projects depends on gaining an overarching view of:\n\n- 1. regularly reviewed business priorities presented in sufficient detail to reflect the constraints and opportunities to make it actionable;\n- 2. all  significant  transformation  projects  in  progress  or  to  be  launched  by  the  Group  or  the  Houses  covering  all  regions and all functional areas, to ensure that the projects are consistent and in line with the Group's strategic vision.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  consolidation  work,  the  Transformation  team  drafted  or  recommended  various  revisions  to  the Transformation Initiatives Leads to make sure they achieve the objectives of the programs in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the risks arising from interdependencies between programs;\n- \u00b7 the  methodological  aspects  with  areas  for  improvement  (e.g.,  change  management  framework,  risk  management framework, post-start-up feedback and tracking of take-up).\n\nThe main objectives of the Data Governance team are to formally establish the Data Governance concepts and principles, disseminate them across Kering's organization (business and IT populations) and at its Houses, and make certain that these concepts are adequately supported by the Technical architecture. Whether these goals will be achieved depends on how the efforts across the various data domains are prioritized. The cross-department drive will need to be incorporated in the Kering Roadmap.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite  this  solid  performance,  the  sector remains exposed to macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.\n\n## In 2022, the main adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was on Chinese demand.\n\nFrom the start of the year, the COVID-19 situation improved considerably in North America and Western Europe, leading to the gradual  lifting  of  most  restrictive  public  health  measures,  despite  further  waves  of  infection  taking  place  during  the  year. As a result, the Group's operations in these two regions were not affected. In Europe, they even received a boost from a sharp upturn in tourist numbers after travel restrictions were lifted.\n\nIn  Japan  and  most  other  countries  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  the  gradual  easing  of  measures  to  control  the  pandemic throughout the first half of 2022 had a major positive impact on consumers' confidence and propensity to spend.\n\nIn China, however, the strict zero-COVID policy was maintained until early December, hampering business levels in the Luxury sector. From the end of the first quarter, China applied Draconian testing and lockdown measures when COVID-19 cases were identified.  This  dragged  down  both  store  footfall,  online  sales,  and  led  to  significant  volatility  in  consumer  spending. After  China  changed its  strategy  for  dealing  with  the  pandemic  at  the  end  of  the  year,  rising  COVID-19  case  numbers  also affected the economic recovery. As a result, in 2022, China was probably the only large market where the Luxury sector's sales fell relative to 2021, although they were much higher than in 2019.\n\nAlso, spending by Chinese consumers mainly took place in China in 2022, as it had in the previous two years. Chinese tourist numbers were particularly low, which continued to affect the performance of the travel retail segment and of certain stores in Europe and Asia relative to 2019. However, starting in the spring, sales to tourists of other nationalities, particularly American, helped offset the loss of opportunity arising from the absence of Chinese tourists.\n\nOverall,  the  pandemic  had  a  very  limited  or  almost  non-existent  impact  on  Luxury  Houses'  main  markets,  with  the  notable exception of China. However, the total impact remains hard to measure, since the deterioration in the various economies' growth outlook has multiple causes that are very indirectly connected to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## To date, the situation in Ukraine and Russia has had a limited, indirect impact on the Group's business.\n\nIn  response  to  the  escalation  in  the  Russia-Ukraine  crisis,  which  became  an  armed  conflict  on  February  23,  2022,  Kering announced on March 4, 2022 that it would close the stores operated by the Group's Houses in Russia. Kering's Houses do not operate any stores in Ukraine.\n\nGiven  the  severity  of  the  situation,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have  lent  their  support  to  humanitarian  efforts  and  to  Ukrainian refugees by making several donations, mainly to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  have  limited  direct  exposure  to  the  crisis.  In  2021,  Kering  generated  around  1%  of  its  total  revenue in Ukraine and Russia, and the net value of its assets in those countries was not material (around 0.1% of the Group total assets).\n\nOperating losses and impairment losses on current assets are recognized under recurring operating income for the year. IFRS 16 lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment were fully written down in the second half of 2022 in a total amount of \u20ac31 million, and the write-down was recognized as a non-recurring operating expense.\n\nThe  Group  adopted  a  number  of  measures  to  make  sure  its  operations  involving  Russia  are  in  compliance  with  the international sanctions. More specifically, the Group took steps to prevent the supply of sanctioned luxury goods to or for use in  Russia.  The Group also reorganized its diamond supply chain and has ceased sourcing them either directly or indirectly from Russia. It should be noted, however, that its diamond purchases from Russia were not material.\n\nMore  indirectly,  the  international  sanctions  adopted  since  war  broke  out  in  Ukraine  also  target  certain  activities  outside Russia, giving rise to greater financial, legal and reputational risk for Kering and its Houses. That said, Kering believes it has taken  the  requisite  measures  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  likelihood  of  risks  occurring  and  mitigate  their  impact. For  more  details  about  the  controls  implemented  by  Kering  concerning  international  sanctions,  please  refer  to  the  Ethics section of chapter 4.",

        "page_content": "The ongoing conflict has obviously had a negative impact on the global economic outlook. Depending on its duration and extent, the conflict could affect the economic growth of the main areas and therefore the Luxury market over a longer period. Since that impact is indirect, however, it does not appear possible to quantify it precisely.\n\n## The Group's approach to risk management\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect, yet unprecedented example of a major crisis significantly affecting the global economy and having a material impact on the Group's revenue growth and profitability, as its 2020 results illustrated. Events of this magnitude, whether they relate to a political crisis or instability, an industrial or natural disaster, or a public health issue, are  rare  and  affect  to  different  extents  the  regions  in  which  the  Group  operates.  Their  impact  over  time  may  also  vary. As regards the COVID-19-related crisis, consolidated revenue in 2021 topped its 2019 level.\n\nPast years have shown that, apart from major systemic or health crises, macro-economic and geopolitical instability can partly explain trends by region, but without significantly affecting the Group's overall performance.\n\nThe diversity of the brands' geographic footprints helps limit the Group's exposure to uncertainties or even to deterioration in a given country's economic or security environment. The Group's distribution network remains balanced across the regions: sales  are  made  through  a  network  of  1,659  directly  operated  stores,  spread  evenly  across  the  main  regions.  Direct  sales (almost 80% of revenue) are supplemented by sales to third party distributors, and the Group's broad spectrum of products makes it less dependent on any single category.\n\nBoth the Group's market positioning and strategy (see section 5 'Our strategy' of Chapter 1 'Presentation of the Group and Integrated Report' for more details) help limit the impacts of macro-economic cycles and uncertainty on its activities.\n\nAs  explained  in  the  overview  of  the  personal  luxury  goods  market  and  the  eyewear  market  (see  section  6  'Our  markets' of Chapter 1 'Presentation of the Group and Integrated Report'), besides cyclical factors or the COVID-19 crisis, which could end  in  the  short  or  medium  term,  the  Group  is  also  exposed  to  structural  medium-term  growth  patterns  related  to  the increase  in  the  world's  population  and  changes  in  the  population  mix  Bain  &  Company  and  Euromonitor,  for  example, forecast growth of around 5% to 7% p.a. over the medium and long term.\n\nLastly, the Group has demonstrated in the past its ability to adapt its organization, operating methods and strategic priorities in response to changes in the macro-economic and technological environment. Its level of profitability and of cash generation allows it to invest for the long term and to weather the sector's recessionary phases, even though the downward adjustment of cost bases remains a long and complex process in an industry where the proportion of fixed operating expenses is high.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  is  involved personally in developing and implementing the anti-corruption program within Kering and its Houses, both internally and externally. He is supported by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus in his capacity as Group Managing Director and by the Board of Directors, particularly within the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, and is supported by the House CEOs, who are also personally involved in the development and implementation of the compliance program. Their collective commitment forms the 'Tone at the top' approach of Kering and its Houses. Locally, the structure of the compliance function described below allows for a 'Tone from the middle' approach implemented personally in the Regional and Houses levels by the Compliance Officers, who are mostly local managers selected in large part so that they can use their position within the Group to relay management's commitment across all levels of the organization.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Group  set  up  a  dedicated  function  responsible  for  developing  and  supervising  the  implementation  of  a compliance program meeting the requirements of France's Sapin II law, among other aspects. It is headed by the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Audit Committee. To ensure the day-to-day monitoring and effectiveness of the compliance program, the Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported by (i) a team of six compliance law experts working in  Paris,  Singapore  and  Shanghai,  (ii)  a  network  of  Brand  Compliance  Officers  appointed  by  the  Houses  CEOs,  and  (iii)  a network of Regional and Local Compliance Officers. In some Houses, there are compliance managers in addition to the Brand and Local Compliance Officers.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  compliance  program  in  place  within  Kering  and  its  Houses  meets  the  requirements  of  international standards, and more particularly the eight pillars required under Article 17 of the Sapin II law. The Group Chief Compliance Officer  attends  at  least  one  meeting  of  the  Audit  Committee  each  year  to  report  to  its  members  on  the  status  of  the compliance program and its implementation. The Audit Committee ensures that compliance risks are sufficiently mitigated and  that  the  Compliance  Officers  have  the  appropriate  resources.  The  Committee  also  discusses  the  annual  compliance objectives  to  be  assigned  by  the  Remuneration  Committee  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group Managing Director. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director also meet regularly with the Group Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n## Risk map:\n\nFollowing an initial assessment of corruption risks used to draw up a risk map in 2016-2017, which was updated in 2018, the  Group  performed  an  in-depth  assessment  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling  risks  in  its  operations  and  in  the operations of each of its Houses around the world in 2019. This assessment was run over a period of nine months by an independent specialist  law  firm  working  with  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  and  her  teams,  and  involved  more  than 242 Group employees across all regions, functions and management levels, identified by process and sub-process. To ensure that the risk assessment was comprehensive, each potential corruption and influence peddling scenario relevant to the Group was identified and assessed after analyzing first, second and third levels of control which included non-compliant hiring, cash payments, gifts, hospitality and entertainment, sponsorship and donations, relations with third parties (including real estate transactions),  discounts,  CRM  program,  inventory,  and  mergers  and  acquisitions.  The  risks  with  these  potential  corruption and influence peddling scenarios were then rated and ranked in a preliminary risk map. The action plan adopted following this risk mapping exercise was rolled out in 2021.\n\nMoreover, the corruption and influence peddling risk map was updated during 2021 to take into account the stricter controls introduced  in  2020,  as  well  as  the  findings  of  a  compliance  reviews  and  internal  audits  undertaken  in  2020  and  2021. The action plan drawn up following this update was rolled out in 2022.",

The  Code  of  Ethics,  the  anti-corruption  policy,  internal control procedures, and dedicated compliance procedures of the Group and the Houses were revised following the 2019 update of the corruption risk map. Guidelines have also been issued to assist Group employees with applying them in the situations identified as being most at risk.\n\nDue diligence procedures for all direct and indirect suppliers, acquisition targets, joint venture and consortium partners, retailers, as well as beneficiaries of sponsorships and donations, have also been tightened up so as to better prevent the risks of corruption, fraud, money laundering and violation of economic sanctions. These procedures round out the Hercules project (see section 4.2.1 of chapter 4).\n\nIn addition, employees identified as being most exposed to corruption and influence peddling risk are given customized training  to  enhance  first-level  control  over  the  new  procedures.  These  training  sessions,  which  were  delivered  to 3,568  employees  in  2022,  complement  the  mandatory  Ethics  and  Compliance  e-learning  courses  for  all  the  Group's employees, which are presented in greater detail in Chapter 4, section 2, 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business\".\n\n## \u00b7 Detection:\n\nA procedure is in place for reporting concerns and to detect potential corruption risks. The management of this system is described in greater detail in Chapter 4, section 2, 'Ethics, the cornerstone of our business'.\n\nSecond-level compliance audits to ensure the proper implementation of the compliance program and to detect corruption risks are carried out on and off site by the Group Compliance Department, with the support of an international law firm to reinforce  the  independence  and  expertise  of  the  analysis  in  the  most  at-risk  jurisdictions  identified  in  the  risk  map. Compliance  reviews  were  carried  out  in  China,  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  the  United  States,  India,  Thailand,  Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Guam, Australia and New Zealand. They gave rise to the development of local action plans to remedy the shortcomings identified. The results are also taken into account in the rating of the implementation of anti-corruption controls assessed in the regularly updated risk map.\n\nThe Internal Audit Department also regularly performs third-level audits to determine whether Group procedures, including compliance procedures are applied.\n\n## \u00b7 Remediation:\n\nCorruption risk map updates, compliance reviews and internal audits are conducted to identify potential shortcomings to a greater extent, which Kering and its Houses then remedy with the aim of continuously improving the compliance program. For example, the corruption risk identified as being the most material for the Group when the risk map was updated in 2019 relates to relationships with third parties, particularly business partners or in the context of real estate transactions. Accordingly, the Group updated in late 2019 its third-party due diligence procedure to strengthen controls over distributors, lessors and service providers involved in the creation and renovation of stores.\n\nLastly,  the  whistleblowing  system  set  up  by  the  Group  also  helps  the  Group  identify  and  take  action  to  deal  with  any misconduct.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To protect the  Group's  reputation,  the  products  sold  by  its  Houses  must  combine  distinctive  appeal  with  flawless  quality,  while  also guaranteeing absolute safety for customers. In order to bring high-quality products to market that are compliant with these standards, the Group implements quality control processes covering all of the stages in the product lifecycle, from design to marketing. Products are classified using quality and safety standards, while suppliers are listed on the basis of technical audits and  adherence  to  the  Group  Suppliers'  Charter.  Product  quality  and  safety  controls  are  carried  out  at  all  stages  of  the production process by quality engineers and accredited laboratories.\n\nThe  Product  Compliance  teams  support  the  Houses  in  developing  and  distributing  products  that  comply  with  legal requirements  in  each  market  and  with  the  Group's  Product  Restricted  Substance  List  (PRSL),  which  specifically  lists  the substances  to  be  removed  or  thresholds  not  to  be  exceeded,  as  well  as  the  highest  existing  standards  for  the disposal  of  hazardous  chemicals.  Since  2021,  the  organization  has  been  strengthened  by  the  Test  &  Innovation  Lab  (TIL), the ISO/IEC 17025 (Accredia) laboratory, which supports the testing and problem-solving activities and the R&D projects of the Group's  Houses.  In  addition,  Kering  has  committed  to  ensuring  hazardous  chemicals  are  removed  from  manufacturing processes and has drawn up a Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL).\n\nAll Kering businesses have a 'product' crisis management unit. In the event of a known risk, they follow procedures ensuring that immediate and transparent information is provided to the public, and that defective products are recalled.\n\nLastly, the Group has also taken out civil liability insurance to cover bodily harm or property damage to third parties caused by products considered defective (see section 2.7 'Insurance and risk protection' of this chapter).\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to product  quality  and  safety  are  presented  in  detail  in  section  6.1.3  'Product  conformity,  and  consumer  health  and  safety' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.",

Supply instability.\n- \u00b7 Increasing  scarcity  of  resources  associated  with  growing  demand,  impacting  the  production,  availability,  quality  and  cost of raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Illegal  mining  carried  out  by  subcontractors  who  do  not  comply  with  international  standards  or  the  Group's  standards of ethics on working conditions.\n- \u00b7 Loss of biodiversity caused by intensive livestock farming, which threatens, or may threaten, the production of high-quality raw materials. More generally, soil degradation and depletion and the destruction of biotopes represent a significant risk to the maintenance of high-quality livestock and crop farming.\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing disruptions caused by the unavailability or decreased quality of raw materials, due to climate change and its impact on biodiversity and on the destruction of land and ecosystems.\n- \u00b7 Ending a business relationship with a dependent supplier could result in that supplier experiencing financial difficulties or even insolvency, thus affecting its liquidity and ability to comply with its supply commitments.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nTo  meet  its  customers'  expectations,  the  Group  requires  unfettered  access  to  raw  materials  that  comply  with  its  quality criteria.  Kering  works  with  suppliers  and  subcontractors  across  the  supply  chain  to  secure  long-term  access  to  these  raw materials.\n\nThe Houses monitor the financial health of their suppliers using performance indicators and make sure that they identify their core suppliers. Some production lines may be internalized following detailed analysis of the main suppliers.\n\nThe Group has forged special partnerships with key suppliers and pursues a policy of actively seeking new partners. It also develops  synergies  within  the  production  chain  by  means  of  acquisitions  or  strategic  business  partnerships  in  the subcontracting market.\n\nThe Group also ensures that its suppliers and subcontractors comply with its standards in terms of ethics and responsible business conduct and in particular with its Group Suppliers' Charter, which is included in the Kering Code of Ethics. The Group ensures that its suppliers abide by the applicable laws and regulations and that its supplies meet international standards.\n\nIn addition, the Group has defined sourcing standards for all its key raw materials. First published in 2018 and updated every year since, these standards focus on five areas: social impact, environmental impact, traceability, use of chemicals and animal welfare. They serve as a guide for assessing the compliance of raw material suppliers and present two levels of expectations: minimum requirements and best practices to be achieved by 2025 at the latest, in line with the Group's sustainability strategy and its 2025 targets.\n\nTo align its practices with its commitments and drive industry-wide progress towards treatment of animals that is safer, more just and more humane, Kering believes that it has a duty to apply the highest animal welfare standards. In the sustainability strategy  adopted  by  the  Group,  the  welfare  of  animals,  and  particularly  of  livestock,  is  associated  with  environmental stewardship, safer working conditions and, more generally, a higher level of supplier performance.\n\nIn this vein, in 2019 the Group published specific standards on animal welfare to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible throughout the Group's supply chains.\n\nThe quality, safety and stability of the Group's supplies of animal and plant-based raw materials depend on strict compliance with  the  standards  in  this  regard.  First  and  foremost  with  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species of  Wild  Fauna and Flora (CITES) and on the sustained equilibrium of ecosystems, some of which are already under threat. To meet the crucial challenges related to biodiversity, its preservation and restoration, the Group published its biodiversity strategy in 2020, setting new specific and ambitious objectives aimed at achieving a 'net positive impact' on biodiversity by 2025.  Measures  taken  include  the  launch  of  the  Kering  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  created  by  Kering  and  Conservation International to support the fashion industry's transition to regenerative agriculture and the 2022 launch of the Climate Fund for Nature.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to the Group's raw materials and the protection of biodiversity are presented in detail in section 5.3 'Preserving biodiversity ecosystems and natural resources' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  House  is  implementing a refurbishment program to make sure its stores remain eye-catching and productive.\n\nA profitability study and an assessment of the strategic and operational benefits are carried out prior to every investment decision related to the network. One-off studies may be carried out two or three years after the investment to ensure the business plan has been executed properly.\n\nIn  addition,  Houses  track  their  main  retail  indicators  closely  and  regularly  to  anticipate  any  store  optimization  decisions, such as, for example, increased staffing levels in the stores, extensions or overhaul of the retail space.\n\nWithin the framework of the wholesale distribution network, contracts are regularly reviewed by the Houses' teams with the support of the Group's Legal Department to ensure each House's distribution network is optimal and efficient. In addition, a team from Kering's Finance Department tracks the solvency of all the Group's wholesale accounts and monitors payment collection.\n\nSince  late  2019,  the  Group  has  been  streamlining  the  wholesale  channel.  This  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  revenue  and, in certain cases, especially for the e-tailers, a conversion to a concession format.\n\nThe Group prevents sales of its products by parallel distribution networks by ensuring the traceability of its goods, prohibiting direct sales to these networks (gray market) and implementing specific measures to tighten control over these distribution channels.",

Business continuity and recovery plans are regularly updated, and their efficacy closely monitored.\n\nWith the support of the Houses' security departments, the Group is introducing data protection and business continuity plans.\n\nAs part of the introduction of data protection governance in compliance with the GDPR and other data protection regulations, the Group Data Privacy Officer is involved in these initiatives.\n\nThe following actions are implemented every year to assess the level of compliance of the Group's information systems:\n\n- \u00b7 penetration testing (pentests) on applications and simulated logical/physical attacks (Red Team);\n- \u00b7 network vulnerability scans and applications;\n- \u00b7 continuous cloud infrastructure audits;\n- \u00b7 review of patch management procedures and obsolescence management;\n- \u00b7 review of backup procedures.\n\nThe Group has increased IT security, notably through a transformation plan, and stepped up employee awareness initiatives by  implementing  a  large  number  of  control  and  protection  measures,  including  establishing  procedures,  and  developing targeted IT security systems. All employees have been trained to detect malicious emails, including via phishing simulation exercises conducted throughout the year. Moreover, the Group has developed e-learning modules on cybersecurity and data confidentiality, in addition to one on security and remote working. Best security practices in various areas (phishing, malware, passwords, etc.) were also circulated via the Group's various internal communication channels during 2022, with a special campaign held during cybersecurity month in October.\n\nThe Group has taken significant steps to protect customer and employee data:\n\n- \u00b7 customer data used in non-production environments is anonymized;\n- \u00b7 access to customer data is restricted to authorized persons;\n- \u00b7 risk assessments are carried out on all projects implemented by the Group in order to identify requirements in terms of data security, confidentiality, integrity, traceability and availability, and thereby define the appropriate security measures;\n- \u00b7 non-disclosure agreements are signed with external service providers and security clauses are included in the Group's contracts with suppliers;\n- \u00b7 a customer identity management platform has been acquired in order to secure the authentication process.\n\nTo manage security incidents that could have an impact on personal data or more broadly on operations, the Group has set up a  Security Operating Center on hand 24/7 and responsible for detecting and resolving security threats and events, such as identity fraud, malware and information leaks.\n\nIn  addition,  the  information  systems  department  (Kering  Technologies)  regularly  conducts  audits  on  key  applications  and information systems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, it uses derivatives either to hedge foreign currency trade receivables and payables, or to hedge highly probable forecast exposures and/or firm commitments.\n\nHedging periods are aligned with each House's business cycle and only marginally exceed one year at each reporting date.\n\nThe Group also hedges foreign exchange risk on financial assets and liabilities issued in foreign currencies by using currency swaps for refinancing purposes or by investing cash in euros or local currency.\n\nNote 19.2 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the nature of the hedging instruments held by the Group and its exposure to foreign exchange risk ('Exposure and sensitivity to foreign exchange risk').\n\nKering Finance SNC processes, controls and provides administrative support for foreign exchange transactions on behalf of Group companies. Its organization into front-office, middle-office, back-office and accounting departments ensures that tasks are  properly  segregated,  transactions  are  kept  secure  and  derivatives  contracted  internally  are  unwound  on  the  market. Kering Finance SNC uses market-standard techniques and information systems to price currency instruments.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe Group trades in its own securities either directly or through derivatives as part of its share buyback program in accordance with applicable regulations. Kering has also entered into an agreement with a financial intermediary to foster the liquidity and maintain the regular quotation of its shares. This agreement complies with the Professional Code of Conduct drawn up by the  French  association  of  financial  markets  (Association  fran\u00e7aise  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  -  AMAFI)  and  approved  by  the French financial markets authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Kering held 1,850,408 treasury shares, representing just 1.5% of its share capital and confirming its low level of exposure in this regard. Kering also retained a 3% interest in PUMA, further reducing its exposure compared to previous reporting periods.\n\nAdditional information on equity risk is provided in Note 19.3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nKering may need to use derivatives such as swaps or purchases of options to guard against changes in interest rates.

According to the Group entities' experts and advisors, no litigation currently in progress concerning Group companies presents a risk  for  the  normal  course  of  the  Group's  business  or  its  future  development.  Provisions  were  set  aside  in  the  Group's  2022 consolidated financial statements to cover all of the above-mentioned legal risks, including the impact of commitments given on the disposal of controlling interests (see Note 22). None of these risks have been qualified as arising outside the normal course of business for Group companies.\n\nThe Group considers that the effective methods and procedures for identifying and managing its industrial and environmental risks  within  each  of  the  entities  concerned,  which  rely  chiefly  on  the  advice  of  duly  authorized  external  organizations  and advisors,  meet,  in  terms  of  relevance  and  proportion,  customary  technical  and  professional  standards  under  the  prevailing regulatory framework. An active prevention and safety policy are an integral part of these methods and procedures.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  has  granted  various  vendor  representations  and  warranties  in  connection  with  disposals  of controlling interests in subsidiaries made over the last ten years (see Note 22).\n\nAs regards the laws and regulations applicable to the Group's activities (excluding possible international sanctions that may be imposed  against  certain  countries  but  have  no  impact  on  the  Group's  activities),  none  are  subject  to  specific  rules  or exemptions in any of the relevant territories. They are all subject to the same constraints and obligations as those directly applicable to its competitors on its different markets.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any foreseeable regulatory or legislative changes in contradiction with the foregoing.\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  during  the  last  12  months  or  more,  there  have  been  no  governmental,  legal,  or  arbitration proceedings (including any pending or threatened proceedings of which the issuer is aware) that have had in the recent past, or are likely to have in the future, a significant impact on the financial position or earnings of the issuer or the Group.",

In all cases, any such licensing agreements have been entered into under fair commercial and financial terms and conditions and have no impact on the ownership of the trademarks and signs belonging to the Group.\n\nFurther  information  on  contractual  obligations  and  other  commitments  is  provided  in  Note  28  to  the  2022  consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has strengthened its teams, particularly in the Legal Department and the shared services centers, to ensure that contracts  have  been  properly  set  up  with  the  Group's  suppliers.  Since  2015,  the  Hercules  program  has  strengthened  the shared and, standardized approach to supply chain management between the Houses.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nThe  Kering  group  regards  intellectual  property  used  in  the  creative  and  innovation  processes  of  its  Houses  as  crucially important and has established a master intellectual property protection and defense policy adhered to by the Group's Houses.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  the  Group  has  formed  and  retains  legal  organizations  at  regional  (Asia,  the  Americas  and  Europe), local (Houses and subsidiaries) and central levels specialized in intellectual property management.\n\nIn line with the general directives introduced by Kering, the Legal departments of the Group's Houses take steps to make sure products do not infringe the rights of third parties and determine which elements need protecting. The intellectual property rights portfolio is reviewed and updated on a regular basis to reflect and protect the activities of the Group's Houses.\n\nLastly, Kering works to protect its rights and campaigns against counterfeiting in all its markets, as this can have an impact on revenue and damage the reputation of the Group and its products.\n\nThe Group takes steps to combat the various breaches of its rights, the sale and trafficking of counterfeit goods or copied goods, as well as imitations that devalue the creative work of the Houses.\n\nIn physical markets, this policy is implemented through customs seizures, police raids and legal action and on the internet by withdrawals of advertising and investigations followed by litigation.\n\nLitigation  is  overseen  by  the  Houses'  Legal  departments,  according  to  the  general  policy  principles  recommended  by  the Group with the help of the Group's legal units and external advisors, in conjunction with the competent authorities at local level (subsidiaries).\n\nThe cost of protecting rights is borne by the legal functions and aligned with the Group's scale and size.\n\nCompliance with the statutory framework protecting personal data\n\nThe Kering Group's Houses process customer data that are of high commercial value. To curb the risk of inappropriate use of these data and to comply with the relevant legislation, the Kering Group's Houses have taken further measures to tighten up the protection of personal data within their commercial and digital strategy. The Privacy Framework is an internal framework in which the Houses are stakeholders through executive-level engagement. It paves the way for implementation of a coherent worldwide strategy protecting personal data. The various data controllers face many challenges in view of cross-border issues and growing complexity of the legal framework for the protection of personal data.\n\nThe  Kering  Group's  activities  operate  under  constantly  changing  rules  that  vary  from  location  to  location.  The  Group  has increased the size of its Privacy team to address this priority and expand its data protection capabilities. It now consists of regional  managers  (Europe,  Middle  East  and  Africa,  Asia-Pacific  and  Americas)  and  dedicated  managers  for  a  number  of countries.\n\n- \u00b7 There has been a proliferation of new, more complex privacy rules in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with the adoption of new legal frameworks in several states during 2022. Further significant developments are anticipated in 2023. These  include  an  overhaul  of  the  UK  General  Regulation  on  Data  Protection  (GDPR)  and  the  potential  adoption  by  the European Commission of a new mechanism for lawfully transferring data from the European Union to the United States.\n- \u00b7 In  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  the  Houses  have  undertaken  various  initiatives  to  comply  with  China's  Personal  Information Protection  Law  (PIPL)  and  seeking  government  approval  for  cross-border  personal  data  transfers.  These  efforts  will continue in 2023.\n- \u00b7 In the Americas region, maintaining a tight grip on data processing activities has become imperative in view of the growing corpus of applicable law and the scale of the Group's operations. Special attention is paid to this issue in the United States where the relevant and state-level legislation is both complex and evolving.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly,  the  Group  embarked  on  a  number  of  projects, ranging  from  an  overhaul  of  consent  forms  to  a  review  of  contractual  commitments  and  introduction  of  a  standardized process for assessing risk and legislation related to data transfers.\n\nSince  supporting  customers  is  a  central  concern  of  the  Houses,  the  Group  set  up  in  2022  a  shared  service  guaranteeing effective and rules-compliant management of requests by individuals to exercise their right to access, correct, object to the processing  and  delete  the  information  gathered.  The  Houses  reported  a  significant  increase  in  requests  to  exercise  these rights (up 26% in 2022), and so additional resources had to be allocated. The service is now provided to the Houses to ensure, on their behalf, that all requests received are processed rapidly and rigorously, regardless of the channel by which they are received and the type of request involved.\n\nKering and its Houses have set about making sure all practices involving traceability tools (e.g. cookies) are compliant through regular audits and ongoing analysis of the new regulations in this domain, especially in the United States and in China.\n\nLastly,  Kering  introduced  mandatory  training  in  2021  with  the  aim  of  developing  an  internal  culture  that  makes  privacy a priority concern and genuinely addresses IT security issues head-on.",

Kering is also committed to ensuring that all Group entities pay all of the taxes due in each of the countries where they operate.\n\nTo that end, Kering can rely on a team of tax specialists in each of its regions and at its headquarters. They are highly skilled and receive regular training to keep their knowledge up to date.\n\nTo understand the various tax-related issues that may arise, the Group Tax Department's main tasks are:\n\n- \u00b7 consolidating tax information from all Group companies;\n- \u00b7 understanding  and  monitoring  tax  issues  that  arise  at  national  or  international  level  and  coordinating  responses in compliance with the applicable laws and standards;\n- \u00b7 ensuring that intra-group transactions are documented as required;\n- \u00b7 providing technical support on tax-related matters during the preparation of consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Tax Department has therefore implemented a number of verification and control tools to help identify and resolve any tax issues  that  may  arise  within  the  Group  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  applicable  national  tax  laws  and  international standards. These tools include: regular analyses of comparable information to ensure that intra-group transactions are carried out  on  an  arm's  length  basis;  annual  reviews  of  Group  entities;  and  close,  detailed  monitoring  of  any  tax  audits  to  which Group entities are subject.\n\nIn addition, the Tax Department actively ensures that all Group entities:\n\n- \u00b7 allocate all the physical, digital and human resources necessary to conduct their business;\n- \u00b7 only have a presence in countries where they actually conduct business;\n- \u00b7 comply  with  the  applicable  national  laws  and  international  standards  on  transfer  pricing.  To  this  end,  it  develops  and updates  all  of  the  necessary  documentation  in  this  regard  and  provides  the  relevant  resources,  such  as  analyses  of comparable transactions and functional analyses;\n- \u00b7 cooperate  fully  with  local  tax  authorities  and  government  agencies  and,  where  relevant,  share  their  experience and expertise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Potential loss of know-how among the Group's teams or among the craftspeople and manufacturers within the supply chain or the communities from which the Group sources key and/or specific raw materials.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Departure of senior executives:  inability  to  find,  in  a  timely  manner,  a  suitable  successor  for  an  Executive  Management position  (Chairman/Chief  Executive  Officer,  Group  Managing  Director,  Executive  Committee  member),  as  the  result  of departure or incapacity.\n- \u00b7 Unexpected departure of a Creative Director, leading to a period of uncertainty that could have a significant impact on the brand (particularly in terms of image and reputation, asset write-offs, etc.). Any luxury goods company may have to face and manage this risk at some time.\n- \u00b7 Dilution of technical craftsmanship in transformation, cutting and assembly. Extinction of traditional crafts.\n- \u00b7 Difficulty to keep talent: loss of key employees to competitors.\n- \u00b7 The luxury industry is supported by numerous manufacturing communities worldwide. They are subject to the risk of social, economic and operational tensions, such as community problems, disruptions to production and a shrinking talent pool.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nKering's Human resources policy aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish a long-term hiring strategy through international partnerships with schools and training organizations, and thus attract the best talent;\n- \u00b7 create a work environment that is motivating, collaborative, inclusive and respectful of each individual;\n- \u00b7 encourage commitment to the Group and its values through training programs, talent management and an appropriate remuneration policy;\n- \u00b7 promote inclusion, diversity and gender equality;\n- \u00b7 pay constant attention to working conditions, employee well-being and work-life balance;\n- \u00b7 develop internal mobility and opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\nKering  has  set  itself  the  priority  of  developing  talent  and  has  therefore  put  in  place  tools  and  processes  geared  towards helping  employees  constantly  expand  their  career  prospects  and  strengthen  their  skills  through  mobility  and  career opportunities.\n\nSince  2018,  Kering  has  developed  a  single  digital  platform  for  all  employees  worldwide,  enabling  it  to  standardize management processes and simplify and speed up the data sharing required to manage talent globally, in a more transparent way.\n\nSince 2019, weekly updates have been made available on the communication platform for all employees giving them a clear picture  of  the  vacancies  within  the  various  Houses.  A  new  communication  campaign  encouraging  internal  mobility was launched in 2021 and continued in 2022. An employee survey was conducted in April 2021 covering the entire workforce to measure staff engagement and build a Group-wide action plan, which was unveiled in September 2021. Each House then adapted it to fit its own specific environment, including the countries in which it operates.\n\nThese measures included strengthening the well-being policies (already being piloted within the Houses) and ongoing efforts to support employees with mental health issues.\n\nSince its  launch  in  2020,  the  Baby  Leave  policy  has  entitled  all  employees  worldwide  to  14  weeks'  leave  on  full  pay  upon becoming parents, including fathers and partners, and is now an integral part of the employee experience.\n\nEmployee  commitment  lies  at  the  heart  of  Kering's  values.  Under  the  Giving  Back  program  in  France,  Italy  and  the  United Kingdom (21 hours per year) and the global Gucci Changemakers program, employees are able to give time during their working hours  to  a  charitable  cause  in  line  with  Kering's  values.  This  program  makes  work  more  meaningful  and  helps  to  develop an environment nurturing engagement with society. In 2022, Kering Corporate launched Women in Luxury (WIL), its first internal network championing gender equality and promoting women's role in the Group.\n\nTo maintain the know-how of its luxury businesses over the long term, Kering runs personnel training and skills preservation initiatives  and  has  internalized  a  number  of  functions  that  were  previously  subcontracted.  Talent  development  is  a cornerstone  of  Kering's  HR  policy,  and  training  is  one  of  its  key  levers.  With  Kering  Learning,  the  Group  now  has  a  digital training  platform  for  all  employees  providing  a  shared  foundation  for  all  Houses.  Training  is  accessible  in  multi-channel formats, making content more accessible via mobile.\n\nA talent review is also carried out each year by the Executive Committee -the starting point for the succession plan for key positions within the Group, as set out in section 2.2.6 of Chapter 3.",

That can trigger complaints from the Group's employees, its partners or stakeholders and potentially compromise the Group's image and reputation.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Child labor and forced labor.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with standards for migrant workers.\n- \u00b7 Poor working conditions.\n- \u00b7 Excessive working hours.\n- \u00b7 Salary levels not providing a living wage.\n- \u00b7 Hazardous working conditions or conditions failing to keep workers safe and healthy.\n- \u00b7 Harassment and violence.\n- \u00b7 Mining operations that are illegal or in conflict zones.\n- \u00b7 Inequality of opportunity and discrimination.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with the rights of local communities.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nThe  protection  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  for  Kering  employees  and  all  participants  in  the  value  chains  of the Group and its Houses, is a core commitment, supported by management at the highest level.\n\nThis commitment is central to Kering's identity and reflects the community of values created by the Group, its Houses and their stakeholders.\n\nAs a Group that aims to create sustainable, responsible Luxury goods, Kering must identify and manage human rights-related risks in its sphere of influence (operations and supply chain) as rapidly and as resolutely as possible. By working in partnership with its suppliers and stakeholders to curb these risks and by sharing best practices, Kering protects the reputation of the Group and its Houses and maintains the appeal of their creations.\n\nThis vital undertaking is set out in the Group's Code of Ethics, in particular the aspects relating to fundamental freedoms and human rights in the Group's Suppliers' Charter, which is included in the Code, and in the Sustainability Principles for suppliers. These documents are part of the contractual framework governing relationships with suppliers.\n\nA Human Rights policy has also been drafted at Group level and covers both Kering's operations and its supply chains.\n\nIn  2017,  Kering  mapped  the  risks  specific  to  its  own  activities  and  those  of  its  supply  chain,  as  well  as  conducting  a  gap analysis pinpointing differences between the Group's internal practices and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In 2020, Kering carried out an internal risk assessment to identify and evaluate human rights-related risks linked to the sourcing of certain key raw materials. In 2021, Kering carried out a second, more in-depth assessment of the risks related to human rights and fundamental freedoms concerning its activities and its supply chain. The assessments were also incorporated in the Group's overall map, and an action plan was rolled out to address areas for improvement detected during this exercise. The risk map was updated in 2021, with another update scheduled in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the whistleblowing system is open to everyone working for the Group: employees and interns of Kering and its Houses, as well as external and temporary personnel working for external partners or service providers under contract with the Group. It can be  used  to  report  any  suspected  violation  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  within  the  Group  and  its  supply  chains. An information and communication campaign was rolled out in 2020 and repeated in 2021 to provide the direct suppliers of the Group's Houses and their employees with a reminder of the Group's key ethical principles, particularly with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms, and of the existence of the Group's ethics whistleblowing system, which is at their disposal.\n\nLastly,  a  collaborative  portal  introduced  in  2020  optimizes  communication  between  Kering  and  its  suppliers.  The  aim  is  to  provide suppliers  with  easy  access  to  training  and  key  Kering  documents -including  on  human  rights -and  also  to  evaluate  suppliers' performance  through  questionnaires  in  a  number  of  key  areas,  including  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms.  The  supplier integration and training drive continued actively in 2022, with the system now covering all the direct suppliers of Kering and its Houses.\n\nIn addition, the Group has adopted a stringent control strategy in the area of human rights, which includes but is not limited to the social audits conducted each year across thousands of Group suppliers and service providers.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms are presented in section 3 'Duty of care plan' in this Chapter and in section 2.5 'Protection of human rights' of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lack  of  foresight,  resilience  or  Group initiatives in response to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Supply chain: the higher frequency of extreme weather events (drought, water scarcity, flooding, etc.) could have a direct impact on the availability and quality of key raw materials such as cotton, leather, cashmere and silk, which would translate into greater price volatility, and may thus affect the production and distribution of finished products.\n- \u00b7 Economic  activity  and  even  the  social  stability  of  certain  regions  (such  as  coastal  regions  in  Asia)  could  be  severely impacted by the effects of climate change, which would further increase pressure on the Group's supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Physical  impacts  of  climate  change  related  to  extreme  meteorological  events  (drought,  flooding,  etc.)  at  certain  Group installations (production and storage sites, stores, etc.) potentially disrupting the continuity of operations.\n- \u00b7 Stricter  environmental  regulations  and  standards  to  meet  the  challenges  associated  with  climate  change,  carbon  tax potentially having an impact on the Group's activities by increasing production costs and reducing operational flexibility.\n- \u00b7 Inaccurate forecasting of consumer demand for responsible products.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nIn the global economic and political outlook, climate change has become a key issue that demands an effective response.\n\nKering's approach to tackling climate change is part of a double-materiality drive, in line with the Group's goal of reducing the impact of its  operations  and,  secondly,  to  enhance  its  foresight  and  ability  to  adapt  so  that  it  can  mitigate  the  impact  of physical  and  transition  risks  on  its  business  (shifting  consumer  expectations,  physical  risks  to  its  installations,  impact  on sourcing of its raw materials, etc.).\n\nThe Group has set very ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint by 2025 under its Climate Strategy. Kering was the first Luxury group to be verified and approved in 2017 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets. These were revised in 2020 and validated in 2021 to align them with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario by 2030, in keeping with the commitments made as part of the Fashion Pact. In addition, Kering aims to be a net-zero company by 2050.\n\nKering published its Climate strategy in 2021 setting out in detail the commitments, objectives and actions implemented by the Group to reduce its carbon footprint, enhance the energy efficiency of its operations and make its supply chains more resilient, starting with the introduction of the Environmental Profit and Loss (EP&L) statement. This tool first introduced in 2012 allows Kering to measure its environmental impacts, including its carbon footprint, throughout the value chain and to monetize them. Beyond the risk management dimension, the EP&L is also used as a management tool to orient the Group towards sustainable sourcing solutions and to assess the raw materials used in product design.\n\nTo reach the next level, Kering decided in 2022 to improve the governance of the Group's efforts to combat climate change through the appointment of a Climate Change Lead within the Board of Directors and to set up a department responsible for sustainable finance.\n\nThe physical effects of climate change could impact the Group's operations. A report entitled 'Climate change: implications and strategies for the fashion and luxury sector' jointly authored in 2015 with BSR analyzed exposure to climate risk, focusing on  climate  risks  threatening  cotton,  cashmere,  vicu\u00f1a  wool,  and  silk,  as  well  as  cow,  calf,  sheep  and  lambskin  leather. Furthermore,  Kering  abides  by  the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD), of  which  it  has  been  a  member  since  2017.  Since  2020,  the  Group  has  published  a  table  cross-referencing  these recommendations. In 2021, it extended the assessment of climate change risk for its activities by incorporating scenario-based analysis.\n\nIn addition to its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the Group has offset all residual emissions in Scopes 1 and 2 since 2012. Since 2019, it has pledged to offset all residual Scope 3 emissions (including supply chain emissions) through carbon credits with certified REDD+ projects. In 2022, the Group offset 100% of its overall carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 calculated via the EP&L tool - excluding product use and end of life) for 2021, just as it did in 2021 for 2020. To plan ahead for its carbon offsets, Kering launched the Climate Fund for Nature in 2022, which aims to protect and restore nature. It is working towards a target of \u20ac300 million in total commitments, of which \u20ac140 million had been made by the end of 2022.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to climate change and the Group's Climate strategy are presented in detail in section 5.2 \"Combating climate change\" of Chapter 4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.",

To  this  end,  each  of  Kering's  Houses  has  a  crisis management policy and unit that liaises with headquarters.\n\nThe  Group  also  monitors  adherence  by  personnel  to  the  Kering  group  Charter,  which  defines  the  framework  for  the decentralization of the organization, and to the Code of Ethics, which is available in 14 languages and was last circulated to all employees in 2019 after being updated in 2018. A Group Ethics Committee has been established and is supported by two regional counterparts, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) Ethics Committee and the Americas Ethics Committee. Together, they ensure compliance with the Code of Ethics and respond to all inquiries, from simple ethics-related questions to the management of complaints about potential non-compliance with the Code. The Compliance team also assists and guides employees to ensure compliance with prevailing legal requirements, including those relating to corruption and competition law. The three Ethics Committees, the Compliance team and the ethics hotline form Kering's whistleblowing framework. All the Group's employees worldwide, as well as employees of the suppliers and partners under contract with the Group and/or its Houses, may use the whistleblowing system.\n\nEach year, a mandatory Ethics & Compliance e-learning program is provided for all Group employees around the world to remind them about the fundamentals of ethics and their obligations in this regard. It presents real-world examples of ethical dilemmas,  enabling  employees  to  test  their  ability  to  question,  discern  and  judge  different  situations.  It  also  provides an opportunity to remind employees about the Group's whistleblowing system.\n\nAt the same time, the Group ensures that its suppliers adhere to the Group Suppliers' Charter. They are required to promote within their production units and among their own subcontractors. Compliance is also measured through social audits. This Charter is included in the Code of Ethics and was therefore also updated and circulated to suppliers again in 2019. A further step was taken in 2020 and repeated in 2021 with the launch of a communication campaign specifically targeting the direct suppliers of the Group, its Houses and their various employees. Available in 15 languages, it aims to ensure that suppliers' employees are aware of the Group's key commitments and ethical principles, enshrined in the Kering Code of Ethics, as well as of the existence of the Kering whistleblowing system, which is at their disposal, as well as why, when and how to use it.\n\nAll  of  the  Group's  Houses  implement  appropriate  methods  and  steps  to  ensure  their  activities  comply  with  the  Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards: SA8000 and RJC certification, social audits and supplier training programs are examples of the actions and programs that the Houses have put in place in their day-to-day operations.\n\nThe policies, projects and actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to ethics  and  global  governance  are  presented  in  detail  in  section  2  'Ethics,  the  cornerstone  of  our  business'  of  Chapter  4 'Sustainability' of this Universal Registration Document.",

This assessment  takes  account  of  the  analyses  of  the  insurers underwriting the Group's risks.\n\nThe  insurance  programs  now  in  force  in  the  Group,  which centralize  most  purchases  of  insurance  policies  such  as property  and  casualty  risks  for  subsidiaries,  were  subscribed with reputable insurers in the industrial risk insurance sector. The Group  was  assisted  by  internationally recognized insurance brokers specialized in covering major risks.\n\nMain existing insurance programs:\n\n- \u00b7 property  damage  from  fire,  explosion,  floods,  machine breakage,  natural  disasters  affecting  its  own  property: property, furnishings, equipment, merchandise, IT installations,  and  property  for  which  it  is  responsible, as  well  as  any  resulting  operating  losses,  for  any  period deemed necessary for normal business activities to resume;\n- \u00b7 damage and loss of equipment, merchandise and/or goods in transit;\n- \u00b7 damage resulting from theft, fraud, embezzlement, or acts of malice to valuable assets, data and/or property;\n- \u00b7 bodily harm or property damage following construction work carried  out  as  project  owner  (new  buildings,  renovations, refurbishments, etc.);\n- \u00b7 liability  for  bodily  or  property  damage  to  third  parties  by motorized vehicles belonging to the different Houses;\n- \u00b7 general and environmental liability for 'operating risk', 'postdelivery risk' and 'risk after services rendered', due to damage caused to third parties in the course of the Group's business;\n\n- \u00b7 non-payment  of  receivables by third-party retailers, particularly in the event of default or insolvency;\n- \u00b7 cyberattacks targeting the Group's data and/or other assets.\n\nOther insurance contracts are taken out by Group companies to cover specific risks or to comply with local regulations.\n\nUninsured  risks  are  exposures  for  which  no  insurance coverage  is  offered  on  the  insurance  market,  or  for  which the cost of available insurance is disproportionate compared to the potential benefits of the coverage.\n\nThe Kering group handles known and manageable risks given the current scientific and medical understanding in a manner consistent  with  other  French  and  international  industrial groups  with  similar  types  of  exposures.  This  is  one  of  the reasons why the Group is able to place its risks with insurers prepared  to  deal  with  the  unforeseeable  and  uncertain consequences of accidents.\n\nInsurance coverage concerns all Group companies.\n\nThe  levels  of  coverage  in  place  for  the  main  potential  risks facing  the  Group  as  a  whole  as  of  January  1,  2022,  were  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 damage, fire, explosions or water damage and the ensuing operating  losses:  \u20ac300  million  increased  to  \u20ac500  million for the Group's major sites;\n- \u00b7 general liability: \u20ac145 million;\n- \u00b7 damage to or loss of goods in transit: \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 fraud  and  acts  of  malice  to  goods  and  valuables: \u20ac15 million.\n\nThe  total  risk  financing  cost  for  Kering  includes  three  main items  (in  addition  to  'physical'  protection  and  prevention expenditure). It breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 cost of deductibles and non-insured losses retained or selfinsured by the subsidiaries in 2022: \u20ac1.5 million;\n- \u00b7 claims covered by the Group itself through its reinsurance company in 2022: \u20ac5 million (total  estimated  at  year-end 2022).\n- Self-insurance by the Group's reinsurance  subsidiary reduces insurance costs and  enhances  performance because (i) frequently occurring risks are pooled within the Group and insured for an amount that is fixed per claim and (ii)  exceptionally  frequent claims made in a given year are covered by reinsurance.\n- As  of  July  1,  2022,  the  Group's  reinsurance  company covered damage and operating losses of up to \u20ac3 million per  claim,  or  more  on  natural  events  in  exposed  regions (for the period from July 1 to June 30);\n- \u00b7 insurance  premiums  budgets  and  management  fees including  engineering  visits  and  brokers  fees,  etc.  (final budget 2022 expenses): \u20ac20.5 million.\n\nThere is also a credit insurance budget of around \u20ac1.6 million covering  non-payment  risks  related  to  sales  to  retailers (duty-free  chains,  department  stores,  specialized  retailers, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  latest  version  of  the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics, released in 2018, is closely aligned with the major international  conventions  on  human  rights,  fundamental freedoms  and  environmental  protection,  and  sets  forth  the core  commitments  of  Kering's  approach  related  thereto. In this respect, Kering considers the requirements of the Duty of Care Law to be an integral part of its ethical commitments and undertakes to ensure compliance with these requirements throughout both its operations and its supply chain.\n\nIn  2017,  Kering  prepared  a  first  duty  of  care  plan  which included a mapping of the relevant risks. Since its adoption in 2017, Kering has updated its duty of care plan on an annual basis.  In  2021,  Kering  performed  a  new  and  more  in-depth assessment of the risks covered by the Duty of Care Law to see whether,  and  to  what  extent,  such  risks  had  evolved  since 2017. A significant number of internal stakeholders (including from the Human Resources, Sustainability, Legal, Compliance, and Audit Departments of the Group and select Houses) were involved  in  the  risk  mapping  and  preparation  of  the  duty  of care  plan  (the  'Duty  of  Care  Plan').  External  legal  advisors provided assistance to ensure they acted in a fully independent manner and had all the relevant expertise to hand.\n\nKering's Duty of Care Plan is built around the five components established by the Duty of Care Law. More generally, Kering's Duty  of  Care  Plan  presents  an  overview  of  the  actions  that Kering  has  undertaken  over  a  number  of  years  to  act  as  a responsible company.\n\nUnder  the  Duty  of  Care  Law,  such  companies  are  obliged  to draw  up,  publish,  and  effectively  implement  a  duty  of  care plan  designed  to  detect  and  prevent  the  risks  of  a  severe impact  on  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  severe harm  to  the  health  and  safety  of  individuals,  and  serious environmental  damage,  resulting  from  the  operations  of (i)  the  company,  (ii)  its  subsidiaries  and  other  controlled entities  (as  defined  in  paragraph  II  of  Article  L.  233-16  of French Commercial Code) or (iii) its suppliers or subcontractors.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2 Risk mapping\n\nAs noted above, the 2021  risk mapping  involved  a combination  of  internal  and  external  resources.  Led  by  the Group Chief Compliance Officer on behalf of Kering, the 2021 risk mapping assessed relevant risks within Kering's operations as well as those of Gucci and Boucheron. Gucci was selected  to  represent  Kering's  Fashion  &  Leather  Goods\n\nDivision and Italian Houses. This choice also reflected Gucci's expertise  and  activities  in  the  areas  relevant  to  the  exercise and  in  light  of  its  contribution  to  the  Group's  activities. Boucheron was selected to represent Kering's Jewelry Division and French Houses.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scope\n\nThe  following  risks  were  identified  and  evaluated  as  part of the risk mapping exercise:\n\n- 1. Forced Working\n- - Child Labor\n- - Forced Labor/Debt Bondage/Illegal, Clandestine or Undeclared Employment/Migrant Labor/Human Trafficking\n- 2. Discrimination and Harassment\n- - Diversity\n- - Discrimination\n- - Women's Rights\n- - Psychological or Sexual Harassment/Violence\n- 3. Absence of Dialogue\n- - Freedom of Association/Right to Collective Bargaining\n- 4. Decent Working Conditions\n- - Right to a Living Wage/Fair Wages\n- - Working Hours\n- - Dignity at Work/Mental Well-Being\n\n## 3.2.2 Methodology\n\nThe risks listed above were assessed separately with respect to (i) Kering's,  Gucci's,  and  Boucheron's  internal  operations, (ii)  the  operations  of  their  first  level  suppliers,  and  (iii)  the sourcing  of  raw  materials.  This  risk  mapping  evaluated the gross risk and calculated net risk by evaluating and scoring the relevant controls in place.\n\nFirst, gross risks related to internal operations were assessed separately  per  country  based  on  a  combination  of  objective factors (number of employees, production sites, warehouses, and  stores  located  in  each  country  of  operations)  and third-party  supplied  indices  and  databases  covering  specific countries and specific risks (varying for each risk and including among many others the Human Freedom Index, ITUC Global Rights  Index,  the  Environmental  Performance  Index  and  the Animal Protection  Index)  assessing  the  potential  impact  and the likelihood of occurrence.\n\nSecond,  gross  risks  related  to  the  operations  of  first  level suppliers  were  assessed  based  on  the  number  of  suppliers per  country  and  the  respective  sales  for  Kering,  Gucci  and Boucheron, which were once again combined with third-party supplied  indices  and  databases  covering  specific  countries and specific risks.\n\n- 5. Health and safety at work\n- - Safe and Hygienic Working Conditions\n- - Chemicals/Hazardous Substances\n- 6. Pollution\n- - Energy Use\n- - Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change\n- 7. Waste and Packaging\n- - Waste and Packaging\n- 8. Water Use\n- - Water Consumption\n- - Wastewater Treatment\n- 9. Animals & Biodiversity Abuse\n- - Animal Protection\n- - Preservation of Biodiversity\n- 10. Local Communities Abuses\n- - Land Rights/Forced Eviction and Displacement of Populations\n- - Cultural Heritage/Local Communities\n\nFinally,  gross  risks  related  to  the  sourcing  of  raw  materials were assessed on the aggregate percentage of select strategic risk  raw  materials  sourced  by  Kering,  Gucci,  and  Boucheron from a given country and six country-specific general indices. The  assessment  also  took  into  account  two  magnifying factors,  i.e.  the  inclusion  of  the  country  (i)  in  the  U.S. Department  of  Labor  lists  of  countries  producing  goods and products that are believed to be produced by child labor and/or forced labor, and/or (ii) in the list of conflict-affected and high-risk countries under E.U. Regulation No. 2017/821.\n\nThe  respective  net  risks  of  the  above  three  categories  were then obtained by evaluating and scoring the relevant controls in place.\n\nIt should be noted that a distinction was made, to accurately identify  risks,  between  the  risks  to  which  Kering,  Gucci,  and Boucheron expose their stakeholders (as required by the Duty of  Care  Law)  and  the  risks  to  which  Kering,  Gucci,  and Boucheron are exposed because of their activities (for inclusion in the Group's general risk mapping). More specifically, the assessment of the gross risks for Kering, Gucci  and  Boucheron  also  took  into  account  the  potential reputational, financial and legal/compliance impact.\n\nOverall,  the  exercise  involved  interviews  with  37  Group employees, a review of over 400 documents, and the scoring of  thousands  of  country-specific  risks  based  on  47  third party-supplied risk indices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Relevant  risks  are  further  mitigated by multiple controls and primarily by the introduction of the Hercules management system (described below), which covers the onboarding of suppliers and their subcontractors as well as the monitoring of their performance throughout the entire contractual relationship.\n\nThe  controls  in  place  to  limit  relevant  risks  within  the remainder of the supply chain, including with respect to the\n\nsourcing and traceability of raw material, consist primarily in implementing the requirements set forth by the Sustainability Principles  and  the  Kering  Standards,  as  well  as  in  the certifications obtained by suppliers.\n\n## 3.2.4 Monitoring and updating\n\nFollowing  the  establishment  of  its  latest  risk  map  in  2021, Kering has regularly monitored human rights and environmental  rights  in  the  highest-risk  countries  for  its operations  and  supply  chain.  Not  only  does  this  approach provide a better grasp of the risks in these countries, it also reveals  the  extent  to  which  the  controls  in  place  need  to  be tightened up. Furthermore, Kering plans to update its risk map so that it can incorporate other Houses and make some other adjustments.\n\n## 3.3 Regular assessments of the activities of subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## 3.3.1 Subsidiaries and Other Controlled Entities\n\nSince 2018, Kering has refocused its operations on luxury, and more particularly around the Couture & Leather Goods and the Jewelry Divisions, with 11 Houses at present.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 Stores\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  Kering's  Houses  directly  operated 1,659  stores  worldwide. As  stated  below,  Kering  published dedicated  standards  in  2020  to  achieve  its  sustainability targets that cover the commercial  life  of  its stores. These  standards  provide  specific  guidance  for  achieving environmental efficiency during both the store planning and construction as well as the store operation and management phases.  These  standards  also  provide  for  the  performance of  periodic  audits  to  ensure  that  relevant  practices  are  duly respected,  including  with  respect  to  energy  and  water  use, as well as waste collection practices.\n\nMoreover, as with all other Group premises, stores are subject to  regular  audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to ensure compliance with local regulations regarding governance, human rights and environmental protection and with  Kering's  policies  and  procedures.  As  noted  above, these  include  a  review  of  relevant  working  conditions, including  the  processes  used  to  track  working  hours  and employee  leave  as  well  as  the  measures  in  place  to  ensure that the privacy of employees is fully respected.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Offices and Other Premises\n\nOffices  and  other  premises  owned  by  Kering  and  its  Houses, including  production  sites  and  warehouses,  are  subject  to regular  audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to ensure  that  applicable  regulations  are  fully  respected  and internal  policies  and  procedures  are  fully  implemented. In  addition  to  more  generalized  testing  of  controls,  these audits  assess  the  working  conditions  of  employees  by ensuring,  for  example,  that  employment  relationships  are always formalized by dedicated agreements (in particular with respect to temporary workers) and that salaries and working hours are properly managed and documented.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.2 Suppliers and Subcontractors\n\nKering  works  with  several  thousand  suppliers  to  produce  its Houses'  collections.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Hercules supplier  database  (described  below)  comprised  a  total  of 4,745 active suppliers throughout the Group. The chart below describes the geographical breakdown of these suppliers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Hercules management system, which was first introduced in 2015  and  has  since  undergone  a  regular  series  of improvements, aims to create and share best practices in risk assessment  and  provide  supply  chain  analysis  for  Kering's production processes. This is achieved through the following tools:\n\nSupplier  Management  Procedures. The  Houses  apply  a  set of  consistent  procedures  for  managing  interactions  with suppliers, including  with  respect  to  their  qualification, assessment,  and  relationship  management.  Kering  has  also introduced a template contract that incorporates its Code of Ethics (including the Suppliers' Charter) and its Sustainability Principles.  Both  documents  are  systematically  issued  to suppliers  and  form  an  integral  part  of  the  contractual relationship with Kering. These documents further require that the commitments established therein be cascaded to relevant sub-suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nIntegrity  Due  Diligence  Procedure. Kering  subjects  third party  suppliers  and  service  providers  to  the  integrity  due diligence  process  set  forth  in  the  Group's  Anti-Corruption Policy and  Third  Party  Due  Diligence  Procedure.  More specifically,  to  properly  assess  and  manage  the  financial, regulatory, and  reputational risks associated with the relationships  with  these  third  parties,  Kering  screens  them through  the  World-Check  database  and  conducts  dedicated desktop searches. Depending on the risk profile, Kering might also  require  the  completion  of  a  dedicated  questionnaire  or the  performance  of  an  external  review  from  an  independent law firm.\n\nSocial and Safety Audits. The Group conducts regular social and  safety  audits  to  assess  and  monitor  the  Group's  supply chain operations. They are undertaken both directly and with the  support  of  third-party  firms.  These  audits  are  performed by a dedicated team, the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department, which  reports  to  the  Group's  Chief  Audit  Executive  and ensures  the  independence  and  impartiality  of  its  members. Since the inception of this tool, the Group has made regular improvements  to  the  standards  governing  these  audits. As  discussed  at  greater  length  in  the  Sustainability  chapter, the  audits  cover  social  (including  child  labor,  forced  or compulsory  labor,  and  working  conditions),  environmental, and health and safety risks pertaining to the operations of the Group's and the Houses' first level suppliers, first and second level subcontractors,  and  main  direct  suppliers  of  raw materials.  While key suppliers are audited every two years, the frequency of audits on other suppliers is determined through a dedicated  risk assessment,  together  with  anomalies identified  and  their  severity.  If  a  major  anomaly  subject  to  a 'zero  tolerance'  policy  comes  to  light  during  these  audits (including,  e.g.  forced  labor  or  undeclared  sub-contracting), Kering  refuses  to  enter  into  the  agreement  with  the  new supplier  or  terminates  the  relationship  with  the  existing supplier. In 2022,  the  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department performed 4,118 audits on these suppliers. Findings from the audits performed by the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department are discussed in dedicated committees composed of  representatives  from  key  functions  from  both  the  Group and the Houses.\n\nSupplier  Database. All  Kering's  Houses  have  access  to  a common supplier database, which includes findings from past suppliers'  audits  as  well  as  supplier  information  available from  publicly  available  databases.  At  the  end  of  2022,  this database  comprised  4,745  active  suppliers.  While  this database  does  not  yet  include  all  Group  suppliers,  it  does include  all  production  suppliers,  the  main  suppliers  of  raw materials, Kering Eyewear suppliers, and strategic suppliers.\n\nVendor  Portal. In  line  with  the  objective  of  ensuring  its Standards  are  implemented  by  its  suppliers  by  2025,  Kering designed  and  has  implemented  a  new  supplier  portal  since 2020  that  can  conduct  evaluations  and  share  information and sustainability practices. By means of dedicated questionnaires  of  up  to  around  300  questions,  this  portal assesses  implementation of the Kering Standards across the supply chain, environmental performance and social performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  this  respect,  Kering  works  in  close  synergy  with  its\n\nHouses  to  ensure  that  relevant  controls  are  adequately deployed  throughout  the  entire  Group.  Some  Houses, including Gucci, have been particularly proactive in improving their sustainability performance through the implementation of  reinforced  controls  both  internally  and  vis-\u00e0-vis  external stakeholders.\n\n## 3.4.1 Key Internal Stakeholders\n\nKering  takes  a  cross-functional  governance  approach  to upholding  human  rights  and  protecting  health,  safety  and the  environment.  Specifically,  day-to-day  human  rights  and environmental  governance  spans  various  departments  at Kering and House levels.\n\nKering  Compliance  Department . The  Group  Compliance Department  is  primarily  responsible  for  monitoring  the effective implementation of the commitments established by the Kering  Human  Rights  Policy.  As  such,  the  Group Compliance Department  is kept informed of relevant initiatives and coordinates the efforts undertaken by relevant departments at the Group and House level (including through information sharing). The Group Compliance Department also tests and assesses existing processes to map risks throughout the  Group,  and  supports  the  Houses  and  relevant  Kering departments in assessing risks associated with their day-to-day operations.  The  Compliance  departments  provide  day-to-day support in connection with the operations of each House.\n\nKering  Sustainability  Department .  The  Group  Sustainability Department is responsible for defining and implementing the Group's sustainability strategy and policies and supporting the Houses  with  respect  to  their  implementation.  The  Kering Sustainability Department  is composed  of  around  40 specialists who  report  to  the  Chief  Sustainability  and Institutional  Relations  Officer,  who  is  both  a  member  of  the Group's Executive Committee and Chairwoman of the Group's Ethics  Committee. Overall,  more  than  100  employees Groupwide  focus  on  sustainability  issues  within  the  Kering Sustainability  Department,  the  Houses'  Sustainability  teams and dedicated structures such as the Materials Innovation Lab and the Sustainable Innovation Lab .\n\nKering Human Resources Department. The Human Resources  Department  is  responsible  for  implementing controls  to  uphold  human  rights  within  the  Group.  This applies throughout the entire employee journey, including the recruitment  process  and  working  conditions,  as  well  as  in respect  of  employee  health.  A  dedicated  Inclusion  and\n\nDiversity  team  within  the  Human  Resources  function  works with the Group Houses to define and prioritize the initiatives that  foster  an  inclusive  working  environment  at  all  levels  of the  organization.  In  2020,  Inclusion  &  Diversity  Committees were created in each House and at the corporate level, led by a member  of  the  House  or  of  the  Corporate  Management Committee.  These  committees  currently  have  more  than 120 members. To embed the Inclusion and Diversity strategy more  firmly  at  regional  level,  three  Inclusion  and  Diversity managers were appointed in 2022 at the Americas, APAC and EMEA regions.\n\nKering  Internal  Audit  Department. As  discussed  at  greater length  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter,  the  Group  Internal Audit Department assesses the implementation of the Kering internal controls system within the Group's internal operations by  performing  regular  audits  in  accordance  with  the  Group's annual audit plan.\n\nKering  Security  Department. The  Security  Department's responsibilities include implementing the safety measures set out in the Kering Global Safety Policy and verifying compliance with applicable safety regulations.\n\nKering Supply Chain Audit Department. As noted above, the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department conducts regular social and  safety  audits  to  assess  and  monitor  the  Group's  supply chain operations and oversees the performance of audits with the support of third-party firms.\n\nProduct  Compliance  Department. The Kering Product Compliance Department assists the Houses to test substances in products, including through a dedicated testing center that the Group recently opened in Florence.\n\nHouse  Teams. Every  House  in  the  Group  has  dedicated Compliance,  Sustainability,  and  Human  Resources  teams responsible for ensuring that the controls established by the Kering  policies  and  procedures  described  below  are  properly deployed throughout their operations.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.2 Key Policies and Procedures\n\nKering's subsidiaries, suppliers, and  subcontractors  are required  to  strictly  abide  by  local  legislation  and  to  comply with  the  policies  and  procedures  summarized  below.  Should these  policies  and  procedures  set  forth  more  stringent standards  than  those  established  by  local  legislation,  such standards must take precedence.\n\nCode of Ethics. As  noted  above,  the  Code  of  Ethics  forms  the cornerstone  of  Kering's  ethical  commitments  and,  as  such, includes the Group's engagements in upholding human rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety and the environment. It also requires its suppliers to adhere  to  the  same commitments, notably via its annexed Suppliers' Charter, which sets out Kering's expectations vis-\u00e0-vis its suppliers. Compliance with  the  Charter  constitutes  an  essential  condition  of  any commercial relationship between the Group or the Houses and their  suppliers,  which  are  in  turn  required  to  extend  these requirements  to  their  own  suppliers  and  subcontractors. Following the 2018 update to the Code of Ethics, the document was reissued to all employees worldwide in 2019. This update reaffirmed Kering's commitment to apply all major international conventions  to  its  activities  and  to  strengthen  and  clarify  its requirements  towards  suppliers.  For  example,  the  Suppliers' Charter now includes a requirement to pay special attention to certain categories of workers, such as migrant workers, who are vulnerable to exploitation. The Code of Ethics and the Suppliers' Charter  have  been  translated  into  the  14  most  widely  spoken languages within the Group.\n\nHuman  Rights  Policy. The  Human  Rights  Policy,  published in2021,  defines  the  Group's  commitments  on  human  rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety, and environmental  protection.  The  Human  Rights  Policy  further outlines  the  Group's  policies  related  thereto  and  defines  the means by which the Group and its business partners, including suppliers and contractors, can fulfill these commitments.\n\nSustainability Principles. The Sustainability Principles, created in 2015 and updated in 2021, are applicable across all Houses and cover three main areas: social aspects regarding human rights,  environmental  aspects,  and  aspects  regarding the  sourcing  of  raw  materials  and  packaging.  Suppliers  are required to abide by these principles and supplier compliance is  evaluated  on  this  basis.  The  principles  are  outlined  in  the Sustainability chapter and on the Group's website.\n\nKering Standards for sustainable production. In the pursuit of its commitment and approach to human and environmental  concerns,  Kering  has  published  dedicated standards on raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes, and animal welfare. These Kering Standards are built around the  following  pillars:  (i)  social  impact;  (ii)  environmental impact;  (iii)  chemical  substances;  (iv)  animal  welfare,  and (v) traceability. Under its 2025 strategy, Kering is committed to seeing  that  all  its  suppliers  apply  these  standards  by  2025. A  detailed  description  of  the Kering  Standards is  provided  in the  Sustainability  chapter.  Additional  guides  on  circularity and innovation were introduced in 2022.\n\nKering  Animal  Welfare  Standards. In  May  2019,  the  Group published  the  Animal  Welfare  Standards  with  the  aim  of ensuring  the  best  treatment  for  animals  throughout  the supply  chain.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare  Standards  are  the first  ever  set  of  full  standards  for  the  luxury  and  fashion sectors and aim to drive positive change in industry practices and beyond. They cover all the species in the Group's supply chains  around  the  world,  notably  cattle  and  calves,  sheep, goats,  ostriches,  crocodiles  and  alligators  and  pythons.  For each  of  these  species,  the  open-source  Standards  highlight the  specific  challenges,  laying  down  farming,  transportation, and  slaughter  requirements,  and  provide  the  list  of  existing benchmark  certifications.  These  animal  welfare  standards were  updated  in  2021.  In  addition  to  this  multi-species document,  Kering  has  published  more  detailed  individual Standards  for  cattle,  calves,  sheep  and  goats  as  well  as guidelines for slaughterhouses.\n\nEnvironmental Policy . Kering's Environmental Policy contributes  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  Care  pillar  of  Kering's 2025 sustainability  strategy.  It  spans  the  entire  supply  chain and  focuses  on  the  three  following  objectives:  (i)  reduce Kering's  Environmental  Profit  and  Loss  account  ('EP&L')  by 40% with respect to 2015; (ii) achieve 100% alignment with the Kering  Standards  by  2025;  and  (iii)  ensure  100%  traceability for the Group's main raw materials by 2025.\n\nClimate Strategy. Kering  firmly  believes  that  companies  can play  a  decisive  role  in  the  fight  against  climate  change,  and drew up in 2021 a holistic strategy with a clear commitment to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, underlining its ambitions in sustainability, circularity  and  biodiversity.  The  key  elements  of  Kering's Climate  Strategy  include:  (i)  achieving  a  90%  absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from a 2015 baseline; (ii)  reducing  (per  unit  of  value  added) Scope  3  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  70%  by  2030; (iii) increasing direct sourcing of renewable electricity to reach 100%  in  2022  in  line  with  the  RE100  guidelines;  and (iv)  strategically  offsetting  residual  emissions  by  making  a positive  contribution  to  the  climate.  More  information  on Kering's  Climate  strategy  can  be  found  in  the  Sustainability chapter.\n\nBiodiversity  Strategy. The  Biodiversity  Strategy,  published  in 2020, explains Kering's approach on preserving natural resources. This  approach  is  structured  around  four  phases  (avoidance, reduction, restoration/regeneration and transformation) and has three  main  goals:  (i)  to  stem  the  loss  of  biodiversity,  (ii)  to re-build ecosystems and rehabilitate species, and (iii) to drive systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond. More  information  on  the  Biodiversity  Strategy  can  be  found in the Sustainability chapter.\n\nCircularity Ambition. Published in 2021, the Group's circularity  ambition  plan  aims  to  demonstrate  that  rejecting the  linear  'take  -  make  -  consume  -  throw  away'  model, involves  more  than  simply  using  recycled  materials  or designing  recyclable  products:  it  requires  real  change  in practices  at  each  stage  of  the  production  cycle.  Kering's 'Coming Full Circle' approach is built on three main elements: (i) luxury  that  lasts;  (ii)  regenerative  supply  and  clean production; and (iii) more efficient production processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  has  developed standards for stores that set out expected performance levels in  11  key  areas  (including  energy  management,  lighting, renewable energy, water use and waste treatment). The  Standards  provide  specific  guidelines  covering  the environmental  efficiency  at  all  phases  in  a  store's  lifecycle, namely  site  selection  and  relations  with  the  lessor,  design, construction or renovation, and operation. After a test phase, these standards were officially published in 2020 to serve as a reference for new stores and store renovations where the use of LEED or equivalent certifications is not possible.\n\nFashion  Models  Charter. The  Charter  on  the  Working Relations  with  Fashion  Models  and  their  Well-Being  was introduced  in  September  2017  to  ensure  that  Kering  and  its Houses  comply  with  various  major  principles,  including requiring models  to  present  valid  medical  certificates attesting to their good health, discontinuing the modeling of size 32 clothes for women and size 42 for men, and improving working conditions (e.g. providing a dedicated changing area as  well  as  food  and  drinks).  In  2019,  in  furtherance  of  this Charter, Kering and its Houses committed to only hire models aged  18  and  over  to  represent  adults  at  fashion  shows  and photo shoots as of 2020.\n\nHealth  &  Safety  Policy. Kering's  Health  &  Safety  Policy addresses  its  own  employees,  service  providers,  and  visitors to  Group  sites,  so  as  to  promote  best  practices,  assert  the Group's  commitment  to  an  environment  conducive  to employee  health  and  safety,  and  undertake  ambitious measures in this respect. This policy is founded on Group-wide best practices and aims to ensure that governance, processes, and  regular  internal  audits  are  in  place  to  achieve  Kering's target of zero accidents.\n\nCompliance  Manual. The  Compliance  Manual  was  issued Group-wide  in  2018.  It  sets  out  practical  examples  on  the main  ethics  risks associated with Kering's operations, including with respect to human rights violations. The Manual outlines the basic concepts and legal challenges involved and gives practical examples enabling employees to pinpoint areas requiring vigilance in their day-to-day work.\n\nThese  policies  and  procedures  back  up  by  the  other documents adopted by the Houses in the relevant area.\n\n## 3.4.3 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in the Internal Operations\n\nRaising Employee Awareness. Kering seeks to ensure that its employees throughout the Group are fully acquainted with its policies  and  procedures  (including  with  respect  to  human rights,  sustainability  and  environmental  protection)  through regular  training,  internal  communications,  and  Group-wide events.  The  training  offer  includes:  (i)  the  annual  Ethics  and Compliance  e-learning, with training modules  covering different ethics, compliance and sustainability-related topics, mandatory  for  all  Group  employees.  In  2022,  the  training covered inclusion, human rights, the fight against corruption and sustainability. This training also gave employees another reminder  about  Kering's  Human  Rights  Policy;  and  (ii)  the Kering Standards e-learning program, available to employees since 2019. These help employees gain a better understanding of  Kering's  strategy  to  reduce  the  environmental  and  social impacts  caused  by  its  raw  materials  and  manufacturing processes. Kering and its Houses also share their commitment towards sustainability through the company social networks, creating and communicating on Group-wide events celebrating recognized initiatives, such as the World Environment  Day  and  raising  awareness  on  environmental issues.  They  also  created Kering  Planet ,  a  dedicated  digital platform that raises awareness and provides regular information  for  employees  about  sustainability  issues.  It\n\nfeatures  interactive  tools,  such  as  quizzes  and  challenges linked to the relevant issues. Kering also raises its employees' awareness  about  the  environmental  challenges  and  has supported  The  Explorers  project  as  its  main  partner  since 2020. The project attempts to reveal the beauty and fragility of  the  planet  through  photos,  videos  and  documents  and  to take  stock  of  the  biodiversity  protection  challenges  and  the need for action.\n\nSustainability Certifications. Building on the Group's commitment  to  comply  with  the  highest  social  and environmental  standards,  a  number  of  entities  and  sites owned by Kering  and  its  Houses  have  obtained  a  significant number  of  sustainability  certifications.  These  include  the SA8000 (working conditions and social standards), ISO 14001 (environmental  performance),  ISO  45001  (health  and  safety), ISO 9001 (requirements for introducing a quality management system), ISO 28000 (security within the supply chain), and ISO 22301 (Business continuity management systems) standards. Certifications related to the implementation of environmental management systems are sought primarily for the sites  that have a more significant environmental impact, such as large logistics  centers  and  tanneries.  All  of  the  Group's  tanneries have been ISO 14001 certified since 2019.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.3.1 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Severe Impacts on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nNo Child Labor/Forced Labor. Kering and its Houses reject all forms  of  child  labor,  forced  labor,  and  human  trafficking. The Group has put into place recruitment processes designed to uphold relevant legal requirements (including with respect to  the  employment  age)  and  prevent  human  rights  abuses. To that end, employees from the Human Resources function received  special  training  to  ensure  that  such  processes  are fully implemented.\n\nPromoting Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering believes that diversity is a source of creativity and innovation and  seeks  to  develop  an  inclusive  approach  to  ensure  that everyone has the opportunity to be themselves. Kering is also committed to fostering a culture of equality at all levels of the Group  and  offering  its  employees  an  open  and  stimulating working  environment,  free  from  any  discrimination.  Kering launched the Baby Leave policy in January 2020. It entitles all employees  worldwide  to  14  weeks'  leave  on  full  pay  upon becoming  parents,  including  fathers  and  partners.  The  Baby Leave  policy  aims  to  promote  a  better  balance  between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to  achieve equality between female and male employees - regardless of their personal situations - guaranteeing all Group employees worldwide  the  same  minimum  benefits  on  a  child's  arrival. Since  2019,  the  Inclusion  and  Diversity  team  has  been instrumental  in  adopting  initiatives  to  foster  a  culture  of diversity and inclusion throughout the Group. More specifically,  this  team  has  (i)  supported  the  creation  of Inclusion  and  Diversity  Committees  in  each  House,  (ii) developed and delivered a comprehensive Inclusive Recruitment  training,  for  recruiters  from  all  Houses,  and  (iii) developed  several  initiatives  to  raise  awareness,  encourage meaningful  conversation,  and  bring  positive  change.  Such initiatives  included  the  Inspiring  Speakers'  series,  the  D&I Glossary  and  dedicated  communication  campaigns  (e.g.  the International Women's Day and Pride Month). In 2022, Kering also  arranged  inclusion  and  diversity  training  for  all  the members  of  its  Executive  Committee  during  the  Kering Perspectives seminar, illustrating the importance of leading by example  at  the  highest  level  in  this  area.  Under  its mult-generational inclusion policy, Kering signed in March  2022  its  first  inter-company  engagement  agreement covering  the  role  of  employees  aged  over  50  in  the  Group. In April 2022, it followed this up with a partnership charter on providing access to employment for young people, vulnerable adults and people living with a disability and supporting them in the labor market.\n\nEmpowering  Women. Empowering  women  is  a  priority  at Kering, which  seeks  to  ensure  that  women  are  well represented at all levels of management in the Group. In 2010, Kering  was  one  of  the  first  signatories  of  the  Women's Empowerment Principles Charter drawn up by UN Women and the  UN  Global  Compact.  Kering  and  its  Houses  develop women's skills through specific programs, such as mentoring sessions, coaching, and leadership training, to support women talents  and  enhance  gender  diversity  in  senior  management positions.  Kering  is  closely  monitoring  the  representation  of women in executive positions and is committed to achieving gender pay equity at every level of the organization by 2025.\n\nFree  from  Harassment. Kering  endeavors  to  provide  a working  environment  free  from  any  form  of  harassment  or violence.  As  such,  Kering  and  its  Houses  encourage  all employees to report any instances of such behavior, which is subject  to  disciplinary  sanctions  and,  in  many  countries, criminal  proceedings.  Kering  ensures  that  its  employees  are perfectly  aware  of  their  rights  in  this  area.  In  an  effort  to extend  its  commitment  externally,  Kering  also  supports victims of domestic violence via its 2021 Policy on Domestic Violence and the work of the Kering Foundation.\n\nIncreased  Dialogue  with  Employees. Kering  is fully committed to guaranteeing applicable trade union rights and to  engaging  in  a  constant  and  productive  dialogue  with  its employees  worldwide,  including  with  those  located  in countries  that  do  not  allow  collective  bargaining.  Kering performs  the  Kering  People  Survey,  a  biannual  employee survey  that  will  be  held  again  in  2023  to  gather  employees' feedback  on  their  working  environment  confidentially  and securely. Based on feedback received, Kering develops a Group action  plan  that  is  adapted  at  each  House  and  local  level. Kering also conducts local actions to increase awareness and foster the adoption of well-being policies.\n\nDecent Working Conditions. Kering  and  the  Houses  seek  to ensure that the work of employees is adequately remunerated and conducted in compliance with local legislation, including with  respect  to  working  hours.  As  such,  the  Group  partnered with  Fair  Wage  Network  to  conduct  a  study  to  evaluate whether the base salary of the Group's employees provides an adequate standard of living in the key countries where Kering operates.  Kering  has  also  adopted  a  number  of  initiatives designed  to  protect  the  mental  well-being  of  employees, including  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Such  initiatives include free, voluntary external psychological support services, increased  remote  working,  wellness  days  and  workshops designed to provide managers with tools to maintain cohesion and efficient teamwork despite the pandemic.\n\nSupporting Local Communities. Kering plays a role in the life of  the  communities where its sites are located and works to prevent and mitigate any negative impacts that its operations create and/or to which they contribute. In this respect, Kering is actively engaged in keeping alive artisan traditions and the communities that support artisans, including the leatherwork trade in Italy and artistic creation in Milan, Paris, and London. These  efforts  are  also  cascaded  throughout  the  Houses, as  evidenced  by  Gucci's  efforts.  In  2019,  Gucci  implemented the  Gucci  Changemakers  Program,  a  global  initiative  that allows Gucci employees worldwide to dedicate up to four paid days  of  leave  a  year  to  make  a  positive  impact  on  local communities  through  volunteering.  Gucci  also  launched  the Design  Fellowship  Program,  a  partnership  with  10  fashion schools around the world that aims to provide opportunities for  underrepresented  groups  to  gain  professional  experience and exposure to luxury  fashion  design . Kering  also  launched the  Giving  Back  program  to  meet  the  need  expressed  by employees  to  make  a  positive  difference  to  society.  The program  gives  the  employees  of  participating  Houses  the opportunity  to  support  certain  specific  local  good  causes through 21 paid working hours of volunteering per year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering is committed to the principle of risk prevention and seeks to safeguard the occupational health and safety of its employees by complying with  all  applicable  regulations  and  by  establishing  relevant best practices. The Kering Security Department is responsible for managing the security of Group sites, preparing emergency plans  and  delivering  safety  training  to  employees.  Kering, Gucci and  Bottega  Veneta  also  obtained  SA8000  and ISO  45001  certification  covering  occupational  health  and safety  management  systems.  These  tools  aim  to  reduce occupational  injuries  and  diseases  and  promote  and  protect employees' physical and mental health. Kering and the Houses have also undertaken multiple initiatives designed to protect the  health  and  safety  of  employees  during  the  pandemic, including by complying with all relevant regulations, increased remote  working,  and  offering  free  testing  for  employees  in certain locations.\n\nMinimizing Chemicals/Hazardous Substances. Kering  works constantly  to  curb  the  use  of  chemicals  and  hazardous substances  from  all  its  Houses'  products  and  production processes. For this purpose, the Group has created two lists of restricted  substances:  one  for  production  processes,  the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List ('MRSL'), and one for products, the Product Restricted Substance List ('PRSL'). The MRSL  is  focused  on  discontinuing  the  use  of  dangerous chemicals  in  manufacturing  processes  to  both  avoid  the exposure of employees to hazardous substances, and reduce toxic  discharges  into  water.  The  main  source  of  the  Group's hazardous waste production is related to the operations of its tanneries.  As  such,  the  Group  is  actively  involved  in  the research and development of environmental-friendly tanning processes,  and  has  introduced  a  heavy  metal-free  tanning method in leather tanneries.\n\n## 3.4.3.3 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Serious Environmental Damages\n\nEnvironment Profit & Loss. Since 2012, Kering has measured and  quantified  its  progress  towards  becoming  a  more sustainable  Group  through  its  EP&L.  The  EP&L  allows  the company  to  measure  its  impacts  on  natural  capital  right across  its  value  chain  and  assign  a  monetary  value  to  them. In  2022,  the  Group  received  a  Green  Finance  prize  at  the Digital  Finance  Awards  for  its  EP&L.  The  cornerstone  of  its environmental approach, the EP&L also serves as a management  tool  by  which  Kering  lays  out  its  roadmap  in terms of sourcing strategy, choice of materials, and production  and  transformation  processes.  In  2020,  Kering extended the scope of its EP&L to include the product use and end-of-life phases. The Group achieved a 50% reduction in the EP&L intensity  of  its  own  operations  and  of  its  supply  chain between  2015  and  2022.  In  line  with  its  commitment  to transparency,  the  Group's  EP&L  results  and  an  analysis  of\n\nprogress  made  are  shared  via  the  open-source  platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com . In  2022,  Kering  published its EP&L  impacts  in  euros  and  also  its  pre-monetization monitoring indicators. More specifically, it provided information including the Group's overall footprint in terms of greenhouse  gas  emissions,  land  use,  waste  production  and water use. In  addition,  one  of  the  Group's  Statutory  Auditors issued  a  limited  assurance  report  on  selected  information concerning the 2022 EP&L.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. The  Group  has  set  very ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint by 2030. As part of the Fashion Pact, Kering and over 250 global fashion brands  committed  to  take  action  to  halt  climate  change, restore  biodiversity  and  protect  the  oceans.  As  part  of  the Fashion  Pact,  Kering  and  the  other  participating  companies have  committed,  among  other  things,  to  take  action  to achieve the objective of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,  in  order  to  keep  global  warming  below  1.5\u00b0C  between now and 2100. The same objectives have been set under the Watch & Jewellery Initiative launched by the Group and Cartier in  2021.  As  part  of  these  commitments,  Kering  continues  its offsetting  program  fully  covering  for  2022  its  Scope  1,  2,  3 (calculated via the EP&L tool - excluding product use and end of life) greenhouse gas emissions released in 2021 amounting to 2,143,465 tCO2. Carbon credits have been obtained through the  provision  of  support  for  several  REDD+  (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs, with Verified Carbon Standard ('VCS') certification. Not  only  does  this  generate  carbon  credits,  it  also  provides substantial  support  for  local  populations  and  the  protection of biodiversity.\n\nFavoring  Renewable  Energies. In  2022,  Kering  reached  its RE100 objective of using 100% renewable energy, in line with the  RE100  guidelines.  Kering  also  favours  entering  into agreements  to  purchase  locally  produced  green  electricity. Where this is not possible, Kering purchases Energy Attribute Certificates. On top of external purchases, the Houses continue to increase their reliance on renewable energy, for example by installing  solar  panels.  In  May  2022,  Kering  obtained  LEED Platinum certification for its Trecate (Italy) facility, the world's largest logistics hub to have gained this certification. The hub also  boasts  Italy's  largest  photovoltaic  roof  array,  generating more energy than it uses.\n\nMonitoring Energy Use. While constantly seeking to optimize the energy efficiency of its sites, Kering has implemented an energy  consumption  monitoring  system  which  allows  the Houses to access monthly consumption data for their sites on an  IT  platform.  The  system  also  streamlines  the  energy procurement  process  by  pooling  and  consolidating  energy consumption, and increases the use of renewable energy.\n\nWaste  Treatment. Kering  and  its  Houses  have  created dedicated partnerships to find sustainable solutions for waste recycling in an effort to minimize the waste generated by the Group's operations, particularly in the retail sector. In addition, as the main source of the Group's hazardous waste production occurs  in  its  tanneries,  each  tannery  has  its  own  onsite wastewater treatment plant, which pretreats all wastewater.",

        "page_content": "More  Sustainable  Packaging. Kering  and  its  Houses  make every effort to opt for the most sustainable solutions available made  from  recycled  or  certified  biosourced  materials.  They also carry out initiatives to reduce the use of packaging while maintaining  an  optimal  level  of  protection  for  the  goods manufactured.  In  2020,  Kering  developed  a  new  packaging standard setting out the eco-design principles to improve its environmental  impact  of  packaging  materials.  In  the  same vein, Kering has pledged to eliminate single-use plastics from its  packaging  for  customers  and  business  partners  by  2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nReducing  Water  Consumption. Kering  aims  to  reduce  the consumption  of  water  in  its  operations:  68%  of  water consumed  across  the  Group  is  used  for  domestic  purposes and 32% for industrial purposes. The Group's industrial water consumption is primarily attributable to its tanneries, none of which  are  located  in  areas  experiencing  severe  water  stress. However,  the  Houses  have  continued  to  work  to  identify innovative tanning processes that eliminate heavy metals and use less water.\n\nProtecting  Biodiversity. Kering  is  committed  to  preserving biodiversity through several conservation programs. As noted above,  in  2020,  the  Group  developed  a  biodiversity  strategy, which  aims  to  stem  the  loss  of  biodiversity,  re-build ecosystems,  and  rehabilitate  species  as  well  as  to  drive systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond. As  part  of  its  commitment,  Kering  will  protect  one  million hectares of essential and irreplaceable habitats outside of its supply chain by 2025, primarily through programs that will be beneficial on  multiple  levels in terms  of  biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local people. Kering has also created the Kering Regenerative Fund for Nature to steer its action programs and achieve a net positive impact by 2025. At House level, in 2020, Gucci joined the  Lion's  Share  funds,  an  initiative  designed  to  support animal  welfare  and  conservation  projects  by  donating  a percentage  of  its  media  spend  on  advertisements  featuring animals.  Gucci  also  partnered  with  ForestaMI  to  safeguard forests in Lombardy.\n\n## 3.4.4 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in Supply Chain Operations\n\nRaising  the  Awareness  of  Suppliers. Kering  and  its  Houses provide  suppliers  with  multiple  awareness-raising  initiatives, which aim to provide tools enabling them to comply with the highest social and environmental standards. For instance, the Kering  Materials  Innovation  Lab  has  daily  interactions  with ready-to-wear and accessories suppliers to promote compliance with the Kering Standards for Raw Materials and Processes.  In  the  same  vein,  in  2019,  Gucci  organized  a number  of  meetings  with  its  suppliers  to  share  its sustainability strategy, the Kering Standards, and the flagship projects  implemented  within  its  supply  chains.  Relevant workshops  covered  Forest  Stewardship  Council  materials, animal welfare, and traceability among other issues. In 2020, Gucci  also  launched  the  Gucci  Supply  Chain  Academy,  a customized training program that focuses on the various key skills required in the supply chain function, to standardize and share  knowledge  across  all  teams  and  enable  them  to anticipate  market  trends  and  respond  to  the  commercial challenges ahead.\n\nSustainability  Certifications. Multiple  Kering  and  House suppliers have obtained third party sustainability certifications covering  environmental  and  social  standards,  among  other aspects. Kering regularly compares the standards underpinning these  certifications  with  those  laid  down  by  its  Sustainability Principles and Standards for Raw Materials and Processes so it may determine which certifications are aligned with them and those that cannot be accepted.\n\n## 3.4.4.1 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Impact on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nNo Child Labor/Forced Labor. Kering and its Houses prohibit all forms of child labor or forced labor throughout the supply chain  and  consider  them  breaches  for  which  they  have  zero tolerance, leading to an immediate termination of the supplier relationship.  As  such,  the  audits  performed  as  part  of  the Hercules  management  system  include  various  measures  to identify  potential  instances  of  child  labor  or  forced  labor.  In addition, the Kering Supply Chain Audit Department performs a  periodic  analysis  on  suppliers  to  assess  the  cost  of  their work per minute, which may lead to targeted investigations to understand  any  anomalies  identified  as  part  of  this  process (which might be an indicator of abusive work practices).\n\nPromoting Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering and its Houses expect their business partners to respect and promote equal opportunity and treatment in employment and to create an inclusive workplace.  In addition to the commitments  included  in  the  Sustainability  Principles,  the audits performed as part of the Hercules management system also  review  potential  instances  of  discriminatory  practices within  the  operations  of  suppliers.  In  collaboration  with  the Camera Nazionale della Moda and three specialized associations (BSR, Wise Growth, and Valore D), Kering and its Italian Houses issued practical recommendations on enhancing gender equality in the Italian luxury sector supply chain following an extensive study that investigated challenges  faced  by  women  in  this  supply  chain.  This  study covered  more  than  180  suppliers  and  surveyed  880  people (70% women) on gender equality via in-person interviews and questionnaires.  Four  priority  focuses  were  identified  during the study: (i) 'working conditions and economic opportunities,'  (ii)  'leadership  and  career  advancement,'  (iii) 'motherhood'  and  (iv)  'workplace  conduct  and  harassment.' Launched in 2020, the second stage of the project focused on the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  by  raising awareness of the four identified priorities. Kering also worked on  a  project  focused  on  empowering  women  around  gold mines  in  Ghana  using  tools  such  as  micro-loans  and  skills training,  and  worked  on  a  project  to  support  150  cotton farmers  in  India  through  community  education  on  women's rights, education and health and safety.\n\nFree from Harassment and Violence. Kering  and its  Houses expect  their  suppliers  to  treat  employees  with  dignity  and respect  and  to  prohibit  physical  punishment,  mental  or physical coercion or verbal abuse. As such, suppliers and subsuppliers  must  not  engage  in  any  conduct  that  is  offensive, abusive,  demeaning,  intimidating  or  threatening,  such  as verbal  abuse,  negative  stereotyping,  unwelcome  contact, unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. The Kering  Foundation  supports  women  impacted  by  violence, through partnering with survivor-centered services, and local experts, while implementing preventive programs with young people to deliver real change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIncreased  Dialogue. Kering  and  its  Houses  expect  their business partners to engage in open and constructive dialogue with  workers  and  their  representatives  and  to  respect  the right  of  workers  to  form  and  join  organizations  of  their  own choosing  and  bargain  collectively. In addition to the commitments  included  in  the  Sustainability  Principles,  the audits performed as part of the Hercules management system cover  the  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to  collective bargaining among other rights.\n\nDecent  Working  Conditions. Kering  expects  its  suppliers  to pay their employees no less than the minimum legal standard or  the  appropriate  prevailing  industry  standard,  whichever  is higher.  Kering  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  workers  in  its supply  chain  are  fairly  compensated  for  their  work.  Kering expects business partners to comply with applicable regulations regarding working hours, which should not exceed 48 hours per week.  Wages  and  working  hours  are  also  checked  during  the audits performed as part of the Hercules management system, which covers wages and working hours as well as subcontracting  and  the  risk  of  illegally  using  subcontractors that  underpay  workers.  Among  other  initiatives,  the  Group  is actively involved in the Utthan project in India, which aims to empower embroidery artisans, in particular by paying them a living wage and regulating their working hours.\n\nProtecting Against Local Community Abuses. Kering and its Houses are committed to respecting and actively contributing to  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  local communities impacted by their operations worldwide. In this respect,  Kering  undertakes  to  avoid  forced  evictions  and population displacements linked to its operations. Kering and its Houses further encourage their suppliers and sub-suppliers to  build  a  constructive  relationship  with  local  communities, and require them to source raw materials in strict accordance with the Kering Standards and the Sustainability Principles.\n\n## 3.4.4.2 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Harm to the Health and Safety of Individuals\n\nSafe and Hygienic Working Conditions. Kering and its Houses expect  their  business  partners  to  create  a  healthy  and  safe working environment through the implementation of appropriate  effective  measures  to  avoid  jeopardizing  the health  and  safety  of  workers  in  the  workplace.  For  example, suppliers are obliged to provide relevant employees with the personal protective equipment required under the applicable regulations  and  to  offer  them  training  on  relevant  safety standards  and  procedures  they  must  follow.  Employees should  also  have  free  access  to  clean  toilet  facilities  and potable  water.  The  audits  performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules management system expressly  cover  select  issues  dedicated to  the  review  of  health  and  safety  practices  within  the workplace.\n\nMinimizing  Chemicals/Hazardous  Substances. As  noted above, Kering is committed to phasing out and eliminating all hazardous  chemicals  from  its  production  processes.  The Group's  chemical  management  framework  goes  beyond regulatory requirements and includes specific guidelines, the PRSL and MRSL lists described above, that identify restricted substances within products and production processes. Kering requires all suppliers and sub-suppliers to strictly comply with this  framework and to report any non-compliance therewith. Compliance  with  these  requirements  is  also  investigated  as part  of  the  Hercules  audits  as  well  as  additional  chemical related audits targeting specific categories of suppliers at risk.\n\n## 3.4.4.3 Key Control Measures to Prevent Serious Environmental Damage\n\nEnvironment Profit & Loss. As  noted  above,  the  EP&L  is  the cornerstone  of  the  Group's  environmental  approach  and allows Kering and its Houses to measure their environmental impact  throughout  the  supply  chain.  Suppliers  and  subsuppliers are invited to share information on factors including atmospheric emissions, energy use, land use, waste production, water use and water discharge with Kering and its Houses.  The  Group  achieved  a  50%  reduction  in  the  EP&L intensity  of  its  own  operations  and  of  its  supply  chain between 2015 and 2022.\n\nSourcing  of  Raw  Materials. The  Group's  EP&L  clearly  shows that most of the environmental impact (70%) arises upstream of  its  supply  chains  as  a  result  of  the  production  of  raw materials  and  their  initial  transformation  (Tiers  3  and  4).  In 2022, Kering traced 95% of its materials back to their country of origin at least, and even further for animal-based materials (leather, and precious skins). By 2025, Kering aims to achieve 100% traceability  of  its  raw  materials  and  make  certain  that these are fully compliant with the Kering Standards so it can further  reduce  its  environmental  footprint.  Kering  further intends to increase the scope of the materials covered by the Kering Standards and scale up an internal purchasing platform to  have  access  to  high  quality,  sustainable  raw  materials following the success of the Kering Ethical Gold platform.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. The  Group  continues  to  offset greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  2022,  Kering  voluntarily  offset its full Scope 1, 2, 3  (calculated via the EP&L tool - excluding product use and end of life) greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 amounting  to  2,143,465  tCO2.  Carbon  credits  have  been obtained through the provision of support for several REDD+ programs, with VCS certification.",

        "page_content": "Waste  &  Packaging. The  transition  to  a  circular  economy, which means breaking away from the linear 'take - make - consume - throw away' model, involves more than  the  simple  use  of  recycled  materials  or  the  design  of recyclable  products:  it  requires  real  change  in  practices  at each  stage  of  the  production  cycle.  As  such,  in  2021,  Kering has  released  a  report  presenting  its  new  circular  economy goals and helped formulate the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's vision for circular fashion, published in October 2020 to unite the  sector  around  a  common  frame  of  reference  and definitions. The vision is based on three pillars: 'used more', 'made to be made again', and 'made from safe and recycled or  renewable  inputs',  on  which  Kering  and  its  Houses  are rolling out their circular economy approach. The first pillar of circular fashion is to create products that last and retain their value over time and to produce the right number of products so  as  to  avoid  unsold  products.  The  second  pillar  of  circular fashion  focuses  on  efficiently  reusing,  upcycling  or  recycling materials, products and packaging while working to strengthen  the  associated  production  channels  in  close collaboration  with  public  and  private  stakeholders.  The  third pillar  of  the  vision  for  circular  fashion  focuses  on  the  sound management of chemicals, the maximum use of recycled or renewable  materials, and  recycling at every stage of production.  As  regards  materials  used,  the  Kering  Standards allow the Group's Houses to identify sourcing preferences - recycled, bio-sourced or certified - by material. As stated above, in line with the Group's Circularity Ambition, the Kering Standards now include a section on products' end of life in order to promote a circular economy. In addition, the Materials Innovation Lab provides House design teams with a pool of sustainable and innovative materials and assists them in  the  selection of circular materials. Kering also participates in  the  Clean  by  Design  program  launched  by  the  Natural Resources  Defense  Council  to  have  the  Houses  propose  free environmental  related  audits  to  suppliers,  designed  at improving their environmental-related practices, especially at reducing  waste  and  emissions.  Finally,  the  audits  performed as  part  of  the  Hercules  management system also investigate waste  management  practice  of  suppliers,  including  recycling practices.\n\nAnimal  Welfare. Kering  requires  that  its  suppliers  capture, farm, transport, handle and slaughter animals in compliance with  applicable  local  animal  welfare,  social,  environmental and animal welfare laws and regulations. In terms of animal welfare, Kering published in 2019 its Standards for all animal\n\nspecies present in its supply chains. It also released standards specifically  covering  calves,  cattle,  sheep  and  goats,  which account  for  a  particularly  sizable  proportion  of  the  leather supply chain. Taking its commitment to animal welfare to the next  level,  Kering  decided  that  all  of  its  Houses'  collections would be fur-free starting from Fall 2022. Kering's teams and those of its Houses make numerous visits to farms and have continued  to  engage  actively  with  the  various  potential  and existing suppliers to assess and assist them in improving their sustainable  environmental,  biodiversity,  and  animal  welfare management practices. The Group also continued to roll out its  action  plan  for  verifying  the  alignment  of  the  Kering Standards  with  practices  in  its  exotic  skin  supply  chains. The assessment is carried out with specific programs for each supply  chain,  taking  into  account  the  characteristics  of  each animal species and each type of supplier. In this respect, it is worth  noting  that  the  Group  and  its  Houses  comply  with national  and  international  legislation  and  regulations  on  the trade  of  precious  skins:  all  skins  of  species  listed  as endangered or vulnerable by the Convention on International Trade  in  Endangered  Species  ('CITES')  are  obtained  with certificates attesting to their legal origin, issued by CITES and the  export  authority,  to  ensure  that  trade  does  not  threaten endangered species.\n\nProtecting  Biodiversity. As  noted  above,  as  part  of  its biodiversity  strategy,  Kering  is  committed  to  having  a  net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025. To achieve this, Kering has  agreed  to  protect  one  million  hectares  of  essential  and irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply  chain,  and facilitate  through  the  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  the transition to regenerative agricultural practices on an additional one million hectares in areas where raw materials entering  Kering's  supply  chain  are  extracted.  In  addition,  the Houses avoid sourcing materials with known negative impacts on the environment, particularly in areas of critical ecological importance. As specified in the Kering Standards, this includes ensuring that supplies are all sourced from materials that do not  cause  deforestation  as  well  as  ensuring  that  materials adhere  closely  to  the  guidelines  as  published  within  the framework of CITES. When impacts are inevitable, Kering and its Houses  strive  to  reduce  negative  impacts  on  the environment by sourcing materials from preferred sources as defined  in  the  Kering  Standards,  which  list  recommended third  party  certifications  in  our  supply  chains  guaranteeing low-impact agricultural practices, such as organic farming for instance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  whistleblowing  system  is  accessible  to  all Group employees as well as those of any service provider or external  partner  with  whom  the  Group  and/or  its  Houses maintain  contractual  relationships.  Once  the  whistleblowing system was opened up to all suppliers and service providers, these third parties have been informed accordingly.\n\nAlerts received through the Group whistleblowing system are handled  by  the  Group's  Compliance  Organization  and  Ethics Committees. Kering is fully committed to keeping the identity of  whistleblowers  and  the  information  they  provide  strictly confidential.  It  prohibits  retaliatory  action  of  any  kind  from being taken against those who blow the whistle in good faith. The  Group's  whistleblowing  procedure  is  laid  down  in  full  in the  Kering  Code  of  Ethics,  which  is  publicly  available  on  the Group's website.\n\nKering  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  all  the  information provided by whistleblowers, including about the implementation of the Duty of Care Law, should be properly addressed  and  adequate  measures  taken  to  remedy  the allegations, if they prove to be well founded.\n\nIn  2020,  Kering  undertook  an  extensive  communication campaign  notably  designed  to  remind  the  employees  of  its direct suppliers of its whistleblowing system and how to use it.  The  campaign  was  translated  into  15  languages  and  took two  forms:  (i)  a  poster  displayed  in  relevant  locations  at supplier  and  service  provider  sites,  to  gain  the  greatest visibility (cafeteria, locker rooms, site entrance, etc.) and (ii) a flyer  to  be  given  directly  to  employees.  This  campaign  has been updated in 2021 to target newly enlisted suppliers. More information  on  the  roll-out  of  this  campaign  and  its  update can be found in the Chapter 4 on Sustainability.\n\n## 3.6 Monitoring system designed to assess the effectiveness of the controls in place\n\nIn line with the cross-functional adopted by Kering to achieve a better grasp of the challenges involved in upholding human rights and protecting the environment, the Executive Committee,  together  with  other  Group-level  committees, oversees  implementation  of  the  various  measures  set  out above. These committees include the Sustainability Committee  and  the  Audit  Committee,  and  the  Chief  Audit Executive, the Chief People Officer and the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Relations Officer report to them regularly on implementation  of  existing  controls.  A  dedicated  committee also  oversees  deployment  of  the  Hercules  management system.\n\nAs  noted  above,  Kering  periodically  updates  its  risk  mapping to  constantly  review  the  controls  designed  to  mitigate  risks relevant  to  the  Duty  of  Care  Law.  In  addition,  overall implementation of the risk mapping action plan is supervised by the Group Compliance Department. This unit also conducts compliance  reviews  designed  to  ensure  that  the  Kering compliance-related  policies  and  procedures  are  properly implemented by Group entities and Houses. The Compliance Department  also  regularly  monitors  human  rights  and environmental  rights  in  the  highest-risk  countries  for  its operations and supply chain.\n\nA number of other functions at the Group level, including the Sustainability Department and the Human  Resources Department,  also  support  the  Houses  with  implementing Kering's  policies  and  strategies.  The  implementation  of  the Kering  internal  control  system  within  the  Group's  internal operations  is  assessed  at  regular  intervals  by  the  Group Internal Audit Department  through  the  internal  audits performed under the Group's annual audit plan.\n\nAs  noted  above,  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department conducts regular supply chain audits designed to evaluate the implementation of the Kering Sustainability Principles by the Group's  suppliers,  including  in  the  areas  of  human  rights, health  and  safety  and  environmental  protection.  The  most serious anomalies detected during these audits are discussed and evaluated during these committee meetings attended by the Supply Chain Audit Department and the relevant Houses to consider  what  action  to  take  concerning  the  supplier relationships. Dedicated follow-up audits, at intervals varying according to the risk profile and anomalies detected, are also arranged  to  confirm  whether  the  suppliers  have  put  an  end to these.",

The  Group  recognizes  its  obligation  as  services  are rendered by the beneficiaries, over the period from the grant date to the vesting date.\n\nAt  December  31,  2022,  only  the  plan  granted  in  2019 remained in force and exercisable, after the 2018 plan reached the  end  of  its  exercise  period  in  October  2022.  The  exercise\n\ndate is the date at which all of the specified vesting conditions have  been  satisfied,  and  as  of  which  the  beneficiaries  are entitled to ask for payment of their rights. Vested rights may be  exercised  over  a  period  of  two  years,  during  which beneficiaries can opt to cash out some or all of their KMUs in April  or  October,  at  their  discretion,  based  on  the  most recently determined value.\n\nThe  unit  value  of  the  KMUs  awarded  is  determined  and changes  based  on  movements  in  the  Kering  share  price  by itself  and  in  comparison  with  the  average  performance  of  a basket of seven stocks from the Luxury industry.\n\n## Information on grants\n\n| Year granted                              | 2018         | 2019         |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grant date                                | 01/01/2018   | 01/01/2019   |\n| Vesting period                            | 3 years      | 3 years      |\n| Exercise period                           | 2 years      | 2 years      |\n| Last exercise window                      | October 2022 | October 2023 |\n| Number of beneficiaries on the grant date | 331          | 345          |\n| Number of shares initially granted        | 64,281       | 38,205       |\n| Unit fair value at grant date  (in \u20ac)     | 581          | 753          |\n\n## Number of shares outstanding\n\n| Year granted                                            | 2018    | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021                         | 8,837   | 33,624   |\n| Number granted                                          | -       | -        |\n| Number forfeited                                        | (116)   | (4,665)  |\n| Number exercised                                        | (8,721) | (25,201) |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022                         | -       | 3,758    |\n| o/w exercisable as of December 31, 2022                 | -       | 3,758    |\n| Weighted average price per instrument exercised  (in \u20ac) | 1,231.6 | 1,346.6  |\n\n## 5.2 Plans settled in Kering shares\n\n## Free share and performance share plans\n\nSince  2020,  with  respect  to  its  long-term  incentive  plans,  Kering  has  introduced  free  share  and  performance  share  plans  for senior executives and certain Group employees.

The  performance  adjustment  ratio  used  to  calculate  the  final number  of  shares  to  be  delivered  is  determined  in  line  with Kering's  share  performance  over  the  three-year  vesting  period versus the performance of the industry as a whole, as measured based on an index of eight European luxury stocks. As well as the performance  conditions  applicable  to  all  beneficiaries,  specific performance  conditions  apply  to  the  corporate  officers,  as outlined  at  the  Annual  General  Meetings  of  June  16,  2020, April 22, 2021 and April 28, 2022.\n\n## Other free share and performance share plans\n\nKering  may  also  include  share-based  payments  in  plans specifically  introduced  for  key  executives  from  the  Houses, reflecting the creation of value at their respective brands.\n\nA  plan  of  this  type  was  set  up  in  2020  and  provides  for settlement in Kering shares after a vesting period of five years.

This  category  chiefly includes  PUMA  shares.  The  fair  value  of  non-consolidated investments  not  quoted  on  an  active  market  is  determined using internal valuation techniques drawing on non-observable inputs (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The securities in this category are not material.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  is  determined  using valuation  techniques  drawing  on  observable  market  inputs (such  as  forward  rates  and  interest  rate  curves)  and  on commonly  used  models  (level  2  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy) (see Note 19).\n\nThe fair value of other financial investments carried at fair value is determined  using  internal  valuation  techniques  drawing  on non-observable inputs (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).\n\n## NOTE 15 - INVENTORIES\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)        | Dec. 31, 2022   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Commercial inventories | 4,707           | 4,287           |\n| Industrial inventories | 1,102           | 940             |\n| Gross value            | 5,809           | 5,227           |\n| Allowances             | (1,343)         | (1,858)         |\n| Carrying amount        | 4,465           | 3,369           |\n\nIn 2022, the Group stopped using the retail method for measuring inventories.

Monetary items that are not denominated  in  the  functional  currencies  in  which  the subsidiaries operate undergo currency hedging in accordance with applicable procedures.\n\n## Analysis of sensitivity to foreign exchange risk\n\nBased on market data as of December 31, 2022, the direct impact on equity and income (excluding the tax effect) of a 10% increase or decrease in the euro exchange rate against the principal currencies to which the Group is exposed (USD, JPY and CNY) would be as follows:\n\n| Dec. 31, 2022   | Impact on equity   | Impact on equity   | Impact on income   | Impact on income   |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions) | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       |\n| USD             | 197                | (240)              | -                  | -                  |\n| JPY             | 30                 | (36)               | -                  | -                  |\n| CNY             | 131                | (159)              | -                  | -                  |\n\n| Dec. 31, 2021   | Impact on equity   | Impact on equity   | Impact on income   | Impact on income   |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions) | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       |\n| USD             | 144                | (175)              | -                  | -                  |\n| JPY             | 36                 | (43)               | -                  | -                  |\n| CNY             | 169                | (205)              | -                  | -                  |\n\nAll other market variables were assumed to remain unchanged for the purpose of the sensitivity analysis.\n\nThe  impact  on  equity  recognized  via  the  remeasurement  of financial  instruments  is  generated  by  foreign  exchange instruments eligible for cash flow hedge accounting.\n\n## 19.3 Exposure to equity risk\n\nThe  Group  has  exposure  to  equity  risk  through  its  stake  in PUMA  (3%  as  of  December  31,  2022),  the  value  of  which depends  on  fluctuations  in  the  PUMA  share  price  (see Note 14.2).\n\nThe  impact  on  financial  result  in  the  income  statement  is generated  by  foreign  exchange  instruments  not  eligible  for hedge  accounting  and  from  the  change  in  the  ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.\n\nOther  shares  held  in  connection  with  non-consolidated investments represent a low exposure risk for the Group and are not hedged.\n\nBased on market data as of December 31, 2022, a 10% change in PUMA's share price would have a \u20ac25 million impact on the value of the PUMA stake in the Group's balance sheet.\n\n## 19.4 Exposure to precious metals price risk\n\nThe  Group  may  be  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  price  of certain  precious  metals  within  the  scope  of  its  Houses' activities,  particularly  in  the  Jewelry  segment.  Hedges  may therefore  be  put  in  place  by  arranging  derivative  financial instruments to fix the production cost or by negotiating prices with refiners or manufacturers of semi-finished products.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  these  hedging  transactions  with  a residual maturity of less than one year are treated as forward\n\npurchases in  a  notional  amount  of  \u20ac38  million.  They  have  a non-material market value (notional amount of \u20ac31 million as of December 31, 2021).\n\nA  sudden  1%  increase  or  decrease  in  precious  metals  prices would have a direct impact of \u20ac0.4 million (excluding the tax effect) on  equity  via  the  remeasurement  of  financial instruments.\n\n## 19.5 Exposure to counterparty risk\n\nThe Group trades derivatives over-the-counter in compliance with its internal control procedures. The trades are carried out with top-tier companies that have signed FBF or ISDA-type agreements. The impact of counterparty risk on the fair value of derivative instruments pursuant to IFRS 13 is deemed to be zero.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These additional  benefits  take  the  form  of  defined  contribution  or defined benefit plans.\n\nUnder defined contribution plans, the Group is not obliged to make any additional payments beyond contributions already made. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred.\n\nAn actuarial valuation of defined benefit plans is carried out by  independent  experts.  These  benefits  primarily  concern mandatory  supplementary  pension  plans  in  Switzerland, statutory  dismissal  compensation  in  Italy,  and  retirement termination payments and long-service bonuses in France.\n\n## Mandatory supplementary pension plans (LPP) - Switzerland\n\nIn  Switzerland,  pension  plans  are  defined  contribution  plans that guarantee a minimum yield and provide for a fixed salary conversion  rate  on  retirement.  However,  the  pension  plans operated by the Group's entities in Switzerland offer benefits over and above those stipulated in the LPP/BVG pension law. Consequently,  a  provision  is  booked  in  respect  of  defined benefit  plans  for  the  amounts  that  exceed  LPP/BVG  pension law requirements.\n\nThese pension plans are generally operated as separate legal entities in the form of a foundation, which may be a collective institution  or  affiliated  to  a  specific  plan.  The  Board  of Trustees of these foundations, comprising an equal number of employer  and  employee  representatives,  is  responsible  for administering  the  plan  and  bears  the  investment  and longevity risks. Collective foundations insure some of their risk with an insurance company.\n\n## Statutory dismissal compensation (TFR) - Italy\n\nThe  TFR  (Trattamento  di  Fine  Rapporto)  plans  in  Italy  were created  by  Law  no.  297,  adopted  on  May  29,  1982,  and  are applicable to all workers in the private sector on termination of employment for whatever reason (resignation, termination at  the  employer's  initiative,  death,  incapacity  or  retirement). Since 2007, companies with at least 50 employees have had to transfer  their  TFR  funding  to  an  external  fund  manager.  This concerns the large majority of plans operated by Kering group companies.\n\n## Retirement termination payments and long-service bonuses - France\n\nIn France, retirement termination benefits are fixed and paid by companies to their employees on retirement. The amount paid depends on the number of years of service on retirement, and is defined in the relevant collective bargaining agreement. The payments  do  not  confer  any  vested entitlement  to  employees  until  they  reach  retirement  age. Retirement  termination  benefits  are  not  related  to  other statutory retirement benefits such as pensions paid by social security  bodies  or  top-up  pension  funds  such  as  ARRCO  and AGIRC in France, which are defined contribution plans.\n\nLong-service bonuses are not compulsory in France (there is no  legal  obligation  to  pay  these  awards  to  employees),  but hold  symbolic  value.  Nevertheless,  some  of  Kering's  French entities  choose  to  pay  long-service  bonuses  after  20,  30,  35 and 40 years of service.",

According to their management and legal counsel, no disputes currently in progress are likely to have a material impact on normal or foreseeable operations or on the planned development of the Group.\n\nThe Group believes there are no known disputes likely to have a  potential  material  impact  on  its  net  assets,  earnings  or financial position that are not adequately covered by provisions\n\nrecorded as of the end of the reporting period. No individual claim  against  the  parent  company  or  against  any  of  its subsidiaries is material to the parent company or the Group.\n\nThe  Group  is  not  aware  of  any  arbitration  proceedings  that have had in the recent past, or are likely to have in the future, a material impact on the financial position, activity or earnings of the Company or Group.\n\n## Vendor warranties\n\nProvisions recorded in respect of vendor warranties were unchanged in 2022.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nTo the best of the Group's knowledge, there are no significant contingent liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Instead,  an  entity recognizes  the  proceeds  from  selling  such  items,  and  the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 amendment  to  IFRS  3,  which  updates  references  to  the Conceptual Framework;\n- \u00b7 annual improvements to IFRSs 2018-2020.\n\nThese amendments have no impact for the Group.\n\nThe Group has also analyzed the impact of the IFRIC decision relating to IAS 38 - Intangible assets regarding the recognition of configuration and customization costs in a SaaS (Software as  a  Service)  arrangement.  An  amount  of  \u20ac21  million  net  of deferred  tax,  which  is  non-material  for  the  Group,  was recorded  in  equity  under  Other  reserves  at  January  1,  2022, with a balancing entry consisting of a decrease in intangible assets.\n\nThe Group has not applied early any standards or interpretations that were not mandatorily applicable in 2022.\n\n## 33.1.2 Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that can  affect  the  carrying  amounts  of  certain  assets  and liabilities,  income  and  expenses,  and  the  disclosures  in  the accompanying  notes.  Group  management  reviews  these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis to ensure their pertinence  with  respect  to  past  experience  and  the  current economic situation. Items in future financial statements may differ  from  current  estimates as a result of changes in these assumptions.\n\nThe impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognized during the period in which the change occurs and all affected future periods.\n\nThe main estimates made by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements concern goodwill, the useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible assets,  contingency  provisions  and  uncertain  tax  positions, inventory impairment  provisions, assumptions  used  to calculate  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities, provisions for pensions and long-term remuneration including share-based  payment,  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets and certain financial instruments.\n\nIn addition to the use of estimates, Group management uses judgment to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for  certain  transactions,  pending  the  clarification  of  certain IFRSs or where prevailing standards do not cover the issue at hand.\n\nIn  its  main  estimates  and  in  its  risk  analysis,  the  Group  has taken  into  account  the  current  macroeconomic  context, including the increase in inflation, even though the Group has little exposure  to  it.  Hyperinflation  in  certain  countries, particularly  Turkey,  has  no  material  impact  on  the  Group's consolidated financial statements. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate post-employment benefits, like the discount rates  used  in  carrying  out  impairment  tests  and  devising medium-term plans, have been assessed in view of the most recent officially published inflation figures.\n\n## 33.1.3 Climate risks\n\nIn  2022, the Group set up a Sustainable Finance department whose  role  includes  linking  the  financial  statements  with climate  issues,  responding  to  new  sustainable  finance regulations,  and  ensuring  that  environmental  issues  play  an integral part in Kering's decision-making processes, particularly as regards investments.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Kering has conducted  an  initial  assessment  of  the  financial  impact  of specific climate risks. The analysis carried out so far does not show any material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nWork has been done in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact on operational financial performance:\n- - The impact of thermal stress on the availability of certain raw materials (particularly bovine leather) and therefore on procurement costs, is not deemed material in terms of the  Group's  financial  statements.  Kering's  laboratories are  developing  new  materials  in-house,  which  should help diversify the product range and maintain the Group's revenue  and  margins.  In  addition,  various  mitigation measures,  such  as  the Kering  Standards applicable  to suppliers, or the development of regenerative agriculture practices,  will  make  the  Group  more  resilient  to  climate risks.\n- - As regards risks arising from  changing  consumer expectations, no material decline in revenue is expected.\n- - The  commitments  made  by  Kering  and  its  Houses  in terms  of  their  positive  contribution  to  climate  have already been represented in the financial statements for several  years,  and  are  an  integral  part  of  the  business model.  Kering  has  been  supporting  carbon  offsetting programs  since  2012.  In  addition,  efforts  to  reduce carbon emissions and increase the amount of electricity used  from  renewable  sources  should  have  a  positive impact on the Group's financial statements.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Impact on the measurement of assets and liabilities:\n- - As regards physical risks such as extreme events affecting the Group's facilities, no provisions for decommissioning or restoring the condition of those facilities have been set aside.\n- - The  Group  has  set  up  share-based  payment  plans including  performance  criteria  based  on  climate-related targets.  The  fulfillment  of  those  criteria  was  taken  into account in evaluating the share-based payment plans at the end of 2022.\n\nBased on this analysis, no adjustment has been made to the revenue and margin assumptions used to carry out impairment  tests.  Only  the  cost  of  carbon  offsetting, historically  allocated  to Corporate  and  other segment,  has been allocated to the trajectories of each CGU in proportion to their estimated consumption.\n\n## 33.1.4 Use of alternative performance indicators\n\nThe alternative performance indicators used by the Group and presented in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\n## Recurring operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues  and expenses  directly  related  to  its  activities,  whether  these revenues  and  expenses  are  recurring  or  arise  from  non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  consist of  items  that,  by  their  nature,  amount  or  frequency,  could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as  reflected  in  its  recurring  operating  income.  They  include changes in scope, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where  material,  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible  assets,  capital  gains  and  losses  on  disposals  of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes (see Note 6).\n\n## 33.2 Consolidation principles\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the financial  statements of the companies listed in Note 30. They include  the  financial  statements  of  companies  acquired  as from  the  acquisition  date  and  companies  sold  up  until  the date of disposal.\n\n## 33.2.1 Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which  the  Group  exercises  control.  Control  is  defined according to three criteria: power over the investee; exposure, or  rights,  to  variable  returns  from  involvement  with  the investee;  and  the  ability  to  exert  power  over  the  investee  to affect the amount of the investor's returns. This definition of control  implies  that  power  over  an  investee  can  take  many forms other than simply holding voting rights. The existence and  effect  of  potential  voting  rights  are  considered  when assessing  control,  if  the  rights  are  substantive.  Control generally implies directly or indirectly holding more than 50% of  the  voting  rights  but  can  also  exist  when  a  smaller proportion of voting rights is held.\n\n'Recurring  operating  income'  is  therefore  an  alternative performance indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This indicator is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring  performance.  It  is  presented  in  a  manner  that  is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information (see Note 2).\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe Group uses EBITDA as an alternative performance indicator to  monitor  its  operating  performance.  This  financial  indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions  on  non-current operating  assets  recognized  in  recurring  operating  income (see Note 2).\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  on  recurring  income  corresponds  to  the effective  tax  rate  excluding  tax  effects  relating  to  other  nonrecurring operating income and expenses (see Notes 6 and 8).\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Lease liabilities are not included in the calculation of this indicator. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests (see  Note  33.21).  The  cost  of  net  debt  corresponds  to  all financial  income  and  expenses  associated  with  these  items, including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings (see Note 7).\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the effective date of control.\n\nIntercompany  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  transactions between  consolidated  companies  are  eliminated.  Gains  and losses on internal transactions with controlled companies are fully eliminated.\n\n## 33.2.2 Associates\n\nAssociates  are  all  entities  in  which  the  Group  exercises  a significant  influence  over  the  entity's  management  and financial  policy,  without  exercising  control  or  joint  control. This generally implies holding 20% to 50% of the voting rights.\n\nAssociates  are  recognized  using  the  equity  method  and initially  measured  at  cost,  except  when  the  associates  were previously  controlled  by  the  Group,  in  which  case  they  are measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income  statement  as  of the date control is lost.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the  Group's  share  in  the  losses  of  an  associate  equals  or exceeds its investment in that associate, the Group no longer recognizes  its  share  of  losses,  unless  it  has  legal  or constructive  obligations  to  make  payments  on  behalf  of  the associate.\n\nGoodwill  related  to  an  associate  is  included  in  the  carrying amount  of  the  investment,  presented  separately  within 'Investments in equity-accounted companies' in the balance sheet.\n\nGains or losses on internal transactions with equity-accounted associates  are  eliminated  in  the  amount  of  the  Group's investment in these companies.\n\n## 33.2.3 Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations,  where  the  Group  acquires  control  of one  or  more  other  activities,  are  recognized  using  the acquisition method.\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  recognized  and  measured  in accordance with the provisions of the IFRS 3. Accordingly, the consideration transferred is measured at the fair value of the\n\n## 33.3 Foreign currency translation\n\n## 33.3.1 Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each  Group entity are valued using the currency of the primary economic environment  in which the entity operates (functional currency).The  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are presented in euros, which serves as its presentation currency.\n\n## 33.3.2 Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the entity's functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nMonetary items (assets and liabilities) in foreign currencies are translated  at  the  closing  exchange  rate  at  the  end  of  each reporting  period.  Any  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses resulting from this translation or from the settlement of these monetary items are recognized within other financial income and expenses in the income statement.\n\nNon-monetary items in foreign currencies valued at historical cost  are  translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at  fair  value  are  translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  date the  fair  value  is  determined.  When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a non-monetary item is recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive  income,  similar  treatment  is  applied  to  the foreign  exchange  component  of  this  gain  or  loss.  Otherwise, the component is recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe treatment of currency hedges in the form of derivatives is described in Note 33.17.\n\nassets  transferred,  equity  interests  issued  and  liabilities incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets and liabilities are generally measured at their fair value on  the  acquisition  date.  Costs  directly  attributable  to  an acquisition are recognized within other non-recurring operating expenses in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognized  to  represent  the  difference  between the  Group's  share  of  the  identified  assets  and  liabilities measured at fair value. If the difference is negative, the gain is immediately recognized in the income statement within other non-recurring operating income.\n\nThe  Group  may  choose  to  measure  any  minority  interests resulting  from  each  business  combination  at  fair  value  (full goodwill  method)  or  at  the  proportionate  share  in  the identifiable  net  assets  acquired,  which  are  also  generally measured at fair value (partial goodwill method).\n\nGoodwill is determined at the date of control over the acquired entity is obtained  and  may  not  be  adjusted  after  the measurement period. No additional goodwill is recognized on any subsequent acquisition of minority interests. Acquisitions and disposals of minority interests are recognized directly in equity attributable to the Group.\n\nThe  accounting  for  a  business  combination  must  be completed  within  12  months  of  the  acquisition  date.  This applies  to  the  measurement  of  identifiable  assets  and liabilities, consideration transferred and minority interests.\n\n## 33.3.3 Currency translation of foreign subsidiaries' financial statements\n\nThe income statements and balance sheets of Group entities with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 items recorded in the balance sheet other than equity are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period;\n- \u00b7 items  in  the  income  statement  are  translated  at  the average exchange rate for the period, corresponding to an approximate  value  for  the  rate  at  the  transaction  date  in the absence of significant fluctuations;\n- \u00b7 translation  differences  are  recognized  directly  in  equity within other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.\n\nGoodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising  from  a  business combination  with  a  foreign  activity  are  recognized  in  the functional currency of the entity acquired. They are subsequently translated into the Group's presentation currency  at  the  closing  exchange  rate,  and  any  resulting differences  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  within  other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.",

Each operating segment is monitored separately for internal reporting purposes, according to performance indicators  common  to  all  of  the  Group's  segments.  The segments  presented  are  operating  segments  or  groups  of similar operating segments.\n\nFinancial  information  provided  on  operating  segments  is prepared in accordance with the same accounting rules as in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 33.5 Revenue\n\nRevenue  mainly  comprises  sales  of  goods,  together  with income from associated  services,  and  income  from  royalties and operating licenses.\n\n## 33.5.1 Sales of goods and associated services\n\nSales  of  goods,  whether  through  a  store  network  or  online (retail activity including e-commerce) or wholesale operations, are  recognized  when  the  Group  satisfies  its  performance obligation to its clients, typically upon delivery.\n\nSales of goods are measured:\n\n- \u00b7 at the fair value of the consideration received;\n- \u00b7 excluding taxes;\n- \u00b7 net of any rebates or discounts;\n- \u00b7 net of any returned goods;\n\n## 33.6 Personnel expenses\n\nPersonnel  expenses  primarily  consist  of  wages,  salaries  and payroll  taxes,  expenses  relating  to  pensions  and  other  postemployment  benefits  under  defined  benefit  plans  (see Note  33.22),  and  expenses  related  to  share-based  payments (see Note 33.7). Wages, salaries and payroll taxes include fixed remuneration,  variable  short-term  remuneration,  long-term\n\nremuneration  plans,  expenses  related  to  employee  profitsharing and other incentive plans, and any associated payroll taxes.  Other  personnel  expenses  notably  include  severance paid to individual employees or as part of a restructuring plan, and directors' fees paid to directors of Group entities.\n\nCurrency translation adjustments in respect of foreign currency borrowings  designated  as  hedging  a  net  investment  in  a foreign  subsidiary  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  within other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. They are transferred to the income statement on the disposal of the net investment hedged.\n\nThe  performance  of  each  operating  segment  is  measured based on recurring operating income, which is the approach used by the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\nRecurring charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on  non-current  operating  assets  reflect  net  charges  to depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions  on  intangible assets,  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  property,  plant  and equipment recognized in recurring operating income.\n\nAcquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  correspond  to  gross  non-current  asset  purchases, including  cash  timing  differences,  as  presented  in  the consolidated cash statement.\n\nThe  presentation  of  revenue  by  region  is  based  on  the geographic location of clients.\n\nWhen  a  customer  (particularly in the wholesale and e-commerce businesses) has a contractual right of return or routinely  makes  returns,  a  specific  provision  is  set  aside. When  such  returns  are  not  contractual,  the  provision  for returns  is  estimated  based  on  historical  data.  Provisions  for returns are presented in the balance sheet under liabilities in respect  of  future  refunds.  An  asset  (with  an  offsetting adjustment  corresponding  to  cost  of  sales)  representing  the right to recover the goods from the client is also recognized.\n\n## 33.5.2 Royalties from operating licenses\n\nRoyalties  received  with  respect  to  operating  licenses  are recognized  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  obligations specific  to  each  agreement,  over  time  as  the  performance obligation is satisfied, for example, when calculated based on the  value  of  the  underlying  sales  generated  by  the  licensee under the agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  plans  are classified  as  either  cash-settled  plans  or  plans  settled  in Kering shares.\n\n- \u00b7 Cash-settled  plans  result  in  the  recognition  of  personnel expenses  in  the  income  statement  spread  over  the  rights vesting period and a matching liability in the balance sheet.

The  valuation  of deferred tax balances depends on the way in which the Group intends to recover or settle the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using  tax  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or substantively enacted at the closing date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are presented separately in the balance sheet within non-current assets and liabilities.\n\n## 33.9 Earnings per share\n\nEarnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income attributable to the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  period,  i.e.,  without taking  account  of  the  weighted  average  number  of  Kering treasury shares held by the Group during the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share equals net income attributable to the Group by the weighted average diluted number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect arising from free share grants.\n\n## 33.10 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is determined according to the method indicated in Note 33.2.3.\n\nGoodwill  is  allocated  as  of  the  acquisition  date  to  cashgenerating  units  (CGUs)  defined  by  the  Group.  The  CGUs  to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment\n\nplan  using  the  Black  &  Scholes  and  Monte  Carlo  models, which take into account the impacts of any market-based performance conditions as from the inception of the plan.

These  payroll  taxes  are  remeasured  at  the  end  of  each reporting  period  based  on  the  most  certain  assumptions  as regards  the  outcome  of  the  plans.  Payroll  taxes  relating  to plans  settled  in  Kering  shares  reflect  the  best  estimate  of  the number of shares to be delivered upon expiry of the plan at the end of each reporting period.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognized  on  deductible  temporary differences  and  for  tax  loss  and  credit  carry-forwards  to  the extent that their future offset is probable.\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  is  recognized  on  taxable  temporary differences  relating  to  investments  in  subsidiaries  and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal  of  the  temporary  difference,  and  it  is  probable  that the  temporary  difference  will  not  reverse  in  the  foreseeable future.\n\nUncertain  income  tax  positions  are  analyzed  and  reviewed internally  in  accordance  with  IAS  12  and  IFRIC  23  and  are shown on the balance sheet in the \"current tax liabilities\" line item.\n\nEarnings per share from continuing operations excluding nonrecurring  items  is  also  calculated  by  adjusting  net  income from continuing operations attributable to the Group for the amount of non-recurring items net of tax.

Where  that  test indicates an impairment loss, brands are tested separately.\n\nOther  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  their  useful  lives and are tested for impairment when there is an indication that an impairment loss has taken place.\n\nThe configuration and customization costs of software as part of  a SaaS ( Software as a service )  arrangement are recorded in expenses for the period.\n\nSoftware developed in-house by the Group and meeting all the relevant  criteria  is  capitalized  and  amortized  on  a  straightline basis over its useful life, which is generally between three and ten years.\n\nImpairment tests are described in Note 33.12.\n\n## 33.12 Cash-generating units and impairment tests\n\nThe  Group  tests  the  value  of  its  assets  for  impairment  by allocating them  to cash-generating units (CGUs). The impairment tests are performed each year, or whenever events or  circumstances  indicate  that  an  impairment  loss  is  likely. A CGU is the smallest group of assets, including goodwill, that generates  cash  inflows  from  continuing  use  that  are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or CGUs.\n\nCGUs as defined by the Group represent the operating segments in which the Group's brands operate (see Note 33.4).\n\nImpairment tests seek to determine whether the recoverable amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net  carrying  amount.  The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs  to  sell  and  its  value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is determined  with  respect  to  future  cash  flow  projections, taking into account the time value of money and the specific risks attributable to the CGU.\n\nFuture  cash  flow  projections  are  based  on  medium-term budgets and plans. These plans are drawn up for a period of five  years  with  the  exception  of  certain  CGUs  undergoing strategic  repositioning,  for  which  a  longer  period  may  be applied  (typically  ten  years).  To  calculate  value  in  use,  a terminal  value  equal  to  the  perpetual  capitalization  of  a normative annual cash flow is added to the estimated future\n\n## 33.13 Leases\n\n## 33.13.1 Scope of IFRS 16\n\nThe Group applies the recognition principles set out in IFRS 16 for all of its leases, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 short-term leases, with a lease term of 12 months or less as of the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, based on the value of the asset when it is new.\n\ncash flows. The perpetual growth rates are appropriate in view of  the  country  mix,  since  the  Group  now  operates  in  regions whose  markets  are  enjoying  faster-paced  growth  than  in Europe.\n\nWhen  the  CGU's  recoverable  amount  is  less  than  its  net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment is charged first to goodwill and recognized under 'Other  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses'  in  the income statement (see Note 33.1.4).\n\nImpairment  recognized  in  respect  of  brands  and  other intangible  assets  along  with  property,  plant  and  equipment may be reversed at a later date if there is an indication that the impairment loss no longer exists. Impairment recognized in respect of goodwill may not be reversed.\n\nGoodwill relating to the disposed portion of a CGU is measured on a proportionate basis, except where an alternative method is more appropriate.\n\nFor 2022, the way in which the Group took into account the inflationary  macroeconomic  situation  and  climate  risk  in  its impairment  tests  is  described  in  Notes  33.1.2  and  33.1.3 respectively.\n\n## 33.13.2 Recognition of leases under IFRS 16\n\nUnder IFRS 16, for each affected lease, the following items are recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  as  of  the  commencement date:\n\n- \u00b7 a  lease  liability,  corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  all fixed future payments for the estimated term of the lease. The  current  and  non-current  portions  of  the  liability  are presented separately. Fixed future lease payments include the  remeasurement  of  any  payments  that  depend  on  an index  or  a  growth  rate  established  in  the  lease.  They  may also include the value of any purchase options or estimated penalties  for  terminating  the  lease,  where  the  Group  is reasonably  certain  to  exercise  these  options.  In  addition, any  lease  incentives  receivable  as  of  the  commencement date are deducted from fixed payments;\n\n<!-- image -->",

an increase reflecting the discounting adjustments made over the period depending on the incremental borrowing rate  applied  to  the  lease,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to 'Interest  expense  on  lease  liabilities'  within  'Financial result' in the income statement,\n- - a reduction reflecting the lease payments made over the period,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to  'Cash  and  cash equivalents' in the balance sheet,\n- - an increase reflecting any revisions to the index or growth rate applicable to the lease payments, where appropriate, with a corresponding entry to 'Lease right-of-use assets' in the balance sheet,\n- -

a reduction reflecting the depreciation of the asset on a straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease,  with  a corresponding entry to 'Depreciation of lease right-of-use assets'  within  'Recurring  operating  income'  in  the income statement,\n- - a  reduction  reflecting  the  potential  impairment  of  lease right-of-use assets, with a corresponding entry to 'Other non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses'  in  the income statement,\n- - an increase reflecting any revisions to the index or growth rate applicable to the lease payments, where appropriate, with  a  corresponding  entry  to  'Lease  liabilities'  in  the balance sheet,\n- - an increase or a reduction reflecting the remeasurement of  future  lease  payments  further  to  a  change  in  the estimated  lease  term,  with  a  corresponding  entry  to 'Lease liabilities' in the balance sheet.\n\nThe impact of applying IFRS 16 on the income statement can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 within 'Other recurring operating income and expenses', as part of 'Recurring operating income':\n- - variable  lease  payments,  rental  charges  and  payments under  short-term  leases  or  leases  with  a  low-value underlying asset,\n- - straight-line depreciation of lease right-of-use assets;\n- \u00b7 within 'Financial result', the interest expense corresponding to the unwinding of the discount on lease liabilities.\n\nLastly,  the  impact  of  applying  IFRS  16  on  the  statement  of cash flows can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 within 'Net cash received from operating activities': variable lease payments, rental charges and payments under shortterm leases or leases with a low-value underlying asset;\n- \u00b7 within 'Net cash used in financing activities': repayments of the principal amount ('Repayment of lease liabilities') and interest  expense  on  lease  liabilities  ('Interest  paid  and equivalent').\n\n## 33.13.3 Estimation of lease terms\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period for which  a  lessee  has  the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset, adjusted for any periods covered by an extension option or an option  to  terminate  the  lease  if  the  lessee  is  reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nTo  establish  that  term,  the  Group  takes  into  account management  assumptions  (i.e.  management's  estimate  of whether  or  not  it  will  remain  in  the  premises),  the depreciation period of the underlying assets, and the amount of any investments made.\n\n## 33.13.4 Determination of the discount rate applicable to lease liabilities\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the incremental borrowing rate to all its leases.\n\nThe  incremental  borrowing  rate  corresponds  to  the  rate  of interest  that  the  Group  would  have  to  pay  to  borrow  over  a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the lease right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe rates applied by the Group are based on a combination of risk-free  interest  rate  curves  per  currency/country,  euro/ foreign  currency  swap  points,  and  the  Group's  credit  spread, also  accounting  for  the  nature  of  the  underlying  asset (property).\n\nAn  'industry'  beta,  which  varies  according  to  the  lessee's operating  segment,  is  added  to  these  inputs  to  reflect  the specific risk of each activity.\n\nThe rate curves take into account the average lease term and are prepared on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 33.13.5 Lease rights taken into account when calculating lease right-of-use assets\n\nLease rights are a separate component of right-of-use assets and  are  depreciated  over  the  term  of  the  underlying  leases, less  any  residual  value.  This  residual  value  is  tested  for impairment each year and an impairment loss is recognized where necessary.",

They are not revalued.\n\nThe various  components of property,  plant  and  equipment  are recognized  separately  when  their  estimated  useful  life  and therefore their depreciation periods are significantly different. The  cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  includes  the expenses that are directly attributable to its acquisition.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the carrying amount of the asset or recognized  as  a  separate  component,  where necessary, if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow  to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the  asset  can  be  reliably measured.\n\nDepreciation  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method, based  on  the  purchase  price  or  production  cost,  less  any residual  value,  which  is  reviewed  annually  if  considered\n\n## 33.15 Financial assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets determines  their accounting  treatment  and  basis  of  measurement.  There  are three categories of financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement (profit or loss);\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  in  equity  through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition, based on their characteristics and the management objective behind the asset's purchase. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the transaction date, which is the date the Group is committed to the  purchase  or  sale  of  the  asset.A  financial  asset  is derecognized if the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred.\n\n## 33.15.1 Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are carried at amortized cost if they are held as  part  of  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  collect contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis  category  includes  loans  and  receivables,  deposits  and guarantees,  trade  receivables  and  most  other  current  and non-current receivables.\n\nThese financial assets are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net carrying  amount  of  the  financial  asset  by  discounting  its estimated  future  cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation includes transaction costs and any premiums  and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset. Net gains  and  losses  on  loans  and  receivables  relate  to  interest income and impairment allowances.\n\nmaterial, over a period corresponding to the useful life of each asset category, i.e., 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements to land and buildings, and three to ten years for equipment.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  tested  for  impairment when an indication of impairment exists, such as a scheduled closure  of  a  store  or  site,  a  redundancy  plan  or  a  downward revision  of  market  forecasts.  When  an  asset's  recoverable amount is less  than  its  net  carrying  amount,  an  impairment loss  is  recognized.  Where  the  recoverable  amount  of  an individual  asset  cannot  be  determined  precisely,  the  Group determines  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  or  group  of CGUs to which the asset belongs.\n\nWhen an item of property,  plant  and  equipment  is  sold,  the disposal gain or loss resulting from the difference between the selling  price  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  sold  is recognized in the income statement.\n\nImpairment allowances are recognized in the income statement based on the expected loss model:\n\n- \u00b7 for  its  trade  receivables,  the  Group  applies  a  provision matrix for each country/brand based on historical loss data. Credit  insurance  that  may  be  taken  out  by  the  Group  is taken  into  account  in  the  evaluation  of  the  risk  and therefore of the provision;\n- \u00b7 for  other  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost,  an analysis is carried out taking into account the probability of counterparty default.\n\n## 33.15.2 Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income statement  mostly  comprise  financial  assets  giving  rise  to contractual  cash  flows  that  are  not  solely  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-consolidated investments and other financial investments, unless the Group has chosen to carry specific investments at fair value under the fair value option, in which case they are recognized directly in equity through other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 financial assets held by the Group for trading purposes that the Group intends to resell in the near future and that are part  of  a  portfolio  of  financial  instruments  that  are managed  together  and  for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking;\n- \u00b7 assets  designated  as  at  fair  value  under  the  fair  value option.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  these  assets  are  taken  to  the income  statement.  Net  gains  or  losses  arising  on  financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement generally correspond to interest income, dividends, changes in the  fair  value  of  the  assets  (unrealized  gains  or  losses)  and capital gains or losses on disposals (realized gains or losses).\n\n<!-- image -->",

There  are  two categories of financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  through  the income statement (profit or loss).\n\nThe  Group  determines  the  classification  of  its  financial liabilities upon initial recognition, based on their characteristics.\n\n## 33.16.1 Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  if  they  are held  as  part  of  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to disburse  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes borrowings (with the exception of put options granted to minority interests - see Note 33.21), trade payables and most other current and non-current liabilities.\n\nThese financial liabilities are initially  recognized at fair  value less  transaction  costs,  and  subsequently  at  amortized  cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## 33.15.4 Fair value hierarchy and associated valuation methods\n\nThe fair  value  of  financial  assets  is  determined  using  one  of three levels in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: financial assets quoted on an active market;\n- \u00b7 Level  2:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is  determined using  valuation  techniques  drawing  on  observable  market inputs;\n- \u00b7 Level  3:  financial  assets  whose  fair  value  is  determined using  valuation  techniques  drawing  on  non-observable inputs (inputs whose value does not result from the price of observable market transactions for the same instrument or from observable market data available as of the end of the reporting period) or inputs which are only partly observable.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and  corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  by  discounting  its estimated  future  cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation includes transaction costs and any premiums  and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability.\n\nThe  net  carrying  amount  of  financial  liabilities  measured  at amortized cost that qualify as hedged items as part of a fair value  hedging  relationship  is  adjusted  with  respect  to  the hedged risk (see Note 33.17.1).\n\n## 33.16.2 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nThe Group may elect to carry some financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement. In this case, unlike in the amortized cost method, the transaction costs associated with setting up these financial liabilities are recognized immediately  within  other  financial  income  and  expenses  in the income statement.",

In 2022, the Group  stopped  using  the  retail  method,  previously  used  for some  activities,  in  order  to  have  a  single  measurement method. The impact of this change in accounting estimates is presented in Note 15.\n\n## 33.19 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents recorded on the assets side of the balance  sheet  include  cash,  mutual  or  similar  funds,  shortterm investments and other highly liquid instruments that are readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash,  subject  to  an insignificant  risk  of  changes  in  value,  and  have  a  maximum maturity of three months as of the purchase date.\n\nThe accounting treatment of derivative instruments qualified as  hedging  instruments,  and  their  impact  on  the  income statement and balance sheet, differ depending on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- \u00b7 for cash flow and net investment hedges, gains and losses are  initially  recognized  directly  in  equity  through  other comprehensive  income.  They  are  then  transferred  to  the income statement when the hedged items are recognized. For  foreign  currency  derivatives,  the  effective  portion  is recorded in operating income, and the ineffective portion, option premiums and difference between spot and forward exchange  rates  (contango/backwardation)  are  recorded within \"Financial result\";\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges, gains and losses are recorded in the income statement in the same item as the hedged items, except for the ineffective portion, which is always recorded within \"Financial result\".\n\n## 33.17.2 Derivative instruments designated as trading instruments\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  that  the Group  cannot  or  does  not  wish  to  designate  as  hedging instruments are recognized in full in the income statement in other financial income and expenses within \"Financial result'.\n\n## 33.17.3 Embedded derivative instruments\n\nCertain financial assets or liabilities may contain a derivative instrument.  When  they  are  not  closely  related  to  the underlying  instrument,  these  embedded  derivatives  are recognized  separately  in  the  balance  sheet  as  a  derivative instrument held for trading. Any changes in their fair value are taken  in  full  in  the  income  statement  in  other  financial income and expenses within \"Financial result'.\n\nAn impairment allowance on inventories is recognized on the basis of expected inventory turnover and obsolescence and if they are damaged.\n\nInvestments  with  a  maturity  exceeding  three  months,  and blocked  or  pledged  bank  accounts,  are  excluded  from  cash and cash equivalents.\n\nBank overdrafts are presented in borrowings on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. In the statement of cash flows, cash and  cash  equivalents  at  the  opening  and  closing  of  the reporting period include bank overdrafts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  strike price of these put options may be set or determined according to a predefined calculation formula, and the options may be exercised at any time or on a specific date.\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial liability in respect of any put options  granted  to  minority  interests.  This  liability is recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  best  estimate  of  the strike  price,  with  an  offsetting  entry  in  equity  attributable  to the Group. Any subsequent changes in the liability relating to put  options  granted  to  minority  interests  are  recognized directly  in  equity,  including  the  impact  of  unwinding  the discount.\n\nThe  financial  liability  recognized  in  respect  of  put  options granted  to  minority  interests  is  shown  in  the  balance  sheet within  current  and  non-current  borrowings,  as  appropriate. Put  options  granted  to  minority  interests  are  therefore included in consolidated net debt (see Note 32.1.4).\n\nDepending  on  the  agreements  signed  by  the  Group  with minority  interests,  minority  shareholders  may  in  some  cases waive  their  dividend  rights  until  the  put  option  is  exercised. In this case, the corresponding minority interests are canceled, with  a  direct  offsetting  entry  in  equity  attributable  to  the Group.  If  the  minority  interests  retain  their  dividend  rights until  the  option  is  exercised  however,  the  minority  interests continue to be shown in the balance sheet.\n\n## 33.22 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nBased on the laws  and  practices  of  each  country,  the  Group recognizes  various  types  of  employee  benefits,  including pensions and other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nUnder defined contribution plans, the Group is not obliged to make  additional  payments  over  and  above  contributions already made to a fund, if the fund does not have sufficient assets  to  cover  the  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  personnel  during  the  current  period  and  prior periods.  Contributions  paid  into  these  plans  are  expensed  in the income statement as incurred.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nUnder defined benefit plans, obligations are valued using the projected unit credit method based on agreements in effect in each  entity.  Under  this  method,  each  period  of  service  gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is  measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation.  The obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the country where the plan is established. These plans are valued by independent actuaries on an annual basis.\n\nThis  acquisition  is  an  important  milestone  in  the  successful expansion  of  Kering  Eyewear  and  fits  perfectly  with  its development strategy.\n\nThe provision recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the  present  value  of  the  obligations  calculated  as  described above, less the fair value of the plans' financial assets under wholly funded pension plans.\n\nThe current service cost for these plans is recognized within personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement.  The  interest cost relating to the benefit obligation net of interest income on  plan  assets  under  wholly  funded  plans  is  recognized  in other financial income and expenses within 'Financial result'. Past  service  cost,  designating  the  increase  in  an  obligation following  the  introduction  of  a  new  plan  or  the  impact  of amendments to an existing plan, is expensed immediately in the  income statement within personnel expenses, regardless of whether or not the benefit entitlement has already vested or is still vesting.\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions and the impact of experience adjustments  (the  difference  between  outcomes  estimated using actuarial assumptions and actual outcomes) give rise to actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  are  recognized  directly  in equity  within  other  comprehensive  income.  These  actuarial gains and losses are never transferred to the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 33.23 Provisions\n\nProvisions for litigation, disputes and miscellaneous contingencies and  losses  are  recognized  as  soon  as  a  present  obligation arises from past events, which is likely to result in an outflow of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits,  the  amount  of which can be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions maturing in more than one year are valued at their discounted  amount,  representing  the  best  estimate  of  the expense necessary to extinguish the current obligation at the end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  discount  rate  used  reflects current assessments of the time value of money and specific risks related to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognized when there is a  formal  and  detailed  restructuring  plan  and  the  plan  has begun  to  be  implemented  or  its  main  features  have  been announced  before the end of the reporting period. Restructuring costs for which a provision is made essentially represent  employee  costs  (severance  pay,  early  retirement plans,  payment  in  lieu  of  notice,  etc.),  work  stoppages  and compensation for breaches of contract with third parties.\n\n## 33.24 Discontinued operations, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nThe  Group  applies  IFRS  5,  which  requires  the  separate recognition  and  presentation  of  assets  (or  disposal  groups) held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nNon-current assets, or groups of assets and liabilities directly associated with those assets, are considered as held for sale if it is  highly  probable  that  their  carrying  amount  will  be recovered  principally  through  a  sale  rather  than  through continuing use.  Non-current  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held for sale are measured and recognized at the lower of their net carrying amount and their fair value less the costs of disposal. These  assets  are  no  longer  depreciated  from  the  time  they\n\nqualify  as  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held  for  sale.  They  are presented on separate lines in the consolidated balance sheet, without restatement for previous periods.\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  defined  as  a  component  of  a group  that  generates  cash  flows  that  can  be  clearly distinguished  from  the  rest  of  the  Group  and  represents  a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. For all periods presented, the net income or loss from these activities is shown on a separate line of the income statement within discontinued operations and is restated in the statement of cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The retail method  technique  was abandoned  in  2022  in  order  to  retain  a  single  valuation approach.\n\nAn  inventory  impairment  loss  was  recorded  based  on  the prospects of inventory sell-through, obsolescence and damage.\n\nGiven  the  significant  amount  of  inventories  in  the  consolidated balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2022,  and  the  degree  of judgment  inherent  in  certain  assumptions  underlying  the valuation  of  inventory  depreciation,  namely  related  to  sales projections or obsolescence, we considered this topic to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the methods used to value inventory impairment following the abandonment of the retail method technique to estimate the weighted average cost;\n- \u00b7 examining the data and assumptions adopted by Management to  write  down  inventories  with  regard  to  their  aging  and future sell-through;\n- \u00b7 assessing the consistency of the impairment rates adopted in  comparison  with  other  players  in  the  Group's  business sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A report will be issued on this information by an independent third-party.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ),  prepared under the responsibility  of  the  Group  Managing  Director,  complies  with  the  single  electronic  format  defined  in  the  European  Delegated Regulation No. 2019/815 of December 17, 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single  electronic  format,  the  content  of  certain  tags  for  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  as  to  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed statutory auditors of Kering S.A. by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 1994 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s, and of April 28, 2022 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s was in its 29 th year of uninterrupted engagement and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit in its 1 st year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  by  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\nIdentifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\nObtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n\nEvaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n\nAssesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n\nEvaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n\nObtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the  direction, supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration  referred  to  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  Number  537/2014, confirming our independence pursuant to the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors.  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris La D\u00e9fense, March 3, 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nCamille Phelizon\n\nPatrice Morot\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Margerin\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation  and  amortization  are  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method  based  on  the  nature  and  useful  life  of  each component.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment and intangible assets are depreciated using the straight-line method and the following useful lives:\n\n| Software                                     | 1 to 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Internally generated software                | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Improvements to property                     | 10 to 24 years |\n| Technical installations, tools and equipment | 10 to 15 years |\n| Computer equipment                           | 1 to 10 years  |\n| Office furniture                             | 10 years       |\n\n## 2.2 Long-term investments\n\n## Investments\n\nSecurities classified as 'Investments' are those considered necessary for the Company's activities, particularly because  they  provide  the  Company  with  influence  over,  or control of, the issuer.\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  acquisition  expenses  in  the  cost price of investments, in accordance with the standard method under French generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  gross  value of investments is compared to their recoverable value for the Company,  determined  with  reference  to  the  subsidiary's estimated economic value and taking into consideration the purpose  of  the  original  transaction.  Recoverable  value  is determined  using  a  multi-criteria  approach  based  on  future cash  flow  projections,  the  revised  asset  value,  the  share  of consolidated  or  revalued  shareholders'  equity,  and  other methods.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## Other long-term investments\n\nOther long-term investments include other investments and certain treasury shares.\n\n## Other investments (excluding treasury shares)\n\nOther  investments  are  investments  that  the  Company  plans or  is  required  to  hold  on  a  long-term  basis,  but  which  are not deemed necessary for the Company's activities.\n\nThe  gross  amount  of  these  investments  is  equal  to the acquisition cost plus any related acquisition fees.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized based on the value in use of these securities to the Company.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares acquired under liquidity agreements are  recorded  under  'Other  long-term  investments\".  These shares  are  written  down  where  necessary  to  reflect  the average share price over the last month of the fiscal year.\n\nTreasury shares acquired for the express purpose  of being  used  in  a  future  capital  reduction  are  also  classified under  'Other  long-term  investments\".  These  shares  are  not written down to reflect the share price.\n\n## 2.3 Receivables\n\nReceivables  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  nominal  value  and  are  written  down  where  they  present  a  risk of non-recovery.\n\n## 2.4 Marketable securities and negotiable debt securities\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares acquired for the express purpose  of being subsequently granted to employees under stock option plans and free share plans are recorded under 'Marketable  securities\".No  impairment  is  recognized  on treasury shares to reflect the share price.\n\n## Other shares\n\nShares are recorded at their acquisition cost. An impairment  loss  is  recognized  when  their  closing  price  falls below their carrying amount.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accrued interest as of the acquisition date and as of the end of the reporting period is recorded in an accrued interest account.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  cost  of  the  bonds is  compared  to  the  market  value  of  the  principal  over  the last  month  of  the  year,  excluding  accrued  interest.  An impairment loss  is  recorded  when  this  value  falls  below  the gross value.\n\n## 2.5 Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome  and  expenses  denominated  in  foreign currencies are recorded at their euro-equivalent value on the transaction date. Borrowings,  receivables  and  liquidity  positions  denominated  in foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the  closing  exchange  rate.  In the  case  of  foreign  currency  hedging,  borrowings  and  receivables are translated at the hedging rate.\n\n## Mutual funds (Sicav)\n\nShares  in  mutual  funds  are  recorded  at  their  acquisition cost  excluding  subscription  fees,  and  their  net  asset  value is estimated as of the end of the reporting period. A provision for  impairment  is  recorded  in  respect  of  any  unrealized capital losses. No unrealized capital gains are recognized.\n\n## Negotiable certificates of deposit, certificates of deposit and notes issued by financing companies\n\nNegotiable debt securities are subscribed on the primary  market  or  purchased  on  the  secondary  market.They are  recorded  at  acquisition  cost  less  accrued  interest  as  of the  acquisition  date  when  purchased  on  the  secondary market.\n\nPrepaid  interest  is  recognized  as  financial  income  on a proportional basis for the fiscal year.\n\nAny  translation  differences  resulting  from  the  valuation of foreign currency borrowings and receivables are recorded in accrual  accounts,  as  an  asset  for  unrealized  losses  and  as a liability for unrealized  gains.  A  contingency  provision is recorded to cover any unhedged  unrealized  losses. Where borrowings and receivables are hedged by financial  instruments,  any  foreign  currency  gains  or  losses are recorded in the income statement when the hedged item is settled.\n\n## 2.6 Bond issue and capital increase fees - Bond redemption premiums\n\nBond issue fees are recognized as of the issue date.\n\nCosts associated with increases in capital, mergers or restructuring are charged against the additional paid-in capital arising from the merger or restructuring.\n\nBonds are recorded at their par value.\n\n## 2.7 Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized in accordance with CNC regulation  no.  2000.06  and  include  pension  and  other employee benefit obligations pursuant to ANC recommendation no. 2013-02.\n\nUnder  defined  benefit  plans,  obligations  are  valued  using the  projected  unit  credit  method  based  on  agreements  in effect  in  the  Company.  Under  this  method,  each  period  of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and  each  unit  is  measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final obligation.  The  obligation  is  then  discounted.  The  actuarial\n\n## 2.8 Tax consolidation\n\nKering  has  set  up  a  tax  consolidation  group  in  France with several sub-groups and subsidiaries.\n\nEach  subsidiary  recognizes  a  tax  expense  for  the  amount of  tax  it  would  have  paid  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  The  tax\n\nAny issue or redemption premiums are assigned to the relevant balance sheet item and amortized over the term of the bond.\n\nFor convertible bonds, the redemption premium is recognized over the term of the bond.\n\nassumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending on economic conditions.\n\nThese benefit obligations are assessed by independent actuaries on an annual basis. The valuations take into  account  the  level  of  future  compensation,  the  probable active life of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nKering applies CRC notice no. 2008-17 of November 6, 2008, on  the  accounting  treatment  of  stock  option  and  employee free share plans.\n\nsavings generated by the Group as a result of tax consolidation are  retained  by  Kering  SA  as  the  parent  company  of  the tax consolidation group.",

The  latest agreement  was  signed  on  February  13,  2019,  in  accordance with  AMF  ruling  no.  2018-01  of  July  2,  2018,  applicable since January 1, 2019. An amendment to that agreement came into  force  on  July  1,  2021,  providing  for  the  resources  in the liquidity account to be reduced by \u20ac25 million.As a result, there has been \u20ac25 million in the liquidity account since July 1, 2021.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  and  December  31,  2021,  Kering held no shares in treasury under the liquidity agreement.\n\n## Share Buyback Program\n\nPursuant to the Share Buyback Program announced on August 25, 2021, covering up to 2.0% of Kering's share capital over a 24-month  period,  the  Group  signed  a  new  stock  repurchase agreement with an investment service provider.\n\nTo recap, the first tranche of this share buyback program was completed  on  November  3,  2021.  Between  August  25  and November  3,  2021,  650,000  shares  were  repurchased  at  an\n\naverage price of \u20ac643.70 per share, representing around 0.5% of the share capital. 325,000 shares of that first tranche were canceled on December 10, 2021, pursuant to a decision by the Board of Directors at its meeting on December 9, 2021.\n\nThe second tranche of the share buyback program was then completed on April 6, 2022. Between February 23 and April 6, 2022, 650,000 shares were repurchased at an average price of \u20ac578.71  per  share,  representing  around  0.5%  of  the  share capital. The Board of Directors decided in its meeting of April 28, 2022, to cancel 325,000 shares by the end of 2022.\n\nThe  third  tranche  of  the  program,  covering  a  maximum volume of 650,000 shares, i.e. approximately 0.5% of Kering's share  capital,  was  carried  out  between  May  18  and  July  19, 2022. The maximum price per share was set at \u20ac1,000 by the fifteenth resolution adopted in the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022.\n\nThe Share Buyback Program was completed on December 15, 2022. Between August 25, 2021, and December 15, 2022, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares. Of those, 1,050,000 shares have already been canceled.\n\nThe total purchase price of the canceled shares was \u20ac382,293,989.24, which was allocated to the following accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,900,000 to 'share capital';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac184,630,756.69 of the surplus over par value paid for the canceled shares to 'additional paid-in capital';\n- \u00b7 \u20ac194,763,232.55 of the surplus over par value paid for the canceled shares to 'additional paid-in capital'\n\n## NOTE 4 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nMovements in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are presented below:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)               |   Gross | Depreciation, amortization and impairment   |   Dec. 31, 2022, Net |   Dec. 31, 2021, Net |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Intangible assets             |     499 | (147)                                       |                  352 |                  332 |\n| Property, plant and equipment |      48 | (19)                                        |                   29 |                   31 |\n\n## Changes in non-current assets\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                |   Carrying amount as of January 1 |   Acquisitions | Disposals / retirements   | Depreciation and  amortization   |   Reversals of depreciation and amortization |   Carrying amount as of December 31 |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets              |                               332 |            113 | (40)                      | (63)                             |                                            9 |                                 352 |\n| Property, plant  and equipment |                                31 |              3 | (1)                       | (4)                              |                                            1 |                                  29 |\n| TOTAL                          |                               363 |            116 | (41)                      | (67)                             |                                           10 |                                 381 |",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1, of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.  823-9  and  R.  823-7  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L.  822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  in  the  French  Code of Ethics for statutory auditors.

This  program specifies  a  maximum  purchase  price  of  \u20ac700  per  share  and states that the number of shares purchased may not exceed 10% of the share capital. Subsequently, the General Meeting of July  6,  2021,  in  its  only  resolution,  increased  the  maximum purchase price to \u20ac1,000 per share in view of the continuous rise in the Company's share price and the fact that in May 2021 it rose  above  the  maximum  purchase  price  set  in  the April 22, 2021 AGM.\n\nThe authorization given to the Board of Directors to trade in Company shares for a period of 18 months was renewed at the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 under the fifteenth resolution (maximum purchase price of \u20ac1,000 per share).\n\n## Liquidity agreement\n\nSince May 26, 2004, Kering has maintained agreements with a financial intermediary in order to improve the liquidity of the Group's  shares  and  ensure  share  price  stability.  The  latest agreement  was  signed  on  February  13,  2019,  in  accordance with  AMF  ruling  no.  2018-01  of  July  2,  2018,  applicable since January 1, 2019. An amendment to that agreement came into  force  on  July  1,  2021,  providing  for  the  resources  in  the liquidity  account  to  be  reduced  by  \u20ac25  million.  As  a  result, there was \u20ac25 million in the liquidity account on July 1, 2021.\n\nDuring 2022, Kering purchased 191,105 shares for an amount of  \u20ac101.2  million,  representing  an  average  price  of  \u20ac529.40  per share. Similarly, Kering sold 191,105 shares for an amount of \u20ac101.2 million, representing an average price of \u20ac529.72 per share. From January 1, 2023 to February 14, 2023, the Company purchased 25,393 shares at an average price of \u20ac546.36 per share and sold 24,893 shares at an average price of \u20ac547.01 per share under the liquidity agreement.\n\nThe  objectives  that  could  be  pursued  are  defined  in  the corresponding resolution and include canceling shares, allotting shares  to  the  Company's  employees  or  corporate  officers within the scope of free share or stock purchase option plans, ensuring liquidity and maintaining the Company's share price under  a  liquidity  agreement,  retaining  shares  and,  where applicable, selling, transferring or exchanging them in external growth transactions.",

The Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 authorized the Board of Directors to carry out capital increases reserved for  eligible  Group  employees  and  corporate  officers and  free  awards  of  shares  to  employees  and  executive corporate officers.\n\nOn  July  7,  2022,  as  part  of  its  KeringForYou  employee  share ownership program and under the authorizations granted by the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 in its seventeenth and eighteenth resolutions, the Company carried out a capital increase  reserved  for  employees  by  issuing  102,862  ordinary shares  with  par  value  of  \u20ac4  each  (total  nominal  value  of \u20ac411,448), increasing the share capital to \u20ac499,183,112 euros, divided into 124,795,778 shares with par value of \u20ac4 each.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  authorization  granted  at  the  Annual General Meeting of April 22, 2021 in the fifteenth resolution, on December 12, 2022 the Group Managing Director, acting by delegation of authority from the Company's Board of Directors, reduced the share capital by \u20ac2,900,000 through the cancellation of  725,000  treasury  shares  resulting  from  the  second  and third  tranches  of  the  share  buyback  program  that  began  on August  15,  2021,  This  operation  reduced  the  overall  share capital to \u20ac496,283,112, divided into 124,070,778 shares with a par value of \u20ac4 each.\n\nIn  addition,  as  part  of  free  performance  share  plans  set  up since  2020  within  the  Group,  and  under  the  authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of April 28, 2022 in its sixteenth  resolution,  on  October  4,  2022  Kering  awarded 74,274 performance shares to managers and certain employees of the Group.\n\nThe other authorizations were not used during the year.\n\n## 1.4 Employee share ownership\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Company and Group employees and executive corporate officers held 236,934 shares, representing 0.2%  of  the  share  capital,  under  the  provisions  of  Article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code. This includes the 11,695  Company  shares  held  by  employees  through  the employee investment fund and the 99,691 shares owned by employees as part of the KeringForYou program. This employee\n\nshare  ownership  program,  implemented  for  the  first  time in  2022,  gives  eligible  employees  in  several  countries  the opportunity  to  become  Kering  shareholders  on  preferential terms and thus have a direct interest in its development and future  performance  (see  Note  5.3  'Capital  increase  reserved for employees' to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Other securities giving access to the share capital\n\n## Special report on stock subscription and purchase options and free share grants\n\nA  free  share  plan  was  put  in  place  on  October  4,  2022 (see section 1.3 of the present chapter and Note 5.2 'Plans settled in Kering shares' to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Stock option plans\n\nNo  stock  subscription  and  purchase  option  plans  have  been set  up  since  2007.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  there  were  no stock subscription or purchase options outstanding.\n\n## Changes in share capital and rights attached to shares\n\nAny  changes  in  the  share  capital  or  the  rights  attached  to shares  are  governed  by  legal  requirements  and  the  specific provisions of the Articles of Association as set out below.\n\nUnder Article 15 of the Articles of Association, in the Company's internal organization, decisions by the Chief Executive Officer and, where applicable, the Group Managing Director relating to the issue of securities, regardless of their nature, require the prior approval of the Board of Directors when such issues are likely to change the share capital.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its actions  are  targeted  and  customized  to  offer  different audiences - private individual shareholders and the financial community - messages suited to their respective expectations while complying with the principle of equal access to information.\n\n## Toward individual shareholders\n\nPrivate individual shareholders have access to various media and tools to keep themselves informed about the Group and events affecting its shares. These include the twice-yearly Letter to Shareholders, the Shareholders' Guide (available online, in French only), the shareholders' hotline (+33 (0)1 45 64 65 64) and email address (actionnaire@kering.com), financial notices in  the  press  and  online,  the  Group's  website,  and  the  annual report.\n\n## Toward the financial community\n\nThe Group maintains close relationships with the French and international financial community. A number of initiatives are designed to keep the financial community informed about its businesses,  strategy  and  outlook.  Kering  has  expanded  its communication  by  organizing  conference  calls  upon  the release of quarterly revenue, half-year and annual results, as well as participating in industry conferences held by major banks. All  of  the  presentation  material  is  available  on  the  Group's website.  Kering  also  meets  with  investors  during  roadshows held in the major financial centers around the world.\n\nIn addition, at the initiative of its Board of Directors, the Company continued  to  strengthen  dialogue  with  investors,  particularly on  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  issues.  With this in mind, in November 2022 the Lead Independent Director,\n\nwith  the  participation  of  the  Board  Secretary,  the  Chief Sustainability  Officer,  the  Chief  People  Officer,  the  Financial Communications  Department  as  well  as  the  Chief  Financial Officer, organized a roadshow dedicated to ESG matters, meeting with  a  number  of  investors  (representing  nearly  40%  of  the free float).\n\nThe  presentation  used  at  the  roadshow  is  available  on  the Kering website.\n\nThe  Group  meets  with  investors  and  analysts  upon  request and maintains proactive relationships in terms of reporting to the French Financial Market Authority (AMF).\n\n## Procedures for communicating regulatory information\n\nPursuant to obligations - applicable since January 20, 2007 to disclose regulatory information resulting from the implementation  of  the  Transparency  Directive  in  the  AMF's General Regulations, Kering's Financial Communications Department  oversees  the  proper  and  full  disclosure  of regulatory information. This information is filed with the AMF at the time of its disclosure and stored on the Kering website.\n\nFull and effective communication is carried out electronically in  compliance with the criteria defined by the AMF's General Regulations, which require communication to a wide audience within the European Union and under conditions guaranteeing the security of the communication and information. Accordingly, Kering's Financial Communications Department has chosen to work  with  a  professional  communications  agency  satisfying the communication criteria set by EU Regulation No. 596/2014 on  market  abuse  and  the  AMF's  General  Regulations.  The communications agency is included on the list published by the  AMF,  thus  benefiting  from  a  presumption  of  full  and effective communication.\n\n## 2023 shareholders' agenda\n\n| April 25, 2023 (after market close)   | First-quarter revenue   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| April 27, 2023                        | Annual General Meeting  |\n| July 27, 2023                         | First-half results      |\n| October 2023 (1)                      | Third-quarter revenue   |\n\n- (1) The specific date will be posted on kering.com.\n\n- 438",

All  shareholders  may  vote  by correspondence  using  a  form  filled  out  and  sent  to  the Company under the conditions laid down by the regulations in force,  including  electronically,  pursuant  to  a  decision  by  the Board  of  Directors.  This  form  must  reach  the  Company  in accordance with the regulatory conditions in order to be taken into  account.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  reduce  said timeframe  for  the  benefit  of  all  shareholders.  Owners  of securities  who  are  not  resident  on  French  territory  may  be represented by an intermediary who  is  registered in accordance with the conditions laid down by the regulations in force.\n\nMeetings  are  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or, in his/her absence, by the member of the Board who  is  specifically  appointed  for  this  purpose  by  the  Board. Failing this, the meeting elects its own chair.\n\nMeeting minutes are prepared and copies thereof are certified and issued in accordance with the law.\n\nIn all Annual General Meetings, a voting right that is double the right  conferred  on  the  other  shares  is  granted  to  all  shares that are fully paid up and for which proof is provided that they have been held in registered form for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder. This double voting right, which existed in the Articles of Association of Pinault SA prior to its merger with Printemps SA, was restated at  the  time  of  their 1992 merger.\n\nThis  double  voting  right  may  be  withdrawn  outright  at  any time  pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the  Extraordinary  General Meeting  and  after  ratification  by  a  special  meeting  of  the beneficiary shareholders.\n\n(Article 19 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe  double  voting  right  existed  at  both  Pinault  SA  and Printemps  SA  prior  to  their  1992  merger.  The  Company's\n\nArticles  of  Association  do  not  provide  that,  in  the  event  of  a free allocation of registered shares to a shareholder in respect of  old  shares  for  which  he/she/it  had  a  double  voting  right, the  new shares are also entitled to a double voting right.\n\nPursuant to the relevant  legislation,  double  voting  rights  are canceled for any share converted to a bearer share or in the event  of  a  transfer  of  ownership  except  in  the  case  of  a transfer  following  inheritance,  liquidation  of  joint  property between spouses, or donation between living family members (spouse or relative) with legal inheritance rights.\n\nVoting rights are not limited under the Articles of Association.\n\n## Provisions of the Articles of Association relating to shareholder notifications\n\nThe  shares  shall  be  in  registered  or  bearer  form  at  the shareholder's discretion. The shares shall be entered into an account  under  the  conditions  and  in  accordance  with  the terms provided for by the regulations in force.\n\nThe  Company is  authorized  to  use  the  provisions  of  the  law and  regulations  regarding  the  identification  of  the  holders of securities that grant immediate or deferred access to voting rights at its own Annual General Meetings.\n\nIn addition to the legal obligations to notify the Company and the French financial markets authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers  -  AMF)  when  shareholdings  reach  or  fall  below  a given  threshold,  any  individual  or  legal  entity  directly  or indirectly  holding  shares  in  the  Company,  whether  acting alone  or  in  concert,  shall  notify  the  Company  of  the  total number  of  shares  and  voting  rights  held  if  said  number reaches  or  exceeds  2%  or  any  multiple  thereof,  including multiples  exceeding  the  legal  threshold  of  5%.  Notifications shall be made by registered letter with return receipt sent to the  registered  office  no  later  than  15  days  after  the  date  on which the threshold was crossed or reached, or by any other equivalent  means  for  shareholders  not  residing  in  France, it  being  specified  that  the  contents  of  the  notification  must comply  with  the  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  applicable to  shareholder  notifications  concerning  legal  thresholds, and  must  include  the  information  to  be  provided  in  such circumstances to the AMF, as stated in its General Regulations. The same notification obligation shall apply under the same conditions  when  a  shareholder's  total  shares  and/or  voting rights  reach  or  fall  below  any  of  the  aforementioned thresholds.\n\nIf  the  notification is not submitted, the shares exceeding the threshold for which the notification should have been made may be deprived of voting rights at the request of one or more shareholders  holding  a  combined  or  individual  total  of  at least 5% of the Company's share capital and/or voting rights, under the conditions set forth in the sixth paragraph of Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code. If the notification is subsequently made, the corresponding voting rights may not be  exercised  until  the  period  of  time  defined  by  law  or  the prevailing regulations has expired.\n\n(Article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThere are no shares not representing capital.\n\nThe  steps  required  to  amend  shareholder  rights  are  those provided for by law.\n\n<!-- image -->",
