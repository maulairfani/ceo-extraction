They are the secret to our company's success. Their determination to go that extra mile and their spirit of solidarity were, once again, exemplary. They have my utmost admiration.\n\nNicolas Hieronimus' inspiring leadership was of course crucial in guiding teams and unlocking the impressive growth momentum in our sales, market shares and results. He and the Executive Committee succeeded in swi/f\\_tly rising to challenges while seizing every opportunity in an ever-changing market. The complementarity of our roles as Chairman and CEO is crucial in pursuing L'Or\u00e9al's ambitious and harmonious development.\n\nI know our people are utterly committed to fighting for a more sustainable planet and a more caring world. As Chairman, I will always ensure L'Or\u00e9al continues to embody and inspire change with perseverance, ambition and sincerity.\n\nDual financial and social excellence will always be at the heart of our business model.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank and congratulate our CEO, the members of the Executive Committee and all our employees around the world for their remarkable achievements.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's highly demanding governance is also one of its fundamental assets. With their wide-ranging expertise and fruitful exchanges, our directors foster a long-term vision and set a clear course for the Group. This year, the Board focused on strategies in Research & Innovation, Beauty Tech and Green Sciences, as well as our corporate social and environmental responsibility.\n\nAnother key asset is the loyalty of our shareholders, with whom the Group has a very close relationship. In this respect, 2022 was a year to remember in terms of The many awards received by L'Or\u00e9al for the quality of its financial communications.\n\nFinally, our founding principles never waver. They give us the stability to weather any storm. Underpinned by entrepreneurial spirit, boldness, imagination and ethics, L'Or\u00e9al is full of resources, thrives on its diversity and is concerned about the world we live in.\n\nAll of these assets fill me with immense confidence inthe future.\n\nWe are perfectly prepared to create the best of beauty. Our market is solid, our value creation model is balanced and virtuous. Our governance is robust and vigilant. Our teams are talented and determined. Our brands are strong and inclusive. Innovation is in our DNA and greatly augmented by our Beauty Tech and digital edge.\n\nMore than ever, L'Or\u00e9al is driven by tremendous energy .",

        "page_content": "## PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Sense of Purpose ) is a core principle for the Group, to see ourselves as a high-performing, committed, responsible,  inclusive  company  showing  solidarity  in  decades to  come.  L'Or\u00e9al's  raison  d'\u00eatre  is  included  in  the  strategies defined by its Board of Directors and its business model. (raison d'\u00eatre\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose was developed following the work implemented  over  almost  two  years,  initiated  and  driven  at the  highest  level  by  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  and  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus,  as  well  as  several  members  of  the  Executive Committee. was the result of dialogues with  the  Group's  employees  in  three  of  its  key  countries (France,  the  United  States  and  China)  and  many  external stakeholders, including consumers. The progress made was  discussed  several  times  in  the  Executive  Committee. For L'Or\u00e9al,  the  aim  was  to  collect  and  formalise  its contribution  to  the  world  as  a  company,  its  values  and  its commitments in one document. L'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre\n\nThis raison  d'\u00eatre was  approved  on  6  February  2020  by  the Board of Directors, who incorporated it into their Management Report published in the 2019 Universal Registration Document and presented to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 30 June 2020.\n\nIn  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  received  the  Award  for  ESG  Purpose  and Commitments  at  the  2022  General  Meeting  and  Gender Balance  Awards  ceremony,  organised  by  the  Institut  du Capitalisme Responsable.\n\nA  single  sentence  epitomises  L'Or\u00e9al's  Sense  of  Purpose: 'Create  the  beauty  that  moves  the  world.' It  is  defined  in concrete  actions made  to  consumers,  employees,  clients, suppliers,  shareholders,  service  providers  and  communities. L'Or\u00e9al is committed  to  fighting  climate  change,  by respecting  biodiversity  and  preserving  natural  resources,  and to  championing  the  cause  of  women.  The  majority  of  the\n\nGroup's  brands  have  supported  their  cause  since  2018, in fields such as combating violence against women with the 'Abuse  is  Not  Love'  programme  from  Yves  Saint  Laurent Beauty,  with  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  backing  the  Stand  Up  campaign against street  harassment and Lanc\u00f4me helping women get access to reading with the Write her Future programme or in the environmental  field with Biotherm's (1) Water  Lovers programme .\n\nIn its  Management Report, dislosed in the present document, L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors reports on the implementation of the  commitments  included  in  its raison  d'\u00eatre ,  and  on  the progress towards the goals set:\n\n- \u25cf economic  performance  is  inseparable  from  corporate social responsibility performance. The results of the Group's non-financial performance, which are reviewed by external auditors  along  with  its  financial  performance,  reflect  the achievements of L'Or\u00e9al  arising  from  its  sense  of  purpose. Chapter 4 reports on the social, environmental and societal policies  and  progress,  inclusion  and  ethics  within  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  covering  the  Group's commitments to sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  also  presents  its  progress  and  achievements  in non-financial  areas  through  its  annual  reporting  made  to the United Nations Global Compact;\n- \u25cf this chapter also reports on the Group's financial performance, particularly through its business model (see section 1.2.); and\n- \u25cf the  Group's  CSR  performance  is  one  of  the  factors considered  in  determining  the  variable  portion  of  the remuneration  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  executive  corporate  officers (see section 2.4.) and the Group's principal executives (see section 4.1.).\n\n## 1.1.2. The strategy and fundamentals of L'Or\u00e9al\n\n## 1. A clear vision and strategy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has defined a clear vision that is broken down into two points:  its  Sense  of  Purpose which  is  detailed above, and Beauty for All. L'Or\u00e9al aims to offer women and men around the world the best in cosmetics in terms of quality, effectiveness,  safety,  sincerity  and  responsibility  in  order  to meet all their needs and all their beauty wishes in their infinite diversity.  More  than  ever,  L'Or\u00e9al's  vision  takes  on  its  full meaning  and  represents  a  strong  anchor  in  this  increasingly unpredictable and complex environment. (raison  d'\u00eatre) ,\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's strategy is Glocalisation, meaning the globalisation of its brands with a detailed understanding and respect for local differences,  with  the  aim  of  winning  and  satisfying  1.5  billion consumers.  The  goal  is  to  offer  beauty  by  responding  to  the specific aspirations of consumers in every region of the world. In  contrast to standardisation, it is based on careful attention to consumers and a deep respect for their differences.\n\n## 2. One single business: beauty, nothing but beauty and all beauty\n\nFor  over  a  century,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  carried  out  a  single  business: creating  beauty.  Cosmetics  are  rich  in  meaning.  They  allow each  person  to  boost  their  self-confidence,  express  their personality and open up to others.\n\nFocusing on a single business represents a major competitive advantage  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  Group  boasts  more  than  one hundred years of cosmetic expertise, talented specialists and an in-depth knowledge of consumers. This is built on a detailed knowledge of beauty cultures, needs, desires and aspirations. L'Or\u00e9al covers all continents across more than 150 countries, all  product  categories (2) ,  all  distribution  channels  including e-commerce and Travel Retail, and all price segments.\n\nBy  focusing  its  energy  on  a  single  business,  along  with  an obsession  for  seizing  'what  is  new  and  fresh' L'Or\u00e9al is able to identify new consumer trends and  respond  rapidly.  The  digital  revolution  in  particular, in  perfect  alignment  with  'social  beauty',  connected  and shared,  acts  to  speed  up  the  development  of  the  beauty market  driven  by  economic,  technological,  demographic and sociological developments.

        "page_content": "## 3. The challenge of innovation: the strength of Research, Innovation (R&I) and Technology\n\nInnovation has been  and  remains  the  core  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  model:  the  Group  was  born  from  a  breakthrough innovation  -  safe  hair  dye  invented  by  its  founder  Eug\u00e8ne Schueller. L'Or\u00e9al believes that beauty happens when science and  creativity  come  together  to  meet  the  needs  of consumers  who  expect  new  experiences  over  and  above products  and  services.  The  discoveries  of  R&I,  as  well  as  the unique intuition and creativity of the marketing teams, mean that  products  are  constantly  evolving  to  meet  consumers' needs. Because L'Or\u00e9al records a significant share of its sales with  new  products  every  year,  the  Group  has  a  duty  to  be the champion of cosmetics innovation.\n\nOn the one hand, the beauty of the future is now focused on Green  Sciences that  reconcile  efficiency,  naturalness  and sustainability  to  give  the  Group's  products,  formulas  or packaging  a  competitive  advantage  ;  and,  on  the  other hand, on Beauty  Tech to  enhance  science  via  cutting-edge technologies  on  a  large  scale  and  to  offer  unparalleled beauty  experiences.  Innovation  is  at  the  heart  of  the  model and,  coupled  with  technology,  is  a  driving  force  for  growth and  discovery  of  new  areas  of  beauty.  Data,  artificial intelligence,  robotics  and  nanotechnologies  will  strengthen and  speed  up  the  Group's  innovations  to  help  make  it  a champion of the Beauty Tech. L'Or\u00e9al invents the beauty of the future while becoming the company of the future.\n\n## 4. Marketing of brands, products, services and of the customer experience\n\nOver  the  next  decade,  the  cosmetics  market  will  become more digital and competitive, with the arrival of new players from new markets and other industries such as fashion, luxury and  e-commerce.  In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al's  expertise  and excellence in creating and developing major brands that are prized by consumers all over the world will be essential assets. L'Or\u00e9al  has  always  been  able  to  create  star  products, from brand new franchise launches to innovations that evolve into 'icons' over time. The skills of the marketing departments for our  brands  and  laboratories  are  key  assets  in  the collaborative,  agile  design  of  new  products,  services  and customer experiences.\n\n## 5. Adapting and seizing every opportunity through multi-polar growth in each region and division\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  global  footprint  enables  it  to  steer  its  growth  by continuously adapting to the context it faces, seize opportunities  as  they  arise  and  minimise  exposure  to  areas where business is slower. In terms of regions, China is a major contributor  for  the  Group  and  is  set  to  become  the  leading beauty  market;  its  consumers  represent  a  significant  source of  growth,  both  in  the  local  market  and  in  Travel  Retail.\n\nThen,  North  America,  currently  the  premier  beauty  market, is  boosted  by  its  demographics,  the  reinforcement  of  ethnic diversity,  and  the  ongoing  acceleration  of  e-commerce. The third growth accelerator for the Group is that of emerging markets,  particularly  South-East  Asia,  India  and  the  Middle East,  with  a  population  of  3  billion;  these  markets  are  young, connected and hungry for beauty products. Although Europe remains the Group's core region as well as its historic cradle, L'Or\u00e9al is also expected to accelerate its growth in Africa and continue its expansion in other regions of the world.\n\nThe  Group's  four  divisions  enable  it  to  meet  all  consumer expectations.  The  Luxe  Division  is  now  the  Group's  primary division, responding to the desire for quality and experience in the upper-middle classes; the Consumer Products Division, the leading  division  in  terms  of  units  sold,  is  the  main  tool  for conquering  emerging  markets;  the  Dermatological  Beauty Division (1) responds to increasingly high expectations in terms of skincare  and  has  more  than  doubled  in  size  in  five  years; finally, the Professional Products  Division enhances  the sophistication of the market and the salon sector.\n\n## 6. The dual goal: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  economic  and  financial  performance  is  not sufficient. Because there will be no economic growth without sustainability  in  the  future,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  the  dual  goal of  excellence,  in  both  the  economic  and  societal  domains. It will  be  the  condition  for  its  success  and  its  long-term existence.  Because  L'Or\u00e9al  is  the  global  leader  in  beauty, it  has the duty to contribute to the beauty of the planet and be a champion of CSR. And it is because L'Or\u00e9al is a social, environmental, societal and ethical leader that it will achieve greater performance in the future. The two performances go hand in hand and mutually enhance each other, as L'Or\u00e9al has demonstrated to date.\n\n## 7. Prioritising people and social harmony\n\nIn  keeping with the legacy of our founder, Eug\u00e8ne Schueller, individuals and social harmony are at the heart of L'Or\u00e9al and must remain our priority in a climate where attracting talent is becoming  increasingly  complex.  The  Group's  values  have always  been  humanist  in  nature.  In  entrepreneurial  culture, passionate  and  committed  teams  are  the  strategic  intangible assets that always have and always will make all the difference.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  human  and  social  project  constitutes  both  the strength  and  the  appeal  of  its  model  in  an  ever-changing world.  It  is  based  around  two  priorities:  the  attention  paid to  developing  each  employee  through  ongoing  training, accelerated  career  paths  or  international  careers;  and  a unique  social  model  that  combines  competitive  social performance  and  shared  growth  (profit-sharing,  incentives, employee shareholding plan etc.).\n\nFor  more  than  15  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  and  recognised  for  its  actions worldwide. The Group's policy in this area is further developed in section 4.3.2.6.",

Stable governance\n\nThe stability of the Group's governance in a changing world makes it possible to work towards long-term objectives and to ensure regular growth.\n\n## 1.1.3.1. Loyal shareholders, stable capital structure\n\n## Shareholders as at 31 December 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Consisting, in addition of Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, of Mr Jean-Pierre Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers, along with T\u00e9thys SAS.\n- (2) Concerns the current and former employees of L'Or\u00e9al. The percentage also includes the performance shares granted in accordance with Article L. 225-197-1 of the French  Commercial  Code.  Including  1.02%  of  the  share  capital  as  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Employee  Savings  Plan  and  employee  investment  fund  as  defined  by Article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## 1.1.3.2. A balanced and committed Board of Directors, which fully plays its role of reflection and strategic impetus\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  defines  the  strategic  orientations  of L'Or\u00e9al and monitors its implementation, in accordance with its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social  and  environmental challenges of its business activity into consideration. It oversees the  management  of  both  the  financial  and  non-financial aspects,  and  ensures  the  quality  of  the  information  provided to shareholders and to the market.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  makes  it  possible  to  take into  account  the  specific  nature  of  its  shareholding  structure while  guaranteeing  the  interests  of  all  its  stakeholders. At  31  December  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised 16 members:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairman, Mr Jean-Paul Agon;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus;\n- \u00b7 three Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) from  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family,  which  owns  34.70% of  the  share  capital  -  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers;\n- \u00b7 two Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) linked to Nestl\u00e9, which owns 20.11% of the share capital Mr Paul Bulcke and Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch;\n\n- \u00b7 seven independent Directors: Ms Sophie Bellon, Ms  Fabienne  Dulac,  Ms  Bel\u00e9n  Garijo,  Ms  Ilham  Kadri, Ms Virginie Morgon, Mr Patrice Caine and Mr Alexandre Ricard. 50%  of  the  Directors  are  therefore  independent  (7  out  of  14 excluding the Directors representing the employees); and\n- \u00b7 two Directors representing the employees: Mr Thierry Hamel and Mr Benny de Vlieger.\n\nThe Board takes steps to ensure that the Directors come from different  backgrounds,  that  most  of  them  have  international experience acquired in groups with a global dimension, and that  they  have  complementary  skills  (see  section  2.2.1.2.). The diversity of skills  and  expertise  on  the  Board  enables it  to understand rapidly and in detail the development challenges that L'Or\u00e9al faces.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  attentive  to  compliance  with  the  principle  of balanced  gender  representation  on  the  Board:  50%  of  its members are women (1) and three Board Committees out of four are chaired by women.",

Ongoing transformation to meet new aspirations\n\nWith  \u20ac38.26  billion  in  net  sales  and  nearly  87,400  employees in 2022, L'Or\u00e9al is the world leader in beauty.\n\nBecause the beauty market is a growing market with a focus on the future, the Group is, now more than ever, in a position to seize all opportunities, strengthen its leadership and ensure tomorrow's success. Building on a long-term vision, with a clear strategy,  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  its  development  by  relying  on  its fundamental  assets  and  transforming  itself  to  respond  to  the new  aspirations  of  consumers,  employees  and  society, to become the company of the future.\n\n## Digital transformation to become the champion\n\nDigital technology has radically transformed the Group, and is fully integrated in the business, in all brands, jobs and countries. It  is  based  on  a  solid  network  of  over  3,800  digital  experts, almost  62,000  trained  employees  and  a  wealth  of  in-house know-how. Digital has boosted L'Or\u00e9al's strengths tenfold and represents a booster of opportunities and growth. It enhances the  power  of  brands  and  products,  enriches  the  connection with  consumers  and  creates  experiences,  new  services  and personalisation.\n\nE-commerce is an additional source of business, and a growth accelerator because it means we can reach new consumers wherever  there  is  no  existing  distribution  network.  The proportion  of  the  Group's  sales  represented  by  e-commerce multiplied by nearly 6 between 2015 and 2022 (5% to 28% (1) ), with growth in all Zones and Divisions. L'Or\u00e9al aims to increase its  e-commerce  business  to  reach  up  to  50%  of  its  sales. This  means  strengthening  its  industrial  flexibility,  adapting  its supply chain in an 'omnichannel' approach and redesigning the downstream value chain immediately.\n\nThe  new  frontier  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  digital  adventure  is  the Metaverse, which will provide infinite opportunities to interact with consumers and even market products in virtual universes.\n\n## Transformation to Beauty Tech to invent the beauty of the future\n\nTechnology,  particularly  Beauty  Tech,  is  the  future  of  beauty because of the phenomenal  breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, 3D  printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, etc., which make it possible to expand L'Or\u00e9al's offering and satisfy all consumer expectations.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al,  which  is  already  a  digital-first  company,  decided  to be the pioneer, champion and leader of Beauty Tech in all its areas of application. By building up state-of-the-art, secure IT, its  leadership  in  Beauty  Tech  and  its  expertise  in  artificial intelligence and data will enable L'Or\u00e9al to be a data-driven company for  all  its  activities  and  business  lines.  The  ongoing\n\ntransformation of Operations towards greater agility is integral to the Group's ambition to become a world leader in Beauty Tech.\n\nBeauty Tech will ensure that beauty for all evolves into beauty for  each  person.  To  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique strength:  being  the  only  company  that  can  combine  more than  110  years  of  scientific  beauty  expertise  and  knowledge of our consumers with cutting-edge digital excellence.\n\n## Transformation of our formulation towards Green Sciences, to combine performance, safety and sustainability\n\nThe  transformation  of  our  formulations  towards  the  Green Sciences is  at  the  heart  of  the  beauty  of  the  future.  This  new frontier of research, which combines biotechnology with new agronomic  and  cultivation  techniques,  is  making  it  possible for  L'Or\u00e9al  to  expand  its  portfolio  of  raw  materials  and to develop ingredients with a favourable environmental profile to  break  free  from  petrochemicals.  This  programme  helps  to minimise  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the cultivation  of  the  plants  these  ingredients  are  sourced  from, so  as  to  rely  on  eco-friendly  transformation  procedures. This transition will provide consumers with performance, safety and  sustainability,  and  L'Or\u00e9al  with  a  new  competitive advantage.\n\n## Transformation towards an increasingly sustainable business model, within the planetary boundaries defined by science\n\nThrough its L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, L'Or\u00e9al has set itself  a  number  of  ambitious  targets  for  combating  climate change:  in  terms  of  reducing  its  CO   emissions  in  order  to achieve  'carbon  neutral'  status 2 (2) for  its  sites,  in  terms  of  the use  and  recycling  of  water  in  its  industrial  processes  and  in terms  of  its  product  design  (formulation  and  packaging) through bio-sourcing and the circular economy.\n\nOn the social front, L'Or\u00e9al ensures that its strategic suppliers pay their employees a decent living wage and adopts policies to  help  people  from  disadvantaged  communities  to  access employment. The Group has also committed on the one hand to supporting women in vulnerable situations with a charitable endowment  fund  of  \u20ac50  million,  and  secondly,  to  investing \u20ac100 million in two investment funds dedicated to the circular economy  and  the  regeneration  of  ecosystems.  In  2022, L'Or\u00e9al  co-founded  the  EcoBeautyScore  Consortium,  with more  than  fifty  players  from  the  beauty  sector,  to  set  up  a scheme  to  indicate  the  environmental  impact  of  cosmetic products  so  that  consumers  can  make  more  sustainable choices.",

In  this  new  'hybrid'  working  environment,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  opted for  balanced  and  flexible  solutions  between  on-site  and remote  working  to  preserve  and  promote  opportunities  for exchange, cooperation and creativity.\n\nFurthermore,  in  a  context  of  accelerated  digitalisation  of consumption,  production,  distribution  and  communication methods,  the  Group  anticipated  the  global  impact  these transformations  will  have  on  its  structure  by  continuing  to develop  its  employees'  skills  in  these  areas,  as  well  as  by\n\nrecruiting new expertise, particularly in the field of technology. Thanks  to  its  various  initiatives,  L'Or\u00e9al  took  5   place  in  the Universum  global  ranking  2022  of  business  school  students' preferred  companies  for  the  second  consecutive  year. The  Group  is  the  highest-ranked  EU  multinational  company in this prestigious ranking. th\n\n## Ongoing structural transformation to rationalise and identify synergies\n\nIn  spring  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  an  initiative  entitled  NEXT  to simplify  its  structures  with  a  view  to  a  post-Covid  world. This  review  involves  simplifying  the  organisation  (by  creating five  internal  shared  service  centres  and  seven  geographic areas),  reviewing  the  brand  portfolio  of  each  Division  on  an annual basis, and finally, simplifying the number of products in each  brand's  catalogue  to  reduce  complex  manufacturing and research.\n\n## 1.2.8. The mission of the Research department: responsible, inclusive innovation, in absolute safety\n\nThe  cosmetics  market  is  driven  by  supply  and  innovation. L'Or\u00e9al's  success  is  fed  by  its  permanent  obsession  for innovation, which feeds into its performance in all its forms.\n\nWith more than 4,222 researchers and spending of approximately 3% of sales, L'Or\u00e9al has the top R&I force in the cosmetics industry. This is a considerable asset, with a level of expertise  and  a  wealth  of  unique  scientific  and  technical data.  The  performance,  security  and  absolute  safety  of ingredients,  the  superior  quality  of  the  products  and  the sincerity  of  their  claims  are  the  fundamentals  that  inspire the Group's laboratory teams every day.\n\n## From upstream to downstream\n\nAdvanced Research teams create, develop and source raw materials,  drawing  on  the  knowledge  of  skin  and  hair  from around  the  world.  The  Application  Domains  teams  develop formula architectures that improve the performance of active ingredients.  The  Development  Laboratories  create  innovative formulas  with  a  proven  superiority  for  each  brand.  This innovation model is nurtured by a constant dialogue between the laboratories and marketing to respond to the expectations of  consumers,  supporting  them  with  the  latest  technological breakthroughs.\n\n## Research facilities around the world\n\nIn  order  to  adapt  to  consumer  expectations  worldwide, L'Or\u00e9al's  Research  teams  work  in  20  cosmetics  research centres and 13 assessment centres. The research centres are grouped  into  three  global  centres  in  France  and  6  regional hubs (1) that  identify  consumer  needs  and  study  their  beauty regimes.  R&I  teams  build  on  this  rich  seam  of  local  scientific ecosystems to develop  collaboration agreements  and partnerships  of  excellence.  The  data  generated  enables researchers to develop new beauty products or experiences, that are in tune with market needs and local expectations.\n\n## R&I: a vast ecosystem open to the world\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  have  completely revolutionised  the  way  we  understand  and  do  science, which focuses on three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 sustainable cultivation to reinvent the way we grow our raw materials. By applying these responsible agricultural techniques, L'Or\u00e9al is preserving water resources, contributing to  soil  health  and  strengthening  biodiversity  while  limiting greenhouse gas emissions and respecting populations and their ecosystems ;\n- \u00b7 green transformation such as biotechnology, green extraction and green chemistry, to extract and transform raw materials to obtain the ingredients required for  formulations ;\n\n- \u00b7 formulation sciences, which, by combining ingredients from Green  Sciences,  enable  us  to  offer  responsible  and sustainable  products  to  consumers,  while  complying  with our safety and performance requirements.\n\n## 'Sustainable' partnerships\n\nThe R&I teams worldwide are bringing about a new scientific revolution  in  cosmetics,  based  on  the  principle:  Science  x Nature  x  Technologies.  This  dynamic  innovation  ecosystem makes  it  possible  to  increase  the  opportunities  for  research and innovation to:\n\n- \u00b7 explore new areas of knowledge;\n- \u00b7 transform the portfolio of raw materials through partnerships (e.g. Microphyt for microalgae) ; (1)\n- \u00b7 innovate in extended labs with the Green Sciences Incubator, thereby supporting start-ups.",

Developed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  scientists  and  engineers, HAPTA is  a  handheld,  ultra-precise  smart  makeup  applicator for users with limited hand and arm mobility, offering them the ability  to  apply  lipstick  at  home (1) .  HAPTA  will  help  individuals feel more independent, confident, and empowered to enjoy the self-expressive power of beauty (2) . HAPTA will be launched in  2023  by  Lanc\u00f4me,  first  as  a  lipstick  applicator  followed by additional makeup applications.\n\nOur technological innovations in the beauty domain received 16  awards,  including  six  innovation  awards  at  the  2023 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and for the third year running,  the  judges'  prize  in  the  'Augmented  Beauty' category of Time Magazine's special edition dedicated to the 100 Best Inventions of the year.\n\n## New levels of performance for the Group's iconic anti-ageing ingredient: Pro-Xylane\n\nTwenty  years  after  Pro-Xylane  was  first  discovered,  R&I unveils  a  new  raw  material:  Pro-Xylane  PRO.  A  product of glycobiology (3) , Pro-Xylane improves the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans,  molecules  that  play  a  key  role  in  the skin's  ageing  process.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  published  12  scientific publications  and  filed  more  than  70  patent  applications worldwide for this innovative anti-ageing active ingredient.\n\n## UVMune 400, the first sun filtering technology to effectively protect against ultra-long UVA rays\n\nUVA and UVB rays are some of the main causes of skin cancer. It is essential to stay protected from these rays throughout your lifetime.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  a  long  history  of  expertise  in  the development  of  sunscreens,  starting  with  its  patenting  of Mexoryl SX in 1982, and of Mexoryl XL in 1989. Together these products protect against UVB and short UVA rays, but are less effective  against  ultra-long  UVA,  the  30%  of  solar  rays  that have so far been insufficiently filtered and which cause deep skin  damage. After 10 years of research in collaboration with BASF, in 2021 L'Or\u00e9al launched UVMune 400, a solar filtration technology  powered  by  Mexoryl  400,  the  first  solar  filter  to absorb  ultra-long  UVA  rays  so  effectively.  This  is  the  Group's biggest  suncare  innovation  in  30  years.  This  technology  is behind the launch of La Roche-Posay's Anthelios UVMune 400, a  hybrid  product  that  provides  both  seasonal  and  daily protection.\n\n## Inclusivity at each stage of L'Or\u00e9al's innovation model\n\n## Enhancing the inclusivity of beauty experiences with a more thorough knowledge of consumers in their infinite diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  aims  to  offer  the  best  in  beauty  for  all  skin  and  hair types,  all  genders,  all  identities,  cultures,  age  groups,  beauty regimes and all lifestyles. Research places learning about skin and hair from around the world at the heart of its innovation strategy, so as to better understand consumers in their infinite diversity.\n\nThis makes it possible to :\n\n- \u25cf identify the technical and emotional drivers connected with the expectations and specific needs of each consumer ;\n- \u25cf better anticipate the technological and digital issues of the beauty of the future ;\n- \u25cf evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  beauty  routines  in  the  most appropriate and inclusive way possible.\n\n## Designing the future of beauty with 'Typology', an extensive international study\n\nIn 2022, R&I launched the 'Typology' programme, which aims to enhance its expertise in the diversity and representativeness of  individuals  worldwide,  so  as  to  develop  inclusive  services, in compliance with applicable regulations.\n\nThe  study  targeted  8  countries  and  15,000  volunteers  of all  genders,  ages,  phototypes,  hair  types  and  ethnic  origins. It  aims  to  collect  reliable  information  and  personal  data  on a sample of people representing more than half of the world's population. Only the data required for this study, provided to L'Or\u00e9al  in  an  anonymised  format,  was  collected (4) .  The  study of  this  data  sample  provides  a  better  understanding  of  the issues  consumers  encounter  in  their  beauty  routines,  country of residence and environment.\n\n## Developing objective evaluation methods and diagnostic tools that are increasingly inclusive\n\nThe market is changing and there is strong growth in demand for  personalised  services  and  diagnostics.  In  order  to  offer consumers made-to-measure experiences, L'Or\u00e9al uses clinical  skin  diagnostics  that  take  this  diversity  into  account. In 2022, the Research teams designed an inclusive clinical skin diagnosis  tool  based  on  Artificial  Intelligence,  using  the  data from  this study, making  it  possible  for  algorithms  and conclusions to be sufficiently corroborated. The performance of  this  algorithm  was  then  validated  and  confirmed  in  an inclusive  study  in  the  United  States,  where  subjects  and dermatologists  met  numerous  diversity  criteria.  This  essential study  has  also  been  the  subject  of  a  scientific  publication, co-written by Dr Nina Jablonski and Dr Aur\u00e9lie Jean, who are members  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Global  Diversity,  Equity  &  Inclusion Advisory Board.",

        "page_content": "## Research with commitment, in full transparency\n\n## Beauty without animal testing\n\nIn  the  1980s,  Group  committed  to  developing  alternatives  to animal  testing  to  assess  the  safety  of  its  ingredients  and  its products. Today, none of the Group's products or ingredients are tested on animals by L'Or\u00e9al. L'Or\u00e9al definitively stopped the safety testing of its products on animals in 1989. The Group believes  that  there  are  other  effective  ways  of  ensuring  that cosmetic products are safe.  Over  40  years  ago,  L'Or\u00e9al  was the  first  company  to  develop  reconstructed  skin,  which  is  a more  accurate  way  to  test  the  effects  of  ingredients  and cosmetic  products  on  human  skin  than  any  other  method; this  is  currently  the  case  in  the  laboratories  of  L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiary,  Episkin,  in  France,  China  and  Brazil.  It  is  available to  governments,  organisations  and  other  companies  so  they do not have to resort to animal testing.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  contributed  to  the  approval  of  dozens  of  alternative methods of testing the safety of its products and has also been active in advocating for alternative methods in China. L'Or\u00e9al has  been  working  with  the  Chinese  authorities  for  over 10  years  on  introducing  methods  that  are  free  from  animal testing  for  all  cosmetic  products.  Over  the  last  few  years, China  abolished  the  requirement  to  carry  out  animal  testing that applies to most cosmetics sold in the country. Since 2014, the Chinese authorities no longer test non-functional cosmetics (such  as  shampoo  or  make-up)  that  are  manufactured locally. Since 2021, these same cosmetics imported into China no  longer  need  to  be  tested  on  animals,  subject  to  a certificate of compliance with manufacturing best practices.\n\nIn  2022,  Episkin  launched  a  new  innovative  reconstructed cornea  model  (HCE  SkinEthic ),  which  is  already  available in  Brazil,  Argentina,  Colombia  and  Chile.  Based  on  this  new model,  the  Time-To-Toxicity  (TTT)  evaluation  method  was included in the OECD \u2122 (1) test guidelines in 2022. Approval of this method  has  made  it  possible  to  predict  eye  irritation  with  a single in vitro test. This is a major step in the fight against animal testing.\n\n## Transparency: a key challenge in recent years and for the future\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to strengthen its commitment to transparency  in  order  to  meet  growing  consumer  demand for information about the composition of products. Launched in  2019,  the  'Inside  our  Products'  website  is  available  in 45  countries  and  in  8  languages,  and  references  more  than 1,300 ingredients. This content is gradually being added to the websites  of  the  Group's  major  brands.  At  the  same  time, the  expansion  of  the  Product  Impact  Labelling  (PIL)  system provides  consumers  with  information  on  the  environmental and  social  impact  of  certain  products  in  the  Garnier, La  Roche-Posay,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  Vichy  and  Biotherm  brands  in France.  The  latest  transparency  initiative  is  the  InFragrance scheme: based on an analysis of 20,000 perfume formulas and thanks  to  the  collaboration  of  our  main  fragrance  suppliers (Firmenich,  Givaudan,  IFF  and  Mane),  this  approach  allows consumers  to  understand  the  natural  or  synthetic  origin  of ingredients,  their  olfactory  properties  and  the  way  in  which they are combined to create the fragrance of products. As a responsible  leader  in  the  beauty  industry,  L'Or\u00e9al  would  like this  model  to  be  open  to  other  players  in  the  sector,  both manufacturers and retailers, so as to provide more transparency to consumers.\n\n## 1.2.9. Operations, specialised expertise and core values to contribute to growth\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Operations Division creates innovative, inclusive and sustainable  beauty  in  collaboration  with  its  partners.  They harness  the  power  of  technology  and  strive  for  excellence to  design,  develop,  supply,  produce  and  distribute  products and  services  worldwide.  Consumers  are  at  the  heart  of  the decisions  made  by  the  Operations  Division,  which  seeks the  most  agile  and  effective  solutions,  and  guarantees compliance  with  strict  standards  of  quality,  safety  and  CSR at the global level.\n\n## Resilience and transformation for growth\n\nRelying on an approach of operational excellence conducted for  years,  the  expertise  and  commitment  of  the  Operations teams  have  boosted  the  Group's  growth.  In  a  challenging global context, they have demonstrated their agility and  resilience,  while  pursuing  their  digital,  sustainable  and innovative  transformation.  The  high-technology  industry  is  at\n\nthe  heart  of  the  Operations  Division,  and  this  enhances  its agility  across  the  entire  value  chain,  enabling  it  to  meet market challenges.\n\nThanks  to  science  and  new  technologies,  the  Operations Division  can  be  innovative  and  is  able  provide  a  specific response  to  the  new  challenges  posed  by  consumer expectations for personalisation, agility and traceability, on the one  hand,  and  to  the  employee  experience  on  the  other, such  as  simplification,  ergonomics  and  real-time  access  to information.\n\nIn  production, the combination of new technologies and the deployment  of  additional capacity worldwide provide flexible  and  agile  production  solutions.  The  omnichannel transformation  of  the  supply  chain  continues,  providing  an optimised  customer  experience  and  increased  interaction with  consumers,  and  responsibly  promoting  the  use  of  new technologies (IoT (2) , connected products, big data).",

Thanks to science, experience and performance, packaging is a key differentiating factor for the product and therefore of its perceived value creation for the consumer. The L'Or\u00e9al teams, distributed over five Packaging Hubs around  the  world,  specialise  in  design,  consumer experience,  innovation  and  product  development.  They  rely on  the  expertise  of  laboratories  dedicated  to  materials  and packaging  to  create  cutting-edge  innovations  worldwide. L'Or\u00e9al filed 50 patents for packaging in 2022.\n\nSince 2007, L'Or\u00e9al has adopted an eco-design process for its packaging.  This  process  comprises  three  steps:  Reduce  the intensity of packaging and thus use fewer resources; Replace impactful  materials  with  materials  that  have  a  better environmental footprint (renewable, post-consumer recycled); Recycle  by  creating  packaging  that  contributes  to  the circular economy.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  97%  of  the  Group's  products  have  an improved  environmental  or  social  profile (1) .  By  2030,  100%  of the plastic used in the packaging of L'Or\u00e9al products will be either  recycled  or  bio-sourced  and  L'Or\u00e9al  will  reduce  the volume of packaging used for its products by 20% compared to  2019.  In  2022,  78.1%  of  the  PET  plastic  used  came  from recycled sources.\n\nPursuing  its  strategy  to  participate  in  the  circular  economy, in  2022  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  a  partnership  with  US  chemicals company  Eastman  for  a  multi-year  contract  for  the  supply of plastic produced from the molecular recycling of polyester waste.\n\n## A purchasing programme that combines economic, environmental and social value with the highest standards in terms of quality and security\n\nTo  accompany  the  Group's  growth,  Purchasing  Department selects  the  most  economically,  environmentally  and  socially effective suppliers in accordance with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care responsible purchasing policy. Supplier performance is monitored  thanks  to  precise  indicators  relating  to  social,\n\nenvironmental  and  ethical  criteria  and  through  their  ability to  innovate  and  to  meet  the  Group's  requirements  in  terms of quality, agility, service and competitiveness.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  builds  solid  relationships  with  its  suppliers  to  ensure  its procurement  is  responsible  and  to  guarantee  the  flexibility, reliability  and  traceability  of  its  supply  streams.  In  a  climate of  tension  and volatility,  these  long-term  supplier  relationships play  a  key  role  in  the  Group's  ability  to  secure  the  volume and  price  of  its  raw  materials  supplies.  In  2022,  the  Group conducted  1,145  social  audits,  a  total  of  more  than  16,000 since 2006.\n\nFrom 2010, L'Or\u00e9al chose to engage with suppliers that have an  inclusive  solidarity  model  in  order  to  provide  access  to employment  for  people  from  economically  or  socially disadvantaged communities, such as people with a disability,  the  long-term  unemployed  or  fair-trade  suppliers (see  section  4.3.3.6.).  At  the  end  of  2022,  85,544  people  had been  able  to  access  employment  via  L'Or\u00e9al's  Solidarity Sourcing programme.\n\n## Manufacturing performance that relies on a global system combining agility with operational excellence\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has 38 high-tech factories around the world, located close  to  its  consumer  markets.  This  network  of  plants  is constantly  evolving  to  accommodate  the  growth  of  the Group, incorporate acquisitions, embrace external innovations and  adapt  to  rapid  changes  in  the  beauty  market.  It  is supported  by  a  network  of  subcontracting  partners  to  deal with cyclical peaks in demand.\n\nThe  Group's  manufacturing  organisation  is  also  based  on specialisation  by  technology (2) to  maximise  best  practices, increase agility, improve productivity and  to  optimise investments. As such, the Aulnay-sous-Bois factory in the Paris region,  which  celebrated  its  30th  year  of  operation  in  2022, has  adapted to  manufacture perfumes for the  Luxe  Division, in response to a growth in demand. This site is a prime example of  L'Or\u00e9al's  agility,  its  expertise  in  'French-style  luxury'  and the  territorial  connection  of  its  manufacturing  base.  In  2022, the Operations Division also adjusted its skincare manufacturing  capacity  worldwide,  with  major  projects  in the United States, North Asia and Europe (France), in response to strong growth in this category.",

This is a systemic approach  that  relies  on  the  commitment  of  all  Operations employees in technical fields, process control and the culture of  operational  excellence,  to  guarantee  safety,  hygiene, quality,  product  availability,  levels  of  service,  productivity, ergonomics and environmental impact.\n\n(1)\n\n## Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nOffering consumers the highest quality product is an absolute priority.  Over several decades, the Group has set up a single product quality and safety management  programme that  applies  to  all  its  plants  and  subsidiaries  around  the world.  In 2022,  97%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  plants  were  ISO  9001 (Quality  Management)  certified  and  100%  were  ISO  22716 (Best cosmetics manufacturing practices) compliant.\n\nThis unique quality management system guarantees manufacturing  excellence  and  the  quality  of  products  with the same high standards applicable everywhere in the world. It  includes efficient production methods and stringent control standards:  around  100  quality  controls  are  carried  out  on  a single  product  during  the  production  cycle,  from  the  input of  raw  materials  and  packaging  to  when  products  leave the plant and heads towards customers and consumers.\n\nThe ongoing quality improvement process has been effective as  seen  in  the  low  rate  of  consumer  complaints  in  2022: 46 complaints per million products sold (1) .",

(2)\n\nAll sites in the North Asia Zone (continental China, Japan, South Korea,  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan)  and  those  in  L'Or\u00e9al  Brazil became 'carbon neutral' (3) in 2022 (see section 4.3.1.1.3.).\n\nAt year-end 2022, there were five Waterloop factories (Burgos in Spain, Settimo in Italy, Vorsino in Russia, Libramont in Belgium and Yichang in  China):  all  the  water  required  by  the  utilities (equipment  cleaning,  steam  production  etc.)  comes  from reused  water  or  water  recycled  in  a  closed  loop  on  the  site (see section 4.3.1.1.4.).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  for  over  25  years  to  environmental leadership was recognised in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 with the  best  possible  rating  by  the  CDP (3) :  a  triple 'A'. L'Or\u00e9al is thus the only company in the world, out of more than  12,000  companies  assessed,  to  receive  a  triple  'A' ranking  for  the  seventh consecutive year, for its  commitment and  results  in  the  three  key  areas:  the  fight  against  climate change, sustainable water management and the fight against deforestation.\n\n## A responsible, omnichannel logistics strategy\n\nThe Group's Supply Chain  Department organises and optimises  the  delivery  of  every  one  of  the  over  6.5  billion L'Or\u00e9al  products  to  all  customers,  as  well  as  directly  to consumers. It is responsible for making sure that the products are delivered under optimum conditions, at the right time and at  the  best  cost.  The  Supply  Chain  Department and  its distribution  centres  were  particularly  strategic  and  responsive in  2022  in  order  to  support  L'Or\u00e9al's  growth  in  an  extremely volatile market.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  unique  features  in  a  global  market  are  its  diverse range  of  distribution  channels  and  its  portfolio  of  many different  beauty  and  cosmetic  product  categories.

Digitalisation  of  the  supply chain  and  data management  are  critical  challenges,  and  represent  a  real opportunity,  especially  in  the  retail  sector  and  in  stores managed directly by L'Or\u00e9al. It can provide a comprehensive view of business in a store, as well as improve understanding of the consumer purchase journey.\n\nThe supply chain network composed of 152 distribution centres is a  strategic  lever  to  ensure  agile  coverage  of  market challenges  and  expand  our  service  offer.  To  create  a  more responsive  supply chain,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  investing  in  its  distribution centres  to  gradually  transform  them  into  Fulfilment Centres (1) : powered by automation and data, they manage a range of services to consumers such as personalisation, box preparation and tailor-made delivery. They facilitate stock interoperability for omnichannel management and allow enhanced product traceability.  In  2022,  in  Suzhou  in  China,  L'Or\u00e9al  began constructing its first  'Intelligent  Fulfilment  Centre'  to  enhance its offering of personalised beauty services and experiences.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  its  environmental  footprint,  L'Or\u00e9al  is co-creating  with  carriers  low-carbon  multimodal  solutions adapted  to  the  specific  features  of  each  geographic  zone (green  delivery,  reduced  air  freight,  hydrogen  engines  etc.). To improve the energy efficiency of its plants, L'Or\u00e9al is rolling out  the  use  of  100%  renewable  energy  worldwide.  In  2022, L'Or\u00e9al  and  its  partners  opened  the  Group's  second  largest Latin  American  distribution  centre  in  Jarinu,  Brazil.  As  an eco-construction, this distribution centre uses 100% renewable energy.\n\nThe  new  Vennecy  distribution  centre  in  France  has  been  in operation since October 2022 for the distribution of consumer products.  Exemplary  in  terms  of  environmental  performance (enhanced  insulation,  optimised  mix  of  natural/LED  lighting, passive  air  conditioning,  roof-top  photovoltaic  power  system and  biomass-fired  boilers), this centre uses data  and automation  to  optimise  flows  and  accentuate  its  ability  to adapt to the markets.\n\n## Global economic performance at the service of the brands and the commercial entities\n\nIn a climate of short and long-terms global tension, the Operations Division plays a key economic role for all brands and markets, which has an impact on the overall cost of products and their distribution.\n\nEconomic optimisation efforts led by Operations involve tracking the total landed cost, i.e., the final full cost of a product, which includes the cost of packaging and raw materials, the value added by the plants and all supply chain costs.\n\n## Commitment to invest in Operations\n\n(Production and supply chain commitments in \u20ac millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProduction and sales of the operational Divisions by geographic zone in 2022: production close to its markets",

Comparable  growth  vs.  2019 accelerated quarter after quarter and reached +23% over the  full  year.  Our  balanced  growth  across  Divisions  and regions  once  again  demonstrates  the  relevance  of  our multipolar model: strategically centralised and operationally decentralised  with  a  strong  entrepreneurial  mindset,  this model  is  ideally  suited  to  the  current  environment.\n\nWe have emerged stronger from 2022 and reinforced our position  as  the  world's  leading  beauty  company.  These high-quality results allow us to consistently support our social and  environmental  commitments,  in  line  with  our  dual ambition of economic and corporate performance. Mindful of  the  current  uncertainties,  we  remain  ambitious  for  the future, optimistic about the outlook for the beauty market, and  confident  in  our  ability  to  keep  outperforming  the market and achieve in 2023 another year of growth in sales and profits.'\n\n## 1.3.1.1.

At  the  same  time,  growth  accelerated  significantly  in  Latin America  and  SAPMENA-SSA,  with  remarkable  performance in  high-potential  countries  such  as  Mexico,  India  and  Brazil. This  more  than  compensated  for  the  challenging  market conditions in China, where the Division accelerated its market share gains in the fourth quarter.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al Luxe\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  recorded  strong  growth,  at  +10.2%  like-for-like and  +18.6%  reported, outperforming  a  global  luxury  beauty market that proved dynamic again this year.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  strengthened  its  leadership  in  fragrance,  the fastest-growing category in the selective market. This performance  was  driven  by  global  bestsellers,  such  as Libre by Yves Saint Laurent , La Vie Est Belle by Lanc\u00f4me and Acqua di Gio by Armani ,  as  well as launches that had an impressive start,  including Prada Paradoxe . In  skincare,  the  Division grew  three  times  faster  than  the  market,  spurred  by  the ultra-premium  segment,  with  a  spectacular  performance from Helena  Rubinstein , cutting-edge  innovations  such  as Lanc\u00f4me 's R\u00e9nergie  H.C.F  Triple  Serum ,  and  the  success  of recent  acquisitions  including  the  Japanese  brand Takami. The  Division  also  grew  in  makeup,  thanks  to  the  initiatives  of Yves Saint Laurent and Urban Decay .\n\nIn an unsettled environment, particularly in the second half of the  year  with  the  drastic  slowdown  of  the  Chinese  market, the Division confirmed the strength of its geographic footprint which  has  allowed  it  to  reinforce  its  global  market  share since 2019. The Division grew in step with the market in Europe and significantly increased its position in North Asia.",

The  Division  posted  double-digit  growth  in  all  Zones,  with  a remarkable performance in North America, SAPMENA-SSA and mainland  China. La  Roche-Posay and CeraVe contributed equally to the Division's growth. La Roche-Posay ,  the  Division's biggest brand, sustained its outstanding momentum, driven by its  main  pillars Cicaplast and Effaclar ,  and  by  the  success  of the UVMune  400 breakthrough  innovation  in  sun  protection. CeraVe continued  to  expand  internationally,  achieving spectacular growth in both the United States and the rest of the  world. Vichy maintained  its  strong  momentum  thanks  to Dercos and  the Capital  Soleil  UV franchise  in  both  seasonal and daily sun protection. On the aesthetic front, SkinCeuticals recorded  double-digit  growth,  fuelled  by  the  excellent performance  of A.G.E  Interrupter anti-wrinkle  cream.  The newly  acquired  brand Skinbetter  Science , integrated  into the Division in the fourth quarter, showed promising potential.\n\n## Summary by geographic Zone\n\n## Europe\n\n## The Zone achieved growth of +11.6% like-for-like and +12.3% reported .\n\nThe  European  beauty  market  grew  beyond  pre-pandemic levels,  driven  by  fragrance,  makeup  and  sun  protection. It  remained  dynamic  during  the  second  half  of  the  year despite rising inflation. L'Or\u00e9al again significantly outperformed the  market  thanks  to  its  diversified  offering,  which  meets  the needs of all consumer segments, and its valorisation strategy, allowing  Europe  to  be  the  Group's  number  one  growth contributor  this  year.  L'Or\u00e9al  outperformed  in  the  majority  of countries, especially Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. The  Central  European  countries  posted  very  strong  growth. L'Or\u00e9al also continued to outperform in e-commerce.\n\nThe Consumer Products Division achieved its strongest growth of the last few years, driven by its makeup rebound and highly successful launches. Leading the fragrances category, L'Or\u00e9al Luxe  had  further  success . The  Active  Cosmetics  Division outperformed  across  the  Zone  thanks  to  the  success  of La  Roche-Posay and CeraVe, which  continued  to  expand rapidly.  Finally,  the  Professional  Products  Division  successfully pursued  its  valorisation  strategy,  significantly  contributing  to the growth of premium haircare in the Zone.\n\n## North America\n\nThe  Zone  ended  the  year  at  +10.4%  like-for-like  and  +24.6% reported ,  reaching  the  10  billion  euro  mark  in  sales.  Strong innovation,  operational  agility  and  well-executed  valorisation of the offer amid rising inflation were instrumental in achieving this milestone.\n\nThe  Consumer  Products  Division  strengthened  its  position, outperforming  the  makeup  market  led  by NYX  Professional Makeup and Maybelline New York . L'Or\u00e9al Luxe outperformed the market in fragrance, thanks to its unique portfolio and key launches  like Prada  Paradoxe and Viktor  &  Rolf  Good Fortune .  The  Professional  Products  Division  remained  strong  in the  salon  channel  and  through  the  SalonCentric  platform, significantly  outpacing  the  market  ;  it  performed  particularly well  in  haircare,  with Pureology and K\u00e9rastase. The  Active Cosmetics  Division  closed  the  year  with  strong  double-digit growth,  well  ahead  of  the  dermocosmetics  market. CeraVe and La  Roche-Posay maintained  good  momentum  ;  the acquisition of the US skincare brand Skinbetter Science got off to a strong start.\n\n## North Asia\n\n## The  Zone  ended  the  year  at  +6.6%  like-for-like  and  +14.8% based on reported figures.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  unique  brand  portfolio  and  its  digital  excellence were  once  again  key  drivers  to  outperform  throughout  the Zone, in all markets and all channels. The Professional Products and  Active  Cosmetics  Divisions  continued  their  double-digit growth, leveraging their premium  brand  portfolio.  The Consumer  Products  Division  capitalised  on L'Or\u00e9al  Paris' notable success in the skincare and haircare categories, and on 3CE Stylenanda growth momentum. L'Or\u00e9al Luxe achieved robust growth  in a negative market; this remarkable performance was driven by premium skincare, fragrance and the strong acceleration of Yves Saint Laurent across the Zone.\n\nIn mainland China, the beauty market was clearly affected by the  public  health  restrictions.  In  this  challenging  context, L'Or\u00e9al  grew  appreciably,  with  a  double-digit  increase  in online  sales.  Leveraging  brand  love  and  operational  agility, L'Or\u00e9al  succeeded  in  providing  consumers  with  quality premium  and  innovative  products.  This  remarkable  success resulted  in  strong  offline  and  online  market  share  gains throughout the year, as well as during Double 11, the world's biggest shopping festival ; L'Or\u00e9al brands topped the rankings for  each beauty category on Tmall, further consolidating the Group's leadership, notably in luxury, where L'Or\u00e9al surpassed 30% of market share in 2022.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  recorded  double-digit  growth  in  Japan  and  Korea, where  it  outperformed  the  beauty  market,  which  bounced back strongly in 2022.\n\nAll  L'Or\u00e9al  sites  in  the  North  Asia  Zone  became  'carbon neutral' (2) in 2022.",

Consumers  returned to stores and  L'Or\u00e9al  recorded  booming  sales  in  the brick-and-mortar  channel.  In  the  Pacific,  growth  was  mainly driven by the fragrance and skincare categories, notably with the  expansion  of La  Roche  Posay and CeraVe. Maybelline New  York makeup  and Garnier skincare both  fuelled progression across South-East Asia. The spectacular growth in India was spurred by the success of the Professional Products Division and  the  Consumer  Products  Division  across  all categories.  Growth  in  the  Gulf  States  continued  to  gather momentum.\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), L'Or\u00e9al significantly outperformed the  market  thanks  to  the  dynamism  of  all  Divisions,  with  the Active  Cosmetics  Division  achieving  spectacular  growth following the successful launch of CeraVe in the region.\n\n## 1.3.1.3.  2022 Consolidated results\n\n## Operating profitability and consolidated income statement\n\n|                                              | 2020       | 2020         | 2021       | 2021         | 2022       | 2022         |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------|\n|                                              | \u20ac millions | % 2020 sales | \u20ac millions | % 2021 sales | \u20ac millions | % 2022 sales |\n| Sales                                        | 27,992.1   | 100.0%       | 32,287.6   | 100.0%       | 38 260.6   | 100.0%       |\n| Cost of sales                                | -7,532.3   | 26.9%        | -8,433.3   | 26.1%        | - 10 577.4 | 27.6%        |\n| Gross profit                                 | 20,459.8   | 73.1%        | 23,854.3   | 73.9%        | 27 683.3   | 72.4%        |\n| R&I expenses                                 | -964.4     | 3.4%         | -1,028.7   | 3.2%         | - 1 138.6  | 3.0%         |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           | -8,647.9   | 30.9%        | -10,591.0  | 32.8%        | - 12 059.0 | 31.5%        |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses | -5,638.5   | 20,1 %       | -6,074.2   | 18.8%        | - 7 028.8  | 18.4%        |\n| OPERATING PROFIT                             | 5,547.5    | 18.6%        | 6,160.3    | 19.1%        | 7 456.9    | 19.5%        |\n\nGross  profit ,  at  27,683.3  million  euros,  came  out  at  72.4%  of sales, compared with 73.9% in 2021, a difference of 150 basis points.\n\nResearch  &  Innovation  expenses, at  3%  of  sales,  increased by more than +10%.\n\nAdvertising  and  promotion  expenses accounted  for  31.5% of sales, a decrease of 130 basis points.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses , at 18.4% of sales, decreased by 40 basis points.\n\nOverall, operating profit increased by +21.0% to 7,456.9 million euros,  and  amounted  to  19.5%  of  sales,  an  improvement  of 40 basis points.\n\n## The  Zone  posted  strong  growth,  at  +18.6%  like-for-like  and +34.1% based on reported figures.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  recorded  double-digit  growth  in  key  countries  and gained market share.

L'Or\u00e9al's investment policy responds to long-term objectives\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  growing  manufacturing  company  thanks  largely to two types of investments:\n\n- 1. scientific and  manufacturing  investments,  which  are described in several sections (see sections 1.2.8. and 1.2.9.) ; and\n- 2. marketing  investments,  which  are  made  on  an  ongoing basis  and  are  inherent  to  the  Group's  activities  in  the cosmetics  industry.  Indeed,  winning  new  market  share requires  in-depth  and  situation-specific  studies,  as  well  as advertising and promotional expenses attuned not only to the familiarity of brands and their competitive position, but also  to  constant  changes  in  consumers'  aspirations  something that the subsidiaries' sales and marketing teams monitor  constantly.  Lastly,  investments  in  point-of  sale (POS)  advertising  materials  ensure  optimal  presence  for our brands in points of sale.\n\nFor  reasons  relating  to  strategy  and  competition,  L'Or\u00e9al cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future investments.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's investments totalled \u20ac1,343 million, or 3.5% of  its  sales.  This  level  reflects  the  Group's  constant  efforts  to improve  manufacturing  efficiency,  research  and  digital development performance and enhance brand value.\n\nInvestment  commitments  in  2022  can  be  broken  down  as follows : production and the physical supply chain represented approximately 29% of total investments; marketing investments, including moulds, POS  advertising  materials  and  stores accounted  for  34%;  IT  investments  spread  over  all  these categories represented 23% of total investments; research and the head offices in the different countries accounted for the remainder (1) . Despite  their  strategic  nature,  none  of  these investments  taken  individually  is  material  enough  at  Group level to warrant more detailed disclosure.",

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): shared and lasting growth\n\n## Priority to Human Capital\n\nAs  our  founder  Eug\u00e8ne  Schueller  declared  with  conviction: 'a  company  is  not  walls  and  machines  but  people,  people and more people.'\n\nEmployees  are  the  driving  force  behind  the  Group  and  one of  its  major  competitive advantages. They are working to roll out  the  Group's  vision  through  its  portfolio  of  brands, its governance,  its  research  and  innovation,  data  and technology in its transformation.\n\nThe  Group's  human  and  social  project  revolves  around  one vision:  to  offer  its  employees  an  inspiring,  inclusive  and innovative working environment, which places human beings at  the  heart  of  each  of  its  decisions.  This  is  reflected  in particular in developing the individual and  collective performances of its employees and investing in the skills of the future. This also relies on a working environment that promotes engagement  and  collective  performance,  where  growth  is shared with employees.\n\nSocial  innovation  is  at  the  heart  of  this  approach,  with  the Share  &  Care  programme  in  particular, or  the  programmes to transform our working methods (Simplicity 2 or Best of Both, the hybrid working policy).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.\n\nSince  its  very  beginnings,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying the  fundamental  rules  of  a  good  corporate  citizen.  The products  offered  to  consumers  meet  the  highest  quality standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all its subsidiaries.  Social  audits  are  also  conducted  on  the suppliers of the plants and distribution centres.\n\nAs far as its resources allow, each subsidiary takes part in the financing  of  sponsorship  initiatives  in  keeping  with  the  key pillars  of  the  Group's  commitment to philanthropy: Research, women  and  the  environment.  Above  and  beyond  its  solid long-term  economic  performances,  L'Or\u00e9al  seeks  to  be exemplary and sets itself demanding standards in order to limit its environmental footprint. All production centres comply with the  same  rules  aimed  at  reducing  their  environmental footprint.\n\nThe  Group  intends  to  develop  its  activity  with  the  utmost respect for the planet, and to improve its social and economic impact  on  the  life  of  the  people  and  communities  that surround it. It is for this reason that, in 2013, in the context of its Sharing  Beauty  with  All  programme,  and  in  2020  with  the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, L'Or\u00e9al set itself ambitious Sustainable  Development  Goals  that  were  formalised  and structured at a strategic level.\n\n## Focus: sharing growth with employees\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care  programme  is  a  large-scale  social  programme  initiated  in  2013.  It  consists  of  commitments  revolving around four pillars that were updated in 2021 and implemented in all countries: social protection, healthcare, work/life balance and the working environment.\n\n## Health\n\n## Protection\n\nProviding employees and their families with financial support in the event of unexpected life events, by allocating appropriate assistance.\n\n## Balance\n\nEnabling all employees to fully experience milestones in life such as maternity and paternity and demonstrating flexibility in working organisation for a better work/life balance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProviding employees and their relatives with access to a high-quality healthcare system as well as prevention measures, placing greater emphasis on mental and emotional health, in order to create a new global approach to 'personal ecology'.\n\n## Workplace\n\nO/ffering the best working environment thereby enabling employees to work in a pleasant, appropriate and e/ffective way, and, depending on their activity, to meet, share, learn, collaborate, create or concentrate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  the  firm  belief  that  sustainable  development  is  an essential factor for success and durability, L'Or\u00e9al is deploying an  ambitious  corporate  social  responsibility  policy,  which  is shared by its management and teams (see section 4.3.).\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  generation  of  its commitments to sustainable development, under the umbrella of  its  programme  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  with  a  new  set  of particularly  ambitious  targets  for  2030,  in  order  to  cover  all the  impacts  associated  with  the  Group's  value  chain: its  production and distribution sites as well as its supply chains and  the  impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  products  by consumers.  L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future,  which  aims  to  ensure  that the  Group's  business  activities  remain  within  the  planetary boundaries  defined  by  environmental  science,  marks  a  new ambition  for  the  sustainable  development  of  L'Or\u00e9al  with\n\nthe  intention  to  capitalise  on  previous  achievements  :  the commitment from 2009 to reduce the environmental footprint of  factories  and  distribution  centres  by  50%  compared to  2005,  then  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme launched  in  2013  with  sustainable  production,  sustainable innovation,  sustainable  consumption  and  shared  growth targets  for  2020,  which  has  made  sustainable  development one of the Group's key strategic pillars.\n\nIn  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  undertook  to  define  Science-Based Targets (SBT) to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain over the long term, in accordance with the Paris Climate Change Agreements. In December 2017, the SBT initiative validated the Group's proposal : L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on its Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by  25%  in  absolute  value  by  2030,  compared  with  the  2016 baseline.",

        "page_content": "A tailored, agile and responsive organisation\n\n## 1.4. A tailored, agile and responsive organisation\n\nThe Group's organisation responds to a dual challenge: pursuing the strategy which has enabled  L'Or\u00e9al  to  be  successful  over  the  last  110  years  and  at  the  same  time inventing the new L'Or\u00e9al of the future, perfectly matched to an ever-changing world.\n\nFrom an organisational and managerial perspective, L'Or\u00e9al is strategically  centralised  and  operationally  decentralised  with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. This unique model empowers its in-country teams and guarantees flexibility and excellence on the  ground.  This  organisational  structure  is  perfectly  suited to  the  current  environment.  During  the  2020  crisis,  it  was  a considerable asset in terms of putting in place measures that were tailored to the specific circumstances in each country.\n\nThe  Group  completed  in  2021  the  reorganisation  of  Zones  it had  announced  in  November  2020,  aligning  them  more closely with consumers.\n\n## 1.4.1. L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  is  a  French  company,  with  its  head  office  in France. It performs a domestic sales activity in France and an export sales activity in its operating territory. At the same time, L'Or\u00e9al S.A. also acts as the holding company and provides on the  one  hand  strategic  coordination,  and  scientific  and technical coordination for the Group throughout the world on the other hand.\n\nThe  subsidiaries  operate  the  Group's  business  activities  in the  countries  or  region(s)  in  which  they  are  located,  on the  domestic  or  the  export  markets.  To  do  so,  they  define the  development  strategy  specific  to  their  market(s),  make the  most  suitable  choices  in  terms  of  consumer  targets  and distribution  channels,  and  manufacture,  directly  or  indirectly, and market the brands they decide to sell on their market(s).\n\nAlmost all of the subsidiaries are owned by L'Or\u00e9al S.A., which has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100% (1) . The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to the consolidated and parent company financial statements.\n\n## 1.4.2. Operational Divisions\n\nThe  Group's  business  activities  are  organised  into  four Operational  Divisions.  In  the  markets,  each  of  these  Divisions develops  and  enhances  its  brand  portfolio  with  consumers (see section 1.2.3.).\n\nBy  establishing  the  Group-wide  multi-division  Travel  Retail Department, the Group has given itself the resources to grow this  influential  segment  using  a  global shopper  strategy: a bespoke approach designed, at the destinations favoured by each nationality, to personalise the experience on the basis of the language, culture and beauty rituals of travellers.\n\n## 1.4.3. Geographic zones\n\nThe  Group's  international  development  led  L'Or\u00e9al,  from 1  January  2021,  to  change  its  organisation  to  give  more coherence  to  each  Zone,  particularly  in  terms  of  consumer behaviour and market maturity, in order to create the conditions for  a  cross-functional  transformation  of  the  organisation  and maximise growth.\n\nThe  geographic  Zones,  each  of  which  has  operational responsibility for the subsidiaries in their country, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Europe Zone comprises Western and Eastern Europe;\n- \u00b7 North America Zone;\n- \u00b7 North Asia Zone brings together mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea;\n- \u00b7 SAPMENA - SSA Zone incorporates South Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa; and\n- \u00b7 Latin America Zone.\n\n## 1.4.4. Functional Divisions\n\nSeveral specialist corporate departments provide their expertise and support to the Operational Divisions, to subsidiaries in their markets and to the other business activities (see section 1.2.2.).",

Internal Control and risk management system\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  constantly  changing  environment. Like  any  company,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  necessarily  exposed  to  risks which,  if  they  were  to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative impact  on  its  business  activities,  its  financial  position  and  its assets, particularly in terms of reputation and image.\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different areas of activity.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  risk  management  consists  of  identifying,  assessing and controlling risks that may affect the smooth running of the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  the  purpose  of  the  Internal  Control system is to enable the Group's manufacturing and economic development  to  take  place  in  a  steady  and  sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses.\n\nInternal Control is a system that applies to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nThe control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control system,  good  risk  management  and  the  application  of procedures, is based on behaviour, the organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment communicated by senior management and in line with the Group's strategic choices.\n\nRisk management and Internal Control is everyone's business, from the governance bodies to all employees.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  system  is  the  subject  of  ongoing supervision in order to verify whether it is relevant and meets the Group's objectives and addresses its issues.\n\nChapter  3  provides  detailed  information  on  identifying  and managing  the  most  significant  risks  from  the  point  of  view of  investment  decision-making,  within  the  meaning  of  the regulations. These risks are listed in the table below.\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with  the  laws  and  regulations  in  force  and  the  Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n\n## Major risks to which the Group believes it is exposed\n\n|                                    |                                                                            | Residual  importance   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Business risks                     | Sanitary crisis*                                                           |                        |\n|                                    | Information and cybersecurity systems*                                     |                        |\n|                                    | Geographic presence and economic and political environment*                |                        |\n|                                    | Crisis management                                                          |                        |\n|                                    | Data                                                                       |                        |\n|                                    | Market and Innovation                                                      |                        |\n|                                    | Business ethics                                                            |                        |\n|                                    | Evolution of sales channels                                                |                        |\n|                                    | Human Resources risk                                                       |                        |\n|                                    | Product quality and safety                                                 |                        |\n|                                    | Safety of people and property                                              |                        |\n| Industrial and environmental risks | Product availability*                                                      |                        |\n|                                    | Climate change                                                             |                        |\n|                                    | Environment and safety                                                     |                        |\n| Legal and regulatory risks         | Risk of non-conformity*                                                    |                        |\n|                                    | Intellectual property: trademarks, designs & models, domain names, patents |                        |\n|                                    | Product claims                                                             |                        |\n| Financial and market risks         | Inflation and currency risk*                                               |                        |\n|                                    | Risk on financial equity interests                                         |                        |\n|                                    | Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets                       |                        |\n\n*\n\n- Most material risks in each category.\n\nResidual importance: Low\n\nModerate\n\nSignificant\n\n<!-- image -->",

Balance of power within the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.1.2.1. General Management procedures: Separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a method of corporate governance that is suited to its specificities and is part of a constant quest for progress. The procedures for conducting the General Management of L'Or\u00e9al have always been decided in the best interest of the Company  and  with  the  constant  concern  that  the  mode of  governance  chosen  will  make  it  possible  to  optimise  the Group's financial and economic performances and to create the most favourable conditions for its long-term development.\n\nAfter  a  period  of  5  years  (between  2006  and  2011)  during which  the  duties  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors and those of Chief Executive Officer were separated in order to ensure a smooth transition between Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones and  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided in 2011 to merge these positions and to appoint Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors responsible for the Company's  General Management\n\n(Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al),  roles that he held until 30 April 2021. As the Company's Articles of Association  do  not  provide  for  any  exception  to  the  legal retirement  age  of  65  years  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, Mr Jean-Paul Agon was required to hand over his duties as Chief Executive  Officer  before  6  July  2021.  On  the  recommendation of  the  Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors decided to separate the functions from 1 May 2021, appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer, and renew Mr Jean-Paul Agon's mandate as Chairman. The Board reiterated this decision on April 21, 2022 on the occasion of the renewal of Jean-Paul Agon's term as Director.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  joined  L'Or\u00e9al  35  years  ago.  He  held various positions in marketing before being named to General Management  (L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  France,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  World  and L'Or\u00e9al  Mexico).  In  2008,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  appointed  him as  President  -  Professional  Products  and  welcomed  him  to the Executive Committee. In January 2011, he was appointed Chief  Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe,  a  role  that  he  held until  the  end  of  2018.  In  2013,  he  became  President  of  the Selective Divisions (Luxe, Active Cosmetics, Professional Products). He was named Deputy CEO in charge of Divisions in May 2017.",

        "page_content": "This  structure  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  Group's performance, values and commitments, as well as the quality of its governance.\n\nThe Board of Directors and Mr Nicolas Hieronimus benefit from Mr Jean-Paul Agon's successful and recognised experience in both  positions.  The  Board  of  Directors  can  count  on  his expertise  in  matters  of  governance  to  meet  the  growing expectations of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus will provide his expertise in the cosmetics market and his  intimate  knowledge  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  as  well  as  his vision  of  the  future  of  Beauty,  to  implement  the  strategic orientations  of  years  to  come,  take  advantage  of  all  the opportunities  offered  by  a  fast-changing  world,  adapt  the Group and reinvent it in keeping with its values, commitments and purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) to 'Create the beauty that moves the world'.\n\n## 2.1.2.2. Key role of the composition and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## A harmonious composition\n\nThe  balance  of  powers  on  the  Board  of  Directors  principally rests on its coherent and harmonious composition and on the qualities of its Directors.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Board of Directors is made up of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, three Directors (one of whom  is  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Board)  from  the  Bettencourt Meyers family, two Directors (one of whom is Vice-Chairman of the Board) linked to Nestl\u00e9, seven independent Directors and two Directors representing the employees.\n\nThus  50% (1) of  the  Board  are  independent  Directors,  who  are highly committed  and  fully  play  their  role  given  their backgrounds and experience. They all hold responsibilities at the  highest  level  in  major  international  groups,  which  allows them to understand all the dimensions of L'Or\u00e9al's operations, clarify Board discussions and interact effectively with General Management.\n\nAll  Board  members  participate  in  the  discussions  and  are a  driving  force  for  ideas.  The  diversity  and  complementarity of  the  Directors'  experience  and  expertise  (entrepreneurial, financial, non-financial, including CSR and HR/labour relations, industrial, digital etc.) enable them to quickly and thoroughly understand the development issues facing the L'Or\u00e9al Group, the leader in the highly competitive, globalised cosmetics market in which the requirement to innovate and adapt is very high.\n\n## Specialised active and effective Committees of the Board\n\nThe  establishment  of  Board  Committees,  their  composition and  responsibilities  contribute  to  a  good  balance  of  power and are a point of attention for the Board of Directors. In fact, the  Board  has  set  up  specialised  committees  to  help  all Directors  carry  out  their  main  duties  collectively.  The  term  of office,  composition  and  operating  procedures  of  the  Board are  defined  in  its  Internal  Rules,  which  are  published  by  the Board of Directors (see 2.3.3.).\n\nAll Committees have a high number of independent Directors: 60% for the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Remuneration  Committee,  and  50%  for  the  Nominations and  Governance  Committee.  The  Chairman  of  each  of these  Committees  is  independent.  Only  the  Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee,  the  organisation  of  which  is  not regulated,  is  chaired  by  a  non-independent  Director  within the  meaning of the AFEP-MEDEF Code: the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer is not a member of any Committee.\n\nThese  committees  are  completely  free  to  draw  up  their respective  agendas.  They  report  on  their  work  to  the  Board of Directors, whose meetings they prepare and to which they make proposals.\n\nAs  part  of  its  review  of  its  activities  at  the  end  of  2022,  the Board  again  emphasised  the  quality  of  the  work  and recommendations of its Committees, which helped to inform its decisions.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nSince  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  met  in  executive sessions, at one or two meetings per year.\n\nThe  Board  considers  that  these  meetings,  which  are  not attended  by  any  corporate  officers  or  any  employees  of the  Group,  contribute  to  good  governance.  Initially  attended by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  executive  sessions  then continue without him.\n\n## Regular evaluation of the organisation and functioning of the Board\n\nAs  part  of  the  annual  assessment  of  the  way  the  Board operates, each year Directors set themselves new objectives to  improve  the  quality  of  their  organisation.  They  seek to achieve optimum effectiveness and ensure that they have the necessary assets to carry out their duties successfully and with complete freedom to act.\n\n## Attentive prevention of conflicts of interest\n\nThe  Directors  are  required  to  act  in  all  circumstances  in  the interest of the Company and of all its shareholders. Every year, the  Board  of  Directors  assesses  the  situation  of  the  Directors using the conflict of interest prevention process. Each Director has the obligation to report potential conflicts of interest which could concern him/her and, in any event, must abstain from participating in the corresponding debates and deliberations.\n\n## 2.1.2.3. Relationships between the Board and General Management\n\n## Powers and duties of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  stipulate  that  the Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act  in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company, in  compliance  with  the  limits  set  by  the  Board;  however, transactions  of  a  significant  amount  or  falling  outside  the Company's  normal  course  of  business  are  submitted  to  the Board  of  Directors  (see  article  1.2.2.  of  the  Board's  Internal Rules).\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  exercises  these  powers  within  the  limit of  the  Company's  purpose  subject  to  the  powers  expressly granted by French law to Annual General Meetings and the Board of Directors. He represents the Company in its dealings with third parties.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Framework for the implementation of corporate governance principles\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer communicates  completely transparently  with  all  the  Directors  and  keeps  them  regularly informed  of  all  aspects  of  the  Company's  affairs  and  its performances. He is required to provide each Director with all documents  and  information  required  to  perform  their  remit. More  specifically, the Chief Executive  Officer provides the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the Company if the importance or urgency of the information so  requires,  enabling  the  Board  to  manage  with  complete freedom  the  issues  that  concern  it.  This  provision  of  ongoing information also includes any relevant information concerning the  Company,  and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports containing financial analysis. The Chief Executive Officer gives the Board and its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior managers of L'Or\u00e9al within the strict framework of their remits  and  duties.  In  consultation  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  the  Board  and  the  Committees  may  use  external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board provides the General Management with invaluable support  for  strategic  decision-making  through  its  reflections and the impetus it provides.\n\n## Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  stipulate  the  following  duties of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors:  'The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors organises and oversees the Board's work and reports thereon to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth  strategy  and  encourages  and  strengthens,  inter  alia, links  between  the  Company  and  the  main  market  players. The  Chairman  oversees  the  work  of  the  Company's  bodies responsible for corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their  duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board must use his best efforts to promote the  values  and  image  of  the  Company  at  all  times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe is provided with the material resources required to perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care  to  develop  and maintain a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and  the  General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee continuous, ongoing implementation by the General Management of the strategies defined by the Board'.\n\nTaking  into  consideration  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  experience and expertise, as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Group and  the  beauty  market,  the  Board  decided  to  expand  the duties entrusted to the Chairman. In all these specific missions, the  Chairman  acts  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Chief Executive  Officer  who  alone  directs  and  manages  the Company's  operations.  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  as  Chairman  of the Board of Directors, provides his assistance and advice to the Chief Executive Officer, particularly in the implementation of  the  strategic  orientations  of  the  Company  defined  by  the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 he is informed and consulted by the Chief Executive Officer on  all  significant  issues  and  events,  such  as  proposed acquisitions or disposals, major  financial  transactions, financial  communication,  the  guidelines  of  the  Human Resources  policy  and  appointments  of  the  Group's principal  executives,  Ethics  and  issues  of  Corporate  Social Responsibility;\n- \u00b7 he  monitors,  in  collaboration  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer, certain equity interests, including L'Or\u00e9al's stake in Sanofi;\n- \u00b7 in  collaboration  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  he  can represent the Group in its high-level relations, both nationally and  internationally,  including  with  public  authorities,  and L'Or\u00e9al's strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 he ensures respect for L'Or\u00e9al's values and culture;\n- \u00b7 he  can  hear  the  Statutory  Auditors  for  the  preparation of the work of the Board and the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  chairs  and  leads  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  meets  with  the  members  of  the  Board  outside  the presence  of  Directors  belonging  or  reporting  to  General Management;  these  meetings  serve  as  an  opportunity  to discuss  the  performance  and  remuneration  of  executive corporate officers; and\n- \u00b7 he reports to the Board on the performance of his mission.",

Independent Directors\n\n## All  the  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  have  freedom of judgement\n\nThe balance of powers on the Board is ensured through a very precise  definition  and  sharing  of  the  tasks  to  be  carried  out by  everyone.  All  the  Directors  receive  information  on  an ongoing basis and have suitable means for the performance of their duties. They all have a duty of vigilance and participate, in total  independence,  in  the  decisions  and  work  of  the  Board and, where applicable, its Committees. They are all required to comply with the rules in force with regard to conflicts of interest.\n\n## The Directors who qualify as independent under the criteria defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code\n\nA  member  of  the  Board  is  considered  independent  when he/she  does  not  maintain  any  relationship  of  any  kind  with the  Company,  its  Group  or  its  Management  which  could interfere with his/her freedom of judgement. With this in mind, the  criteria  that  guide  the  Board  in  determining  whether a  member  can  qualify  as  independent  are  the  following criteria specified by the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- \u00b7 the member must not be an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company, an employee or executive corporate officer  or  Director  of  a  company  that  is  consolidated  by the Company, or an employee or executive corporate officer or Director of its parent  company  or  of  a  company consolidated by that parent company and must not have held any of these positions during the previous five years;\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  be  an  executive  corporate  officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds  the  office  of  Director  or  in  which  an  employee designated as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (either currently or having performed such duties within the last five years) holds an office as Director;\n- \u00b7 the member must not be a customer, supplier, investment banker,  financial  banker,  or  advisor  significant  to  the Company  or  its  Group,  or  for  whom  the  Company  or  its Group represents a significant proportion of business;\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  any  close  family  ties  to  a director or corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 the member must not have been the Company's Statutory Auditor over the previous five years; and\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  been  a  Director  of  the Company for more than twelve years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business relationships refer to  the  financial  flows  that  took  place  during  financial  year  2022  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  companies  in  which  the  Directors who qualify as independent also hold an office or position. As to the significance of the business relationship, and in keeping with  French  Financial  Markets  Authority  -  AMF  recommendations,  the  Board  of  Directors  carried  out  a  quantitative  and qualitative analysis, adopting a wide multi-criteria approach (duration and continuity, importance of the business relationship for L'Or\u00e9al and the Director, and organisation of the relationship). Following this analysis, the Board concluded there was no significant business relationships.\n\nIn  summary,  on  31  December  2022,  seven  members  of  the Board  of  Directors  out  of  14  (excluding  the  Directors representing the employees) qualify as independent ( i.e. 50% of the Board of Directors). It is specified that the following are not  considered  to  be  independent:  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon (former  executive  corporate  officer  for  less  than  five  years and  Director  since  2006);  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  (executive corporate officer); Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers (Bettencourt Meyers family  holding  34.70%  of  the  share  capital);  Mr  Paul  Bulcke and  Ms  B\u00e9atrice  Guillaume-Grabisch  (Nestl\u00e9  holding  20.11% of the share capital).\n\n## 2.2.1.5. Responsible Directors\n\nWithin the scope of French law and the rights and obligations of  the  Directors  as  defined  in  the  Internal  Rules  of  the Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  and  in  accordance  with  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Directors  are  subject  to  compliance  with the rules in force with regard to conflicts of interest and stock market  ethics  upon  their  appointment  as  a  Director  and throughout their term of office.\n\n## Selection of responsible Directors\n\nDirectors are appointed, subject to approval from the Annual General  Meeting,  following  a  selection  process.  This  process determines  the  Director  profiles  required  by  the  Company  in terms  of  skills,  qualifications  and  experience  needed  to complement those of the Directors already appointed. Issues such as candidates' availability, numbers of directorships held and independence are also considered (see section 2.2.1.2.). Particular  attention  is  also  paid  to  directorships  held  in  other companies;  Directors  are  required  to  devote  the  necessary time and attention to their duties and limit the number of their directorships  to  ensure  their  availability  (article  3.3.  of  the Internal Rules of the Board).\n\nWhen  joining  the  Board  of  Directors,  each  Director  receives a  copy  of  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  and  the  Articles of  Association  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  Stock  Market  Ethics  Code, the  Code  of  Ethics  etc.  These  codes  adopted  by  the\n\nCompany serve as a frame of reference for Directors in terms of  the  standards  required  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  this  area.  As  soon as they take up their office, Directors will also receive support in the  form  of  dedicated  meetings  with,  in  particular, the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, the  Secretary  of  the  Board  and  the  Chairman  of  the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nMembers  of  the  Board  of  Directors  require  the  necessary objectivity to make an independent judgement on the conduct of the Company's business. The balance of powers established within  the  Board  allows  its  members  to  exercise  independent judgement. The Board is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  directly  contributes  to the  work,  discussions  and,  ultimately,  the  decisions  taken by the Board;\n- \u00b7 the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  who  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  an  ongoing  relationship  of trust  between  the  Board  and  the  General  Management, particularly in view of his expertise in matters of governance and the  quality  of  his  discussions  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  based  on  a  relationship  of  trust  established  over the course of many years;\n- \u00b7 Directors  from  major  shareholders  that  have  a  specific interest in the long-term performance of the Company;\n- \u00b7 seven  independent  Directors  with  experience  as  senior managers of large international groups, whose independence of  thought,  sense  of  perspective  and  freedom  of  speech enable  them  to  challenge  and  support  the  General Management in defining the Group's strategy; and\n- \u00b7 two  Directors  representing  the  employees,  who  have extensive knowledge of the Company (section 2.2.1.3.).\n\n## Responsible exercise of office\n\nTo maintain a high standard, the Board of Directors, based on the  work  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee, shall ensure that, throughout their term of office, Directors are able to act in the best interests of the Company, with all the due  diligence  and  care  required  and  subject  to  a  strict confidentiality and loyalty obligation.",

They  are  required  to  notify  the  Board  of  any  situation  that may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such  conflict  is only  potential,  and  must  refrain  from  participating  in  the corresponding deliberations.\n\nIn  addition,  each  year  all  Directors  must  issue  a  declaration relating to potential conflicts of interest between their duties to L'Or\u00e9al  and  their  private  or  professional  interests,  specifically with  regard  to  other  directorships  and  roles.  Any  relevant information disclosed in this way is made public. Based  on  these  declarations,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  not identified any  conflict  of  interests on  the  date  these declarations  were  issued  pursuant  to  Delegated  European Regulation No. 2019/980 supplementing Regulation No. 2017/ 1129, known as 'Prospectus 3'.\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  conducts  an annual  review  of  the  summary  table  prepared  by  the Company  of  the  financial  flows  that  occurred  during  the financial  year  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  interested  parties  as defined  by  regulations  in  order  to  report  to  the  Board  of Directors as part of the regular procedure to evaluate current agreements signed under normal terms pursuant to Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code. In case of doubts  about  the  classification  of  an  agreement,  the Committee  must  verify  that  the  transactions  have  been concluded  in  ordinary  course  of  business  and  under  normal conditions, so that the Board of Directors can implement the procedure  for  related-party  agreements  when  necessary. In  this  case,  the  persons  directly  or  indirectly  interested  in this agreement  do  not  participate  in  the  assessment. In accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the recommendations of the French Financial Markets Authority AMF, the Board of Directors, based on the work carried out by the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  also  analyses each year any possible business relationships between L'Or\u00e9al and  companies  in  which  independent  Directors  hold directorships or perform functions, to ensure these relationships are not significant (see section 2.2.1.4.).\n\n## Information relating to directors and corporate officers pursuant to Annex 1 of Delegated European Regulation No. 2019/980\n\nFamily relationship between directors and corporate officers (Article 12.1 of the Annex)\n\nMs Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers is the mother of Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers.\n\n## Absence of any conviction or incrimination of the directors and corporate officers (Article 12.1 of the Annex)\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  over  the  last  five  years, the directors and corporate officers have not been convicted for  fraud,  associated  with  a  bankruptcy,  receivership  or liquidation,  or  the  subject  of  any  official  public  incrimination or  sanction  imposed  by  statutory  or  regulatory  authorities (including  designated  professional  bodies)  or  a  decision by  a  court  disqualifying  them  from  acting  as  a  member of  an  administrative,  management  or  supervisory  body  or from  acting  in  the  management  or  conduct  of  the  business of any issuer.\n\n## Potential conflicts of interest between the duties of the directors and corporate officers with regard to L'Or\u00e9al, and their private interests and/or other duties (Articles 12.2 and 16.3 of the Annex)\n\nThe method of organisation and modus operandi adopted by the  Board  would  allow  it,  where  applicable,  to  prevent  any abusive  exercise  of  their  rights  by  one  or  more  shareholders that  come  to  control  the  Company,  notably  due  to  the presence  of  seven  independent  Directors  on  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nRegarding any arrangement or agreement entered into with the  major  shareholders,  customers,  suppliers,  or  others,  under which a Director was selected as a member of the Board of Directors,  an  agreement  between  the  Bettencourt  Meyers family  and  Nestl\u00e9  S.A.,  which  expired  on  21  March  2018, concerned the reciprocal voting commitment in favour of the appointment as Directors of three members proposed by the Bettencourt  Meyers  family  and  two  members  proposed  by Nestl\u00e9.\n\nThe Company was informed of the participation, amounting to 100  shares,  of  its  Chairman,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  the collective  lock-up  agreements  signed  on  16  December  2016 by T\u00e9thys SAS and members of the Bettencourt Meyers family group under the Dutreil law. The Nominations and Governance  Committee  Meeting  of  6  December  2016 examined  this arrangement  prior to signature of the agreement and considered that it could not be contested on the  basis  of  the  Company's  interests,  nor  could  it  lead  to consequences for the Company's governance, and informed the Board of Directors accordingly.\n\n## Information on service contracts with members of the administrative bodies (Article 12.2 of the Annex)\n\nNo directors or corporate officers have a service contract with L'Or\u00e9al  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  providing  for  the  granting of benefits upon termination of such contract.\n\n## Stock market ethics\n\nThe  Board  noted  the  rules  to  be  applied  to  prevent  insider trading, in particular those resulting from European Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on Market Abuse which became applicable on  3  July  2016,  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French Financial  Markets  Authority  -  AMF,  in  particular  regarding  the periods  during  which  it  is  prohibited  from  trading  in  shares. It decided to amend its Internal Rules accordingly.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  legal  provisions,  regulations  and  market recommendations, L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Ethics Code points out that inside information must only be passed on and used for professional purposes.\n\nInside information is information of a precise nature, which has not  been  made  public  and  which,  if  it  were  made  public, would likely to have a significant effect on the share price.\n\nThe  Stock  Market  Code  of  Ethics  restates  the  ban  on  any person  in  possession  of  insider  information  from  executing or ordering the execution of financial transactions on L'Or\u00e9al shares, and emphasises that any misconduct in this area may result  in  criminal  proceedings. The Internal Rules of the Board specifically  ask  Directors  to  refrain  from  trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al shares precisely in certain periods and when they have access to inside information.\n\nLastly,  Directors  are  required  to  notify  the  AMF  of  each transaction  carried  out  by  them  or  by  persons  closely associated with them related to L'Or\u00e9al shares. This obligation is  periodically  restated  by  the  Company  (see  summary  of these operations in section 2.6.).",

Changes in corporate offices and directorships of Directors\n\n## Changes in 2022\n\nRenewal of the term of office of three Directors: Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Mr Patrice Caine and Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Director\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022  renewed Mr Jean-Paul Agon's tenure as Director for a four-year term. The  Board  of  Directors  can  count  on  his  commitment, experience  and  skills,  as  well  as  his  expertise  in  matters of  governance,  to  meet  the  growing  expectations  of stakeholders.  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  has  been  committed  to the  success  and  reputation  of  the  company  for  over 40  years.  His  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  company,  its environment  and  the  beauty  market  represent  a  major asset for the Board in their discussions and decisions relating to  the  definition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  and  the  monitoring the  implementation  thereof.  Mr  Agon  is  also  deeply committed to the values of L'Or\u00e9al and the embedding of its culture.\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Mr Patrice Caine as Director\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022  renewed Mr  Patrice  Caine's  tenure  as  Director  for  a  four-year term.  The  Board  benefits  from  Mr  Caine's  expertise  in  the area  of  governance,  his  experience  as  an  executive  in  a leading  international  company,  his  strategic  vision,  his industrial  expertise,  as  well  as  an  in-depth  knowledge  of new technologies and cyber security.\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo as Director\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022  renewed Ms  Bel\u00e9n  Garijo's  tenure  as  Director  for  a  four-year  term. The Board benefits from her experience as a director of a large  international  group.  Her  scientific  skills  and  expertise in  research  and  innovation  acquired  during  a  career  in the  pharmaceutical  industry  represent  valuable  assets  for the Board.\n\n## Changes in 2023\n\nRenewal of the term of office of two Directors: Ms Sophie Bellon and Ms Fabienne Dulac\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Ms Sophie Bellon as Director\n\nAs the term of office of Ms Sophie Bellon as Director is set to expire,  the  renewal  of  her  term  of  office  for  four  years  is submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nMs Sophie Bellon is Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of the  Sodexo  group,  and  has  held  various  positions  within  this group for more than 20 years.\n\nSodexo, a global leader in quality-of-life services, is located in 53 countries and has 422,000 employees worldwide.\n\nMs  Sophie  Bellon  has  been  a  Director  of  L'Or\u00e9al  since  2015. She is Chairwoman of the Human Resources and Remuneration  Committee.  Ms  Sophie  Bellon  will  chair  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  until  the  close  of the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2023: Mr Patrice Caine will  replace  her  at  the  head  of  this  Committee, of which she will  remain  a  member.  She  was  also  a  member  of  the  Audit Committee until April 2022.\n\nMs  Bellon  is  an  independent  director  who  is  highly  involved in  the  work  of  the  Committees  and  who  brings  to  the  Board her  interdisciplinary  business  knowledge,  her  international experience,  her  expertise  in  governance  issues,  her  strategic vision and her commitment to social and societal responsibility.\n\nOver the four years of her tenure as Director, her attendance rate  has  been  100%  for  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors and 98% for committee meetings.\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Ms Fabienne Dulac as Director\n\nAs the term of office of Ms Fabienne Dulac as Director is set to expire,  the  renewal  of  her  term  of  office  for  four  years  is submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nMs Dulac is Chief Transformation Officer of the Orange Group from  April  2023  and  is  a  member  of  its  Executive  Committee since  2015.  She  joined  this  group  in  1997  and  held  various positions in marketing, business development, communication and  digital,  before  serving  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Orange France from 2015 to April 2023. She is  responsible for the implementation of the Orange Group's major transformation projects. She is also a Director of La Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux.\n\nFabienne  Dulac  has  been  a  Director  of  L'Or\u00e9al  since  2019. She is a member of two committees: the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nShe  exercises  her  office  as  independent  director  with  great commitment and great freedom of judgement. Her contribution  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  includes  her knowledge  of  the  digital  industry,  consumers  and  customer relationships,  her  expertise  in  Human  Resources  and  her experience in leading a highly transformational organisation.\n\nOver the four years of her tenure as Director, her attendance rate  has  been  88%  for  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors and 84% for committee meetings.\n\nIf  the  Meeting  approves  the  resolutions  concerning  the  two proposed  renewals  of  term  of  office,  then  the  composition of  the  Board  of  Directors  will  remain  unchanged.  The  Board of Directors will then be composed of 16 members: 14 Directors elected  by  the  Meeting  and  two  directors  representing  the employees.\n\nThe  balances  of  independence  and  gender  will  remain unchanged:\n\n- \u00b7 7 independent Directors out of 14 Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting, i.e. 50%; and\n- \u00b7 7  women  and  7  men  out  of  14  Directors  elected  by  the General Meeting, i.e. a parity of 50%.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3. Organisation and modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.3.1. General information on the meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees in 2022\n\nThe Board met 7 times in 2022.\n\nFour Committees prepare for the discussions and deliberations by the Board. 19 meetings were held in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 6 meetings of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 5 meetings of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 4 meetings of the Nominations and Governance Committee; and\n- \u00b7 4  meetings  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee.\n\nDirectors  may  independently  propose  any  subject  that  is appropriate  for  good  governance  to  be  included  on  the agenda for  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  L'Or\u00e9al's Directors are regularly informed of all the Company's activities and its  performances in a highly competitive universe. Board meetings  are  generally  held  in  the  presence  of  senior managers of the Company invited to attend on the basis of topical  developments  at  L'Or\u00e9al  and  many  aspects  of  its strategy.  In  an  open,  constructive  dialogue,  exchanges  of views, in confidence, contribute to the quality of the Directors' work.  Board  discussions,  encouraged  by  the  Chairman,  take place transparently and in great detail.\n\n## Executive sessions:\n\nDirectors meet at least once a year without the presence of the executive corporate officer, Directors representing employees  or  any  other  Group  employee  (Article  4.2  of  the Internal Rules). An executive session was held on 7 December 2022. The Chairman of the Board attended initially, after which he withdrew and the executive session continued without him. The Audit Committee also meets twice a year in the presence of Statutory Auditors and in the absence of any representative from  Management,  at  the  end  of  the  meetings  dedicated to  reviewing  the  annual  and  interim  financial  statements. These two meetings were held on 9 February and 28 July 2022.\n\n## Attendance rate\n\nThe  preparation  and  holding  of  Board  and  Committee meetings requires significant availability and investment by the Directors. In 2022, the attendance rate at Board meetings was 97.5%  on  average.  The  individual  attendance  rate  at  Board and Committee meetings is specified below. The allocation of Directors'  fees,  based  on  the  rate  of  attendance  by  each member  at  Board  meetings  and  meetings  of  the  various Committees, is described in section 2.4.\n\n## Individual attendance rates of Directors in 2022 at Board and Committee meetings\n\n|                                          | Board of Directors   | Strategy and Sustainability   | Audit      | Nominations and Governance   | Human Resources and Remuneration   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 7 meetings           | 6 meetings                    | 5 meetings | 4 meetings                   | 4 meetings                         |\n| Mr Jean-Paul Agon                        | 100%                 | 100%                          |            |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Nicolas Hieronimus                    | 100%                 |                               |            |                              |                                    |\n| Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers          | 100%                 | 100%                          |            | 100%                         | 100%                               |\n| Mr Paul Bulcke                           | 100%                 | 100%                          |            | 100%                         | 100%                               |\n| Ms Sophie Bellon                         | 100%                 |                               | 100%**     | 100%                         | 100%                               |\n| Mr Patrice Caine                         | 100%                 | 100%                          |            | 100%                         |                                    |\n| Ms Fabienne Dulac                        | 71%                  |                               | 80%        |                              | 100%                               |\n| Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo                          | 86%                  |                               |            |                              | 50%                                |\n| Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch           | 100%                 |                               | 100%       |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Thierry Hamel (from 21 April 2022)    | 100%                 |                               |            |                              |                                    |\n| Ms Ilham Kadri                           | 100%                 |                               | 75%*       |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Jean-Victor Meyers                    | 100%                 | 100%                          |            |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Nicolas Meyers                        | 100%                 |                               | 100%       |                              |                                    |\n| Ms Virginie Morgon                       | 100%                 |                               | 100%       |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Alexandre Ricard                      | 100%                 | 100%*                         |            |                              |                                    |\n| Mr Benny de Vlieger (from 21 April 2022) | 100%                 |                               |            |                              |                                    |\n| 2022 AVERAGE                             | 97.5%                | 100%                          | 93.5%      | 100%                         | 91.5%                              |\n\n- * Director who joined this Committee in 2022.\n- ** Director who left this Committee in 2022.",

Activities of the Board of Directors\n\nEvery year, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors determines L'Or\u00e9al's strategic directions, which integrate the challenges of climate change  and,  more  generally,  the  issues  of  sustainable development, ethics and the sense of purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) to  'Create  the  Beauty  that  moves  the  world'.  The  Board ensures these strategic directions are implemented, in  accordance  with  its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social and  environmental  challenges  of  its  business  activity  into consideration.\n\nThe  economic  and  financial  positionn  and  the  cash  position are reviewed at least twice a year at a Board meeting, when the annual financial statements are approved and when the interim financial statements are reviewed, or at any other time if necessary.\n\nEach of the four Consultative Committees set up by the Board of  Directors  to  work  on  topics  falling  within  their  field  of expertise  is  involved  in  determining  and  monitoring  the strategy.  The  Committees'  work  systematically  gives  rise  to  a report  presented  by  their  Chairman/Chairwoman  at  Board meetings.\n\nThe work of the Board of Directors is based on Internal Rules, reproduced  in  full  in  this  document  and  also  available  on loreal-finance.com.

The  latest  updates  to  the Internal Rules were made on 9 February and 13 October 2022. These  updates  involved  changing  the  minimum  number  of shares  that  must  be  held  by  Directors  and  incorporating the  updated  'Code  of  Conduct  for  the  provision  of  services that may be entrusted to the Statutory Auditors of the L'Or\u00e9al Group and to their networks'.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors,  the  rules  it applies to its work, its modus operandi, and the work that it has carried out in the year, evaluated on an annual basis by the Directors, as well as the decisions made, are described in more detail in sections 2.2. and 2.3.\n\n## The Board's work in 2022\n\nNumber of meetings\n\n| Composition   | Independence  \u25c6   |   in 2022 | Attendance rate   |   Board Committees |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| 16 Directors  | 50%               |         7 | 97.5%             |                  4 |\n\nThe work and agendas were prepared so as to cover all of the subjects within the Board's remit and to meet the expectations expressed by the Directors in the annual evaluation of the modus operandi of the Board.\n\nThe Board of Directors is consistently informed of the work of the various Committees by each Chairman and bases its decisions on their recommendations.\n\n## 2022 main activities\n\n## Corporate governance\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed renewal of the terms of office of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Mr Patrice Caine and Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo to be submitted to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022;\n- \u00b7 Welcome of two new Directors representing the employees: Mr Thierry Hamel and Mr Benny de Vlieger.\n\n## Composition of the Committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the composition of the Committees: Ms Ilham Kadri joined the Audit Committee, replacing Ms Sophie Bellon and Mr Alexandre Ricard joined the Strategy and Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Extension of the separation of offices:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewal of Mr Jean-Paul Agon's term of office as Chairman of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.",

The  Internal  Rules  specify  the  modus  operandi  of  the Board,  in  the  interests  of  the  Company  and  of  all  its\n\n## PREAMBLE\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  ('the  Company')  is  a collegial  body  which is  mandated by all the shareholders. It has  the  authority  given  to  it  by  law  to  act  in  all circumstances in the best interests of the Company.\n\nBy  exercising  its  legal  prerogatives,  the  Board  of  Directors ('the Board') fulfils the following main duties: it validates the Company's  strategic  orientations,  appoints  the  corporate officers  given  responsibility  for  managing  the  Company within  the  scope  of  this  strategy,  chooses  the  method of  organisation  of  General  Management  (combination or separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer),  oversees  management  and  ensures  the  quality of  the  financial  and  non-financial  information  provided  to the shareholders and to the markets.\n\nThe organisation of the Board's work and its composition is adapted  to  the  specificities  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  is  in  line  with an  approach  of  constant  progress.  The  Board's  main responsibility  is  to  adopt  the  method  of  organisation  and the modus operandi which enable it to perform its duties to the best of its  ability.  Its  organisation  and  modus  operandi are described in these Internal Rules which it draws up, and which are published in full on L'Or\u00e9al's website and in the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Board's actions are carried out within the framework of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The Corporate Governance Report provides more detail on the Board's composition and on the way  in  which  the  Board's  work  is  prepared  and  organised, and  explains,  where  applicable,  the  recommendations that  have  not  been  adopted  in  light  of  the  Company's specificities.\n\nThese  Rules  apply  to  all  the  Directors,  both  current  and future, whether they are appointed by the Annual General Meeting or the employees, and are intended to complement  the  legal,  regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and those  under  the  Articles  of  Association  in  order  to  state accurately  the  modus  operandi  of  the  Board  of  Directors and its committees.\n\nshareholders,  and  those  of  its  Committees,  whose  members are Directors to whom it gives preparatory assignments for its work. The latest updates to the Internal Rules were made on 9  February  and  13  October  2022.  These  updates  involved changing the minimum number of shares that must be held by Directors  and  incorporating  the  updated  'Code  of  Conduct for  the  provision  of  services  that  may  be  entrusted  to  the Statutory Auditors of the L'Or\u00e9al Group and to their networks'. As  was  the  case  for  previous  versions,  the  Internal  Rules  are made public in full in this section.\n\n## 1. Remit and authority of the Board of Directors\n\n## 1.1. General powers of the Board\n\nThe  Board  defines  the  business  strategy  of  the  Company and  monitors  its  implementation,  in  accordance  with  its corporate interest, taking social and environmental challenges into consideration.\n\nSubject  to  the  powers  expressly  conferred  to  Annual General  Meetings  and  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose,  the  Board  deals  with  all  matters  regarding  the smooth  running  of  the  Company  and  settles  issues concerning the Company by virtue of its decisions. At any time  in  the  year,  the  Board  carries  out  the  controls  and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nThe  Board  ensures,  as  appropriate,  that  a  mechanism for the  prevention  and  detection  of  corruption  and influence-peddling is in place.\n\nThe Board also ensures that the executive corporate officers implement  a  policy  of  non-discrimination  and  diversity  as regards the balance of women and men in management bodies.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  relays  the  Board's activity.\n\nThe  Board  prepares  for  and  convenes  Annual  General Meetings and sets the agenda. It puts the parent company and  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the  vote  and presents  to  the  meeting  its  Management  Report  to  which the Corporate Governance Report is appended.\n\nThe Board sets the remuneration of directors and corporate officers. It reports  on  its  policy  and  decisions  in  its Management  Report  and  in  the  Corporate  Governance Report. The Annual General Meeting is consulted every year on  the  components  of  remuneration  due  or  allocated  to each executive corporate officer for the past financial year. The  Board  is  a  collegial  body  which  is  legally  unable  to delegate its authority, except to the General Management in  those  cases  expressly  provided  for  by  law.  Within  the scope  of  its  work,  it  may  decide  to  set  up  Committees which  do  not  have  decision-making  powers  but  have  the task  of  providing  all  useful  information  for  the  discussions and decisions  which  it  is  called  upon  to  make.  The  Board decides  on  the  composition  of  the  Committees  and  the rules with regard to their modus operandi.\n\nThe  Board  may  ask  one  or  more  of  its  members  or  third parties  to  carry  out  special  assignments  or  projects  aimed in particular at studying one of more specific topics.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2. Relations between General Management and the Board\n\n## 1.2.1. Forms of General Management\n\nGeneral  Management  of  the  Company  is  carried  out, under the responsibility of either the Chairman of the Board of  Directors  (the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer) or by another individual with the position of Chief Executive Officer.  Leaving  the  possibility  to  choose  between  the separation  or  combination  of  roles,  French  law  does  not give preference to any form and gives the Board authority to  choose  between  the  two  methods  of  organisation  of the  General  Management  considering  the  specificities  of the Company.\n\nWhether  the  General  Management  is  carried  out  by  a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a Chief Executive Officer,  the  Board  has  the  same  prerogatives.  It  may  in particular take all specific measures aimed at ensuring the continued balance of powers.\n\n## 1.2.2. Powers of General Management\n\nThe  General  Management,  which  may  be  carried  out  by the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  by  a  Chief Executive Officer, is vested with the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  It  must exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose subject to the powers expressly granted by French law  to  General  Shareholders'  Meetings  and  the  Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board has the possibility to provide for limitations on the powers  of  the  General  Management.  Thus,  transactions which  may  materially  impact  the  scope  of  consolidation of  the  Company,  in  particular,  transactions  involving  an amount in excess of \u20ac250,000,000 and all new transactions which  are  outside  the  normal  course  of  business  for  an amount in excess of \u20ac50,000,000, must be submitted to the Board.  In  any  event,  the  Board  of  Directors  must  be informed  of  the  conclusion  and  implementation  of  all transactions.\n\nThe  General  Management  represents  the  Company  in  its dealings with third parties.\n\nUpon a proposal by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board may  appoint  one  or  more  individuals  responsible  for assisting  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  will  hold  the corporate office of Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s).\n\n## 1.2.3. Duties of General Management\n\nWhatever the form of organisation chosen (Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Chief  Executive  Officer),  the General Management is required to provide each Director with  all  the  documents  and  information  required  to  carry out their duties.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  General  Management  provides  the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the  Company  if  the  importance  or  urgency  of  the information so requires. This provision of ongoing information also  includes  any  relevant  information  concerning  the Company,  and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports containing financial analysis.\n\nThe  General  Management  gives  the  Board  and  its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior managers of  L'Or\u00e9al  within  the  strict  framework  of  their  remits  and duties.  In  consultation  with  the  General  Management,  the Board  and  the  Committees  may  use  external  consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board is informed, at the time of closing of the annual financial statements and the review of the interim financial statements  or  at  any  other  time  if  necessary,  of  the Company's financial position and cash position.\n\n## 2. Composition of the Board\n\n## 2.1. Directors\n\nThe Directors of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 provide their expertise and professional experience;\n- \u00b7 are  required  to  act  with  due  care  and  attention  and participate  actively  in  the  work  and  discussions  of the Board;\n- \u00b7 have complete freedom of judgement.\n\nThis  freedom  of  judgement  enables  them  in  particular  to participate, in total independence, in the decisions and work of the Board, and, where appropriate, of its Committees.\n\n## 2.1.1. Independence\n\nThe  Board  reviews  the  independence  of  each  of  its members  every  year,  after  obtaining  the  opinion  of  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  in  particular  in light of the independence criteria in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  taking  account  of  the  specific  needs  of  L'Or\u00e9al. The  findings  of  this  evaluation  are  reported  to  the shareholders and made available to the general public.\n\n## 2.1.2. Diversity\n\nThe Board considers the issue of the desirable balance of its composition  and  that  of  its  Committees,  notably  in  the representation of men and women, nationalities and diversity of  skills.  The  objectives,  terms  and  conditions,  and  results  of its  policy  in  this  area  are  made  public  in  the  Corporate Governance  Report  and  included  in  the  Registration Document.\n\n## 2.1.3. Terms of office\n\nThe  length  of  the  term  of  office  of  Directors  is  four  years. However, the staggering of the terms of office is organised in order to avoid renewing too many Directors at once and favour renewing Directors harmoniously.\n\nIn  principle,  it  is  agreed  by  the  Board  members  that  all Directors  will  tender  their  resignation  to  the  Board  prior  to the  Annual  General  Meeting  following  their  73rd  birthday and that they will no longer apply for renewal of their term of  office  if  this  rule  does  not  enable  them  to  perform  their office for at least two years.\n\nIn  any  event,  in  accordance  with  French  law  and  the Articles  of  Association,  the  total  number  of  Directors  who are over 70 years of age may not exceed one third of the Directors in office.",

Chairman of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors must elect a Chairman from among its members.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  organises  and  oversees  the Board's  work  and  reports  thereon  to  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman  is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe Chairman oversees the work of the Company's bodies responsible for corporate governance and ensures, in  particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any document  or  information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board of Directors in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote  the  values  and  image  of  the  Company  at  all times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe  is  provided  with  the  material  resources  required  to perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care,  particularly  in  the event  of  separation  of  roles,  to  develop  and  maintain  a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and the General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee  continuous, ongoing  implementation  by  the  General  Management  of the strategies defined by the Board.\n\n## 3. Rights and obligations of the Directors\n\n## 3.1. Knowledge of and compliance with regulatory texts, recommendations and obligations\n\nEach of the members of the Board declares that they have read the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company's Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 the  legal  and  regulatory  texts  that  govern  French 'soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  anonymes'  (public  limited  companies)  within the framework of the functioning of a Board of Directors and, in particular, the rules relating to:\n- \u00b7 the number of offices that may be held simultaneously;\n- \u00b7 the agreements and transactions concluded between the Director and the Company;\n- \u00b7 the definition of the powers of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the  holding  and  use  of  inside  information,  which  are discussed in section 4.6.;\n- \u00b7 the recommendations defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 and the provisions of these Rules.\n\n## 3.2. Respect for the interests of the Company\n\nThe Directors are required to act in all circumstances in the interest of the Company and all its shareholders.\n\nThe Directors are obliged to notify the Board of any situation that  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such conflict is only potential, and must refrain from participating in the corresponding deliberations.\n\nThe Directors must inform the Board every year of the offices and  positions  they  hold  in  other  companies  and  of  any conflicts of interest, even if they are only potential, that they have  identified  (see  Annual  Report  on  independence under Article 4.4).\n\nThe Board furthermore discusses every year the assessment of  whether  or  not  the  business  relationships  maintained between  the  companies  in  which  the  Directors  hold  their offices  and  the  Company  are  significant.  It  reports  on  its evaluation in the Registration Document.\n\n## 3.3. Obligations of due diligence and provision of information\n\nThe Director must devote the necessary time and attention to his/her duties.\n\nHe/she must limit the number of offices held so as to ensure his/her availability.\n\nA  Director  must  not  hold  more  than  four  other  terms  of office  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign companies. The Director concerned is given enough time to bring his/her situation into compliance with this rule, where required.\n\nThe  Director  must  keep  the  Board  informed  of  the  terms of office held  in  other  companies,  including  his/her participation  on  the  Board  Committees  of  such  French or foreign companies.\n\nA corporate officer must not hold more than two offices as Director  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign  companies.  The  Director  must  ask  for  the  Board's opinion before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company.\n\nEach Board member undertakes to be diligent:\n\n- \u00b7 by  attending  all  Board  meetings,  where  necessary bymeans  of  videoconference  or  telecommunication facilities, except in the case of a major impediment;\n- \u00b7 by attending, whenever possible, all General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 by  attending  the  meetings  of  the  Board  Committees of which he/she is a member.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  gives  shareholders  all useful  information  on  the  Directors'  individual  participation in these sessions and meetings.\n\nIn connection with decisions to be made, the Director must ensure that he/she has all the information he/she considers essential for the smooth conduct of the work of the Board or the Committees. If this information is not made available to him/her,  or  he/she  considers  that  it  has  not  been  made available,  he/she  must  request  such  information  from  the Chairman of the Board who is required to ensure that the Directors are in a position to perform their duties.",

Training for Directors\n\nAll  the  Directors,  and  in  particular  those  representing  the employees, may  benefit, on their appointment or throughout their directorship, from the appropriate training programmes for the performance of the office.\n\nThese training programmes are organised and proposed by the Company and are provided at its expense.\n\n## 3.5. Obligation of reserve and confidentiality\n\nThe Directors undertake not to express themselves individually  other  than  in  the  internal  deliberations  of  the Board on questions raised at Board meetings.\n\nOutside the Company, only collegial expression is possible, particularly in the form of releases intended to provide the markets with information.\n\nWith  regard  to  information  not  in  the  public  domain  to which the Director has access as a result of his duties, the Director  must  consider  him/herself  to  be  bound  by  strict professional confidentiality, which is more demanding than the  mere  legal  obligation  of  discretion.  This  obligation applies to all persons called on to attend Board meetings, and covers all information of a confidential nature and all information  presented  as  confidential  by  the  Chairman  of the Board.\n\nBeyond this legal obligation and to ensure the quality of the discussions  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all  the  information given to Board members and the opinions they express must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nThis  obligation  applies  to  any  person  invited  to  attend  a Board meeting.\n\n## 3.6. Stock market ethics\n\n## 3.6.1. Principles\n\nThe  Company has put in  place  a  'Stock  Market  Code  of Ethics'  that  is  regularly  updated,  in  particular  to  take  into account changes in the regulations in force. This Code was updated  following  the  applicability,  as  from  3  July  2016, of European Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse ('Market  Abuse  Regulation').  The  Board  members  comply with the Principles of Stock Market Ethics 'related to inside information' provided for by this code.\n\nInside information must only be used by the Director in the exercise of his office. Such information must in no case be communicated to a third party other than in the exercise of the Director's duties, and for any other purpose or any other activity than those for which it is held.\n\nIt is the duty of all Directors to refrain from trading in, having others  trade  in,  or  enabling  others  (including  through recommendations  or  encouragements)  to  trade  in  the securities  of  the  Company on the basis of this information, until such time as the information has been made public.\n\nIt is the personal responsibility of each Director to determine whether the information he/she holds is inside information or not, and accordingly whether he/she may or may not use or transmit any of the information, and whether he/she may or  may  not  trade  or  have  others  trade  in  the  Company's securities.\n\n## 3.6.2. Abstention periods\n\nDuring  the  period  preceding  the  publication  of  any  inside information  to  which  Directors  have  access,  in  their capacity of insiders, the members of the Board must by law refrain from all trading in the Company's securities.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation and  the  recommendations  of  the  French  Financial  Markets Authority  -  AMF,  they  are  prohibited  from  trading  in  the Company's shares over the following periods:\n\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  30  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication of the press release on the annual and halfyear results;\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  15  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication  of  the  press  release  on  quarterly  financial information.\n\nThe Directors are only authorised to trade in L'Or\u00e9al shares on the day after publishing the press release.\n\n## 3.6.3. Insider trading\n\nThe  Director  has  been  informed  of  the  provisions  in  force relating to the holding of inside information, insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of inside information: Articles  465-1 et  seq .,  L.  621-14  and  L.  621-15,  III  c  of  the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 7 et seq. of the Market Abuse Regulation.\n\n## 3.6.4. Obligation to declare trading in the securities of the Company\n\nIn accordance  with  the  applicable  regulations,  the Directors  and  closely  associated  persons,  as  defined  by Article  3.1.26  of  the  Market  Abuse  Regulation,  must  inform the AMF (1) of all acquisitions, sales, subscriptions or trades of the  Company's  shares  and  transactions  involving  related instruments where the cumulative amount of such transactions is higher than \u20ac20,000 for the current calendar year.\n\nThe  Directors  and  closely  associated  persons  must  submit their declarations to the AMF by email within three trading days following completion of the transaction.\n\nThese individuals must simultaneously provide a copy of this declaration  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Company's  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe declarations are then posted on the AMF's website and are  mentioned  in  an  annual  summary  set  out  in  the Company's Management Report.",

Modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 4.1. Convening the Board\n\nThe Board is convened by any appropriate means. Notices convening a meeting may be transmitted by the Secretary of the Board of Directors. They are sent in writing at least eight days prior to each meeting, except in particular circumstances. The notices specify the venue of the meeting, which may be the headquarters or any other venue.\n\nAll the documents that are necessary to inform the Directors about the agenda and about any questions submitted to the  Board  for  review  are  enclosed  with  the  notice convening  the  meeting  or  are  sent  or  provided  to  them within a reasonable period of time, prior to the meeting.\n\nThese  documents  may  be  provided  to  them  on  a  secure digital platform, within a reasonable period of time prior to the  meeting.  They  may  in  exceptional  cases  be  provided at the meeting.\n\n## 4.2. Board meetings and method of participation\n\nThe  Board  meets  as  often  as  required  in  the  best  interest of the Company, and at least five times per year.\n\nThe dates of the Board meetings for the following year are set  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  summer,  except  in the case of Extraordinary Meetings.\n\nThe frequency and length of Board meetings must be such that they allow for an in-depth review and discussion of the matters  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  remits  of  the Committees.\n\nThe  Directors  meet  once  a  year  without  the  presence  of the  executive  corporate  officer,  the  Directors  representing the employees or any other Group employee.\n\nIn accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions and with  Article  9  section  2  of  the  Articles  of  Association, Directors  who  take  part  in  Board  meetings  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities are deemed to be present for the purpose of calculating  the quorum and the majority.\n\nThese  means  must  guarantee  simultaneous,  continuous retransmission of the debates.\n\nHowever, these means of participation are excluded when the Board so decides and in any event when it decides with regard to closing of the Company's parent company and consolidated financial  statements  and  on  the  preparation of the Management Report.\n\nA Director who participates by means of videoconference or  teletransmission  must  ensure  that  the  confidentiality  of the debates is preserved.\n\nThe attendance register mentions the Board members who attend  Board  meetings  by  means  of  videoconference  or telecommunication  facilities,  with  the  Secretary  of  the meeting having the task of initialling the register for them.\n\nThe  Board  may  take  the  following  decisions  by  written consultation  with  the  Directors,  electronically  if  necessary: (i)  co-optation of Directors, (ii) authorisations related to the sureties, endorsements and warranties referred to in Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, (iii) amendments to the Articles of Association to ensure compliance with the legislative  and  regulatory  provisions,  when  the  Annual General  Meeting  has  approved  a  delegation  for  this purpose, (iv) the convening of the Annual General Meeting and (v) decisions to transfer the registered office within the same department.\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Board Secretary  will  send  the  consultation  to  each  Director,  with an  indication  of  the  appropriate  deadline  by  which  to respond,  as  determined  by  the  Chairman  based  on  the decision  to  be  taken,  the  urgency  or  the  time  required  to reflect on the vote to be made. The document provided for this  purpose  details  the  procedures  of  the  consultation, its purpose,  a  presentation  and  the  reasons  for  the proposed  decision,  as  well  as  the  draft  deliberation. Directors  who  have  not  responded  by  the  end  of  the specified deadline will not be considered to form part of the quorum for the purposes of taking the decisions set out in the  consultation,  unless  the  Chairman  has  extended  the said deadline. The Secretary of the Board counts the votes of the Directors on the proposed resolution and informs the Board of the result of the vote.\n\n## 4.3. Minutes of Board meetings\n\nMinutes are prepared for each Board meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting mention the use of videoconference  or  telecommunication  facilities  and  the name  of  each  person  who  participated  in  the  Board  by such  means.

Secretary of the Board\n\nThe Secretary is appointed by the Board. He/she assists the Chairman in organising the Board's work and in particular with regard to the definition of the annual work programme and the dates of Board meetings.\n\nWith  the  support  of  the  General  Management,  he/she ensures the quality and production, sufficiently in advance, of the documents and drafts put to the vote of the Board at its meetings.\n\nHe/she prepares the draft minutes of Board meetings, which are submitted for the Board's approval.\n\nHe/she  is  responsible  for  the  secure  IT  platform  made available to the Directors.\n\nHe/she  monitors  on  an  ongoing  basis  changes  in  the regulations and reflections in the marketplace with regard to the corporate governance of listed companies.\n\nThe  Secretary  organises,  together  with  the  Chairman,  the annual  evaluation  of  the  Board's  work  and  receives  the annual  reports  on  independence  by  each  Director  (see Article 3.2).\n\nEvery Director may consult the Board Secretary at any time with regard to the scope of the rights and obligations linked to his/her office.\n\n## 4.5. Annual evaluation\n\n## of the modus operandi of the Board\n\nEvery year, the Board carries out an evaluation of its ability to respond to the expectations of shareholders by reviewing its composition, its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nAt  its  last  meeting  for  the  year  and  on  the  basis  of  a summary of the interviews that are previously organised and conducted  with  each  Director,  based  on  a  guide  which includes  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the  AFEPMEDEF  Code,  the  Board  discusses  points  of  view  and opinions  expressed.  It  draws  the  conclusions  from  this  with the aim of improving the conditions for the preparation and organisation of its work and that of its Committees.\n\nThe results of the evaluation, with the avenues of progress that remain open, are passed on to the shareholders in the Annual Report and at the time of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 5. Board Committees\n\nWhen  the  Board  sets  up  Committees,  it  appoints  the members of these Committees and determines their duties and responsibilities.\n\nThese Committees act within the remit granted to them by the  Board  and  therefore  have  no  decision-making  power. The Committees may not at any time take over the powers of the General Management as set out in chapter 1.2.2. of these Rules.\n\nThe Committee members are Directors. They are appointed by  the  Board  in  person  and  may  not  be  represented. All  Board  members  have  the  necessary  qualifications  due\n\nto  their  professional  experience.  They  actively  take  part  in Committee meetings with complete freedom of judgement and in the interest of the Company.\n\nThe task of secretary of each Committee is carried out by a  person  appointed  in  agreement  with  the  Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Committee. It may also be performed by the Secretary of the Board.\n\nEach  Committee  defines  the  frequency  of  its  meetings. These meetings are held at the Company's headquarters or at any other place decided by the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Committee.\n\nThe  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  each  Committee  prepares the agenda for each meeting.\n\nThe Committees may make contact, in the performance of their  duties,  with  the  Company's  main  senior  managers,  in agreement  with  the  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  the  Board and  after  informing  the  General  Management  and  will report on such contacts to the Board.\n\nThe Board may entrust a Committee Chair, or one or more of its members, with a special assignment or project to carry out specific research or study future possibilities. The designated individual will report  on  this  work  to  the  Committee concerned such that the Committee may deliberate on this work and in turn report thereon to the Board.\n\nFor each Committee meeting, its members may decide to invite  any other person of their choice to attend as needs be  and  on  an  advisory  basis,  when  they  consider  it appropriate.\n\nIn its field of competence,  each  Committee  makes proposals and recommendations and expresses opinions as the case may be. For this purpose, it may carry out or have carried  out  any  studies  that  may  assist  the  Board's deliberations.  When  they  use  the  services  of  external consultants, the Committees must ensure that their service is objective.\n\n## 5.1. Strategy and Sustainability Committee\n\n## 5.1.1. Remits\n\nThe remit of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee is to throw  light,  through  its  analyses  and  debates,  on  the Group's strategic orientations as submitted to the Board of Directors and to monitor the implementation and advancement of significant operations in progress.\n\nThe Committee examines:\n\n- \u00b7 the  main  strategic  lines  of  development,  options  and projects  presented  by  the  General  Management,  and their  economic,  financial,  societal  and  environmental consequences;\n- \u00b7 opportunities for  acquisitions  or  investments  that  involve significant  amounts  or  represent  a  departure  from  the Group's  usual  business  operations,  and  the  conditions relating to their implementation;\n- \u00b7 financial transactions that could significantly change the balance sheet structure;\n- \u00b7 the Company's commitments with regard to Sustainable Development, in light of the issues specific to the Group's business activities and its objectives, and the means and resources put in place; and\n- \u00b7 the proposed strategic orientations to be defined by the Board  with  a  view  to  consultation  of  the  Central  Works Council.",

Remuneration policy applicable to the executive corporate officer\n\n## A/ Fundamental principles for determination of the remuneration of the executive corporate officer\n\nSpecific requirements for appointments as executive corporate officers for employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their careers in the Group\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  constant  practice  has  been  to  appoint  senior managers  who  have  completely  succeeded  in  the  various stages  of  their  careers  in  the  Group  as  executive  corporate officers.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the executive corporate officer is the logical result of this choice.\n\nIt must  make  it  possible  to  attract  the  most  talented employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  to  the  very  top  positions  in  General Management, without them being deprived for all that, after a  long  career  in  the  Group,  of  the  benefits  to  which  they would  have  continued  to  be  entitled  if  they  had  remained employees.\n\nTo  achieve  this  objective,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to maintain the employment  contract of the executive corporate officer with at least 15 years' service at the time of their appointment in the Group and ensured that the benefits under the suspended employment contract are not combined with those in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  and  intended  to  avoid  the combination  of  benefits  drawn  from  both  an  employment contract and a corporate office, could be fully achieved by maintaining the suspended employment contract and clearly separating  the  benefits  related  to  the  corporate  office  from those relating to the employment contract.\n\nThis is why the Board of Directors has decided to make a clear distinction between:\n\n- \u00b7 on the one hand, the remuneration components related to the corporate office: fixed and variable remuneration and grant of performance shares; and\n- \u00b7 on  the  other  hand,  the  other  benefits  that  may  be  due pursuant to the suspended employment contract: termination indemnities, retirement indemnities in the event of  voluntary  retirement  or  retirement  at  the  Company's request,  financial  consideration  for  the  non-compete clause and the defined benefit pension scheme\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits  that  may  be  due  under  the  employment  contract described above.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  aforementioned  pension  scheme, will  be  based on the amount of remuneration at the date of suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career, including the years spent as a corporate officer.\n\nInformation  on  the  benefits  that  could  be  owed  under  the suspended employment contract are discussed in section  2.4.3.  'Termination  indemnities  and  supplementary pension scheme applicable to corporate officers'.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is also considered in the same way as a senior manager during the term of their corporate office,  which  allows  them  to  continue  to  benefit  from  the additional  social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular,  from the defined contribution pension scheme, and the employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n## Remuneration that is consistent with the remuneration of the Company's senior managers\n\nThe remuneration policy for the executive corporate officer is in  line,  where  applicable,  with  the  policy  which  was  applied to them as senior managers.\n\nTheir level of remuneration as an executive corporate officer is set  on  the  basis  of  the  level  of  responsibilities  they  exercised in the company at the time of their appointment.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  based  on  the  same  foundations and  instruments  as  those  applied  to  the  Company's  senior managers.  The  remuneration  principles  are  therefore  stable and durable.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  informed  every  year  of  the  Group's Human  Resources  policy.  It  is  in  a  position  to  verify  the consistency  between  the  remuneration  of  the  executive corporate  officer  and  the  procedures  in  place,  particularly for the  members  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee, on  the  basis  of  the  work  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations and Governance Committee.",

It  supports  its development model. It promotes harmonious, regular, durable growth,  both  over  the  short  and  long  term.  The  Board  of Directors'  constant  desire  is  indeed  to  incite  the  General Management  both  to  maximise  performance  for  each financial  year  and  to  ensure  that  it  is  repeated  and  regular year-on-year.  This  is  in  line  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  stated  objective  of economic and societal excellence.\n\n## b) Performance targets that are directly correlated with those of the Company and create value\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  chooses  to  correlate  the  executive corporate officer's performance directly with the Company's performance  by  using  the  same  performance  indicators, financial indicators in particular.\n\nThe  choice  of  correlating  the  performance  criteria  for  the executive corporate officer's remuneration with the Company's  performance  indicators,  particularly  those  of  a financial  nature,  is  the  guarantee  of  a  clear  and  relevant remuneration policy.\n\nThese  criteria  make  it  possible  to  assess  L'Or\u00e9al's  intrinsic performance,  namely  its  progress  year-on-year  via  internal performance  indicators  and  also  its  relative  performance as  compared  to  its  market  and  its  competitors  via  external growth indicators.\n\nThe  objectives  adopted  generate  long-term  value  creation. In particular,  the  choice  of  varied  operational  financial criteria  aims  at  encouraging  durable,  balanced  growth. Overall long-term performance results from the convergence of these criteria.\n\nThese objectives must also be an incentive for the executive corporate  officer  to  adapt  the  Group's  strategy  to  the profound  transformations  in  the  world  of  beauty,  and  the digital revolution in particular.\n\n## c) Preponderant portion of the remuneration subject to performance conditions\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer's  remuneration  must  include a  predominant  portion  subject  to  performance  conditions, with annual and multi-annual assessment periods adapted to the time horizon of each of these objectives.\n\n## Remuneration that is directly in line with the Group's ambitious social, societal and environmental commitments\n\nThe remuneration must be designed to favour a regular and sustainable development, in line with the Group's commitments  with  regard  to  ethics,  and  respectful  of  the environment  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al  operates.  In  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al announced  its  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  vision  by  2030 in the context of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, which has a set of objectives for climate, biodiversity, water and the use of natural resources.\n\nThe social and societal commitment is just as important since no  environmental  transition  is  possible  without  an  inclusive society. The  annual  variable  portion  of  the  executive corporate officer's remuneration, and their long-term remuneration, includes non-financial criteria related to L'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose and the commitments made by the Group,  particularly  in  the  context  of  its  corporate  social, societal and environmental responsibility programmes.\n\nThese  criteria  will  be  assessed  year-on-year  with  a  long-term perspective.\n\n## Remuneration that creates medium and long-term value for the shareholders\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must be linked to the  changes  over  the  medium-to  long-term  in  the Company's intrinsic value and share performance. A  significant  portion  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration thus consists of performance shares, a significant percentage  of  which  is  retained  until  the  end  of  his/her corporate  office,  with  the  undertaking  not  to  carry  out  risk hedging transactions.\n\nThis leads  to  alignment  with  the  shareholders'  interests, understood as long-term value creation.",

It  serves  as  a  basis  to determine  the  maximum  percentage  of  the  target  annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nThe  target  annual  variable  remuneration  may  amount  to  a maximum of 100% of the fixed remuneration.\n\nThe  annual  variable  remuneration  may  exceed  100%  of the  fixed  remuneration  and  up  to  a  maximum  of  120% of  this  remuneration  in  order  to  be  able  to  remunerate outperformance.  This  outperformance  is  assessed  on  a criterion-by-criterion basis.\n\nThe aim is not to encourage inappropriate and excessive risk taking.  For  this  purpose,  the  annual  variable  remuneration remains reasonable in comparison with the fixed portion.\n\nThe variable remuneration is designed to align the executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  with  the  Group's  annual performance  and  to  promote  the  implementation  of  its strategy year after year.\n\nThe  variable  remuneration  is  based  on  precise  performance appraisal  criteria  determined  at  the  beginning  of  the  year by the Board of Directors.\n\nThese criteria are financial, non-financial and qualitative.\n\nThe financial and  non-financial criteria are simple and quantifiable. They represent a predominant portion of the annual variable remuneration. A limit is set on the qualitative portion.\n\nThe weighting of each of the criteria and the objectives to be met  are  set  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  in  question  and communicated to the executive corporate officer.",

This  potential grant to the executive corporate officer, duly documented by the Board of Directors, may not exceed a total annual ceiling (taking into account any grants already awarded in the year) of  5%  of  the  total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  that same financial year.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is required to retain 50% of the free shares finally vested to him or her at the end of the vesting period,  in  registered  form,  until  the  termination  of  his  or  her duties, following a review of the performance conditions.\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  makes  a  formal  undertaking not to enter into any risk hedging transactions with regard to the performance shares, until the end of the holding period set by the Board of Directors.\n\nAn  executive  corporate  officer  may  not  be  granted performance shares at the time of his or her departure.\n\n## Details of weighting of share-based remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe  performance  criteria  cover  all  shares  granted  to  the executive corporate officer.\n\nThey take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 in part, criteria for financial performance based on:\n- \u00b7 growth  in  comparable  cosmetics  sales  of  L'Or\u00e9al  as compared to a panel of L'Or\u00e9al's major direct competitors;\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n- \u00b7 in part, criteria for non-financial performance based on:\n- \u00b7 fulfilment of environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future  programme  (hereinafter  'L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future Commitments'):\n- -% of sites with 'carbon neutral' (1) status;\n- -% of formula ingredients that are bio-sourced, traceable and come from sustainable sources;\n- -% of plastic packaging that comes from either recycled or biobased sources;\n- -number of people benefitting from the Group's brands' social commitment programmes;\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  strategic  positions  including  the Executive Committee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considers  that  both  these  types  of criteria, assessed over a long period of three full financial years and  reapplied  to  several  plans,  are  complementary,  in  line with the objectives and specificities of the Group and likely to promote  continuous,  balanced  and  sustainable  long-term growth.

His  full-time  commitment  to  the  benefit  of  the Company's  Governance  is  an  importance  source  of  added value  for  the  Board,  which  wants  to  highlight  the  expertise of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  whose  in-depth  knowledge  of  the company,  its  environment  and  its  strategic  challenges  is  a major asset.\n\nThe  Chairman's  remuneration  matches  the  Board's  goal  of ensuring the continuity of its work and to allow development in light  of  the  increasingly  important  and  expected  duties  of  a Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  has  also  taken  into  consideration  the  extensive duties  it  has  decided  to  entrust  to  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  in  his position  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  as  described in section 2.1.2.3.\n\nFinally, the Board took into account of the expectations of the stakeholders, by placing this remuneration in perspective with the remuneration offered by an international reference panel that was  defined  with  the  assistance  of  an  external independent consultancy firm.\n\nThe analysis of remunerations of Chairs of Boards of Directors of companies  in  the  reference  panel  used,  which  includes  six companies  with  a  dissociated  governance  structure  already used in the reference panel for the remuneration of executive corporate  officers,  reports  an  average  remuneration  of \u20ac1,658,900 and a median remuneration of \u20ac746,200 with large standard deviations.\n\nAs a result of this analysis and on the recommendation of the Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board of  Directors  at  its  meeting  of  9  February  2023  propose  to  the Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2023  to  set  the  fixed annual remuneration of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board, at \u20ac1,600,000.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon notified the Company of the termination of his employment contract on 30 April 2021, in order to be able to  benefit  from  his  mandatory  retirement  rights  as  from 1  May  2021.  Under  his  employment  contract,  he  is  able  to benefit  from  a  gross  annual  pension  benefit  of  \u20ac1.59  million under  L'Or\u00e9al's  supplementary  defined  benefit  pension scheme  ' Garantie  de  Retraite  des  Membres  du  Comit\u00e9 de  Conjoncture '  (Pension  Cover  of  Members  of  the  Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) which has been closed since 31  December  2000 (1) . The  Board  of  Directors  agreed  to Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  wish  to  waive  his  entitlement  to  this supplementary  pension  benefit  once  again  for  2023,  so  as not  to  combine  it  with  a  fair  remuneration  for  the  duties of Chairman as set out by the Board in this policy.\n\n## Illustration of the compensation policy in 2023: breakdown of the components of remuneration attributable to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n|                           | Amount     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed  remuneration       | \u20ac1,600,000 | At its  meeting of 9 February 2023, on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  is  proposing  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2023  that Mr Jean-Paul Agon's fixed remuneration be maintained at the gross annual amount of \u20ac1,600,000.                                                                                                                                           |\n| Benefits in               |            | \u25cf Benefits in kind                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| addition  to remuneration |            | Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  will  benefit  from  the  material  resources  needed  for  the  performance  of  his  office such as, for example, the provision of a car with a driver.

Decision-making, review and implementation process for the remuneration of corporate officers\n\nRemuneration is established in such a way as to guarantee the due and proper application of the policy and rules set by the Board  of  Directors.  The  Board  relies  on  the  work  and recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  composed  of  six  Directors,  60%  of  whom  are independent  Directors,  including  its  Chairwoman,  and  one member of whom is a Director representing the employees (2) . The corporate officer is not a member of the Committee. The Committee's recommendations are made taking into account\n\nthe  studies  carried  out  at  its  request  by  an  independent consulting firm.\n\nThe  Committee  met  4  times  in  2022  and  its  work  is  detailed in section 2.3.3. 'Activities of the Board Committees'.\n\nThe  Committee  has  the  necessary  information  to  prepare  its recommendations  and  more  particularly  to  assess  the performance  of  the  corporate  officer  in  light  of  the  Group's short and long-term objectives.\n\nThe purpose of this organisation and this process is to prevent any conflicts of interest.",

These  companies operate  on  similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector, direct  competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider everyday  consumer  goods  market,  as  regards  all  or  part  of their business activities.\n\nThe  panel  applicable  for  2022  comprised  Directors  of  the following 14 companies:\n\n## PANEL SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n| Beiersdorf         | Colgate  Palmolive   | Coty   | Danone             |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Est\u00e9e Lauder       | GSK                  | Henkel | Johnson  & Johnson |\n| Kimberly Clark     | Kering               | LVMH   | Procter  & Gamble  |\n| Reckitt  Benckiser | Unilever             |        |                    |\n\nIt  is  used  to  assess  the  competitiveness  of  the  executive corporate  officer's  total  remuneration.  This  panel  reports  an average remuneration of \u20ac9,539,600 and a median remuneration of \u20ac8,357,500. In  terms  of  market  capitalisation, L'Or\u00e9al is above the third quartile of companies on this panel.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  Company's  remuneration  policy, specifically  that  in  place  for  senior  management  executives, aims to position their remuneration between the median and the third quartile. The studies conducted with the independent consulting firm also enable the Committee to measure:\n\n- \u00b7 the competitiveness of the overall remuneration in comparison to this benchmark panel;\n- \u00b7 the  relevance  over  time  of  the  overall  remuneration structure and the objectives assigned to him/her;\n- \u00b7 the  comparative  results  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  light  of  the  criteria adopted by the Group to assess the executive corporate officer's performance; and\n- \u00b7 the link between  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration and his or her performance.\n\n## Non-executive corporate officer\n\nTo determine the positioning of the Chairman's remuneration, a  panel  was  defined  with  the  help  of  an  independent consultancy firm. It is composed of 17 international companies, selected  on  the  basis  of  governance,  industry,  size  and nationality.\n\nThey are the following dual governance companies:\n\n## PANEL SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n| AstraZeneca   | AB In Bev          | BASF   | Bayer       | Coty     | Diageo   |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Est\u00e9e  Lauder | GSK                | Henkel | Kraft Heinz | Linde    | Nestl\u00e9   |\n| Novartis      | Reckitt  Benckiser | Roche  | Starbucks   | Unilever |          |\n\nThe analysis of remunerations of Chairs of Boards of Directors of companies  in  the  reference  panel  used,  which  includes  six\n\ncompanies  with  a  dissociated  governance  structure  already used  in  the  reference  panel  for  the  remuneration  of  the executive corporate officer, reports an average remuneration of  \u20ac1,658,900  and  a  median  remuneration  of  \u20ac746,200  with large standard deviations.\n\n## The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee has all the useful internal information in its possession\n\nThis  information  enables  it  to  assess  the  performance  of  the Company  and  that  of  its  executive  corporate  officer  both from a financial standpoint and in non-financial areas.\n\nThe  Group's  annual  economic  and  financial  results  are presented  every  year  completely  and  exhaustively  to  the members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  at  its  Committee  meeting  in  February,  and  are used  as  a  basis  for  the  assessment  of  the  financial performance  criteria  for  the  executive  corporate  officer's variable remuneration.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  Human  Resources  policy  are  regularly presented  to  the  Committee  members  or  at  a  Board  of Directors  meeting  by  the  Chief  Human  Relations  Officer.  The Directors are therefore able to verify the consistency between the remuneration of the executive corporate officer and the remuneration and employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer  also regularly explains the policy and the actions taken in this field.\n\n2  members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  are  members  of  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee  at  which  the  actions  taken  with  regard  to  the programmes concerning the Group's social and environmental responsibility are discussed.\n\nThis information contributes to the assessment  of the non-financial  and  qualitative  portion  of  the  annual  variable remuneration.\n\nThe Committee can also carry out a more in-depth evaluation of the Company's performance by contacting the Company's main  senior  managers,  after  having  informed  the  General Management.\n\nThis  information  enriches  their  vision  of  the  strategy  and performances  of  the  Company  and  its  executive  corporate officer.\n\nRecommendations are made on these bases to the Board of Directors,  which  then  makes  its  decisions  on  the  executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  collectively,  in  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  work  of  the  Committee  on  the remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate  officer  is  shown  in the chart below.\n\n## The Committee examines the expectations of investors and proxy advisors, and the rules and recommendations of the regulatory authorities\n\nThe Human Resources and Remuneration Committee carefully analyses the law and reports concerning executive remuneration, notably the French financial markets authority's (AMF) report on corporate governance and the remuneration of executives of listed companies, and the report of the High Committee on Corporate Governance.\n\nIt  is  mindful  of  the  observations and requests of investors and strives  to  accommodate  them  while  preserving  consistency in the remuneration policy adopted by the Board and subject to constraints relating to the  confidentiality of certain information.",

In such case, the Board of Directors would be able to grant  an element of remuneration not provided for in the remuneration policy  previously  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting, but necessary in view of these exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  also,  within  the  framework  of  its discretionary power,  adapt  the  remuneration  policy  if unforeseeable  or  exceptional  circumstances  so  justify.  Thus, for example, the recruitment of a new corporate officer under unforeseen conditions might require the temporary adaptation  of  some  existing  remuneration  elements  or  the proposal  of  new  remuneration  elements.  In  this  case,\n\nthe Board  of  Directors  would  take  into  account  the experience,  expertise  and  remuneration  of  the  executive concerned in order to propose exceptional remuneration that could not exceed the amount of the benefits he or she would have had to relinquish by leaving his or her previous role.\n\nIt  might  also  be  necessary  to  amend,  subject  to  compliance with  the  caps  determined  in  the  remuneration  policy,  the performance conditions governing the acquisition of all or some of the existing remuneration  elements  in  the  event  of exceptional  circumstances  resulting  from  a  significant  change in the Group's scope following a merger or sale, the acquisition or  creation  of  a  significant  new  business  activity  or  the elimination  of  a  significant  business  activity,  a  change  in accounting  policy  or  a  major  event  affecting  the  markets and/or L'Or\u00e9al's major competitors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  make  its  decisions  on  the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and, when necessary, after obtaining the opinion of an independent consulting firm.\n\n## 2022 work schedule of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee concerning the remuneration of the corporate officer\n\n## February 2022\n\nApril 2022\n\nOctober 2022\n\n## December 2022\n\n- \u25cf Recommendations on the remuneration of corporate officers for 2021:\n- \u00b7 evaluation of the 2021 annual variable remuneration after review of the non-financial results, for Mr Agon (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from 1 January to 30 April 2021) and Mr Hieronimus (Chief Executive Officer from 1 May to 31 December 2021);\n- \u00b7 draft Say on Pay ex post resolutions.\n- \u25cf Long-term incentive plan:\n- \u00b7 recognition of the performance levels achieved for the expiring 2018 Plan for the Conditional Grants of Shares (ACAs).\n- \u25cf Presentation of the 2022 study on the remuneration of corporate officers:\n- \u00b7 panel, balance and structure of remuneration, link between performance and remuneration.\n- \u25cf Recommendations concerning the 2022 remuneration policies:\n- \u00b7 applicable to corporate officers (Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board);\n- \u00b7 review of draft resolutions.\n- \u25cf Report on investor meetings on the remuneration policies for corporate officers\n- \u25cf Presentation of L'Or\u00e9al's remuneration policy:\n- \u00b7 coherence between the schemes in place in the company.\n- \u25cf 2022 ACAs Plan:\n- \u00b7 proposed award for the Chief Executive Officer, application of non-financial performance conditions for the first time (20% weighting).\n- \u25cf 2023 remuneration policy:\n- \u00b7 review of issues raised following initial discussions with investors and proxy advisors;\n- \u00b7 ratios on pay differentials: widening of the scope.\n\n## 2.4.2.

Remuneration paid during financial year 2022 or allocated for that year to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1. Fixed remuneration\n\n- At its meeting of 9 February 2022, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain Mr Nicolas Hieronimus's fixed annual remuneration at the gross amount of \u20ac2,000,000.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2. Annual variable remuneration\n\nWith  regard  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus'  annual  variable remuneration for 2022, the target was set at \u20ac2,000,000 gross on  an  annual  basis,  or  100%  of  his  fixed  remuneration,  with a  maximum  of  120%  of  fixed  remuneration  in  the  event of  outperformance,  or  \u20ac2,400,000  gross.  This  sum  represents the maximum amount of variable remuneration that may be paid to him.\n\nAt its meeting on 9 February 2022, the Board of Directors had set  the  variable  remuneration  criteria  applicable  for  2022 and the respective weighting of such criteria. Financial criteria represent 60% of the variable remuneration while non-financial criteria  represent  40%.  The  financial  criteria  are  directly correlated  with  the  Company's  economic  performance indicators: growth in sales and market share as compared to its  main  competitors,  in  operating  profit,  earnings  per  share (EPS) and cash-flow.\n\nOn 9 February 2023, the Board of Directors, on the basis of the recommendations  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee, assessed the performance of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus. The  rate  of  achievement  was  113%  of  objectives,  i.e.  a  rate  of achievement  of  113.7%  for  financial  criteria  and  111.9%  for non-financial and qualitative criteria.\n\nIt was  thus  decided  that,  in  respect  of  annual  variable remuneration  for  2022,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  would  be awarded an amount of \u20ac2,260,000.",

Granting of performance shares\n\nPursuant in particular to Articles L. 225-197-1 and L. 22-10-8 of the  French  Commercial  Code  and  the  authorisation  of  the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 21 April 2022, the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  on  13  October  2022,  taking into  account  the  performance  of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus and  the  share  price  valuation,  decided  to  grant  him  20,000 performance  shares  (ACAs  -  'Attributions  Conditionnelles d'Actions', existing conditional grants of shares), in accordance with the remuneration policy.\n\nThe  estimated  fair  value,  according  to  the  IFRS  standards applied in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, of one performance share (ACAs) for the 13 October 2022 plan, of which Mr Nicolas Hieronimus is part, is \u20ac303.33.\n\nThe  estimated  fair  value,  according  to  the  IFRS  standards, of  the  20,000  performance  shares  (ACAs)  granted  in  2022  to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus is therefore \u20ac6,066,600.\n\nThese  shares  will  only  vest,  in  whole  or  in  part,  once  the performance conditions described below are met.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nFinal  vesting  of  these  shares  is  subject  to  achievement  of performance  conditions  which  will  be  recorded  at  the  end of a four-year vesting period as from the grant date.\n\nThe  number  of  fully  vested  shares  will  depend  on  growth  in comparable  cosmetics  sales  compared  to  the  growth  of a  panel  of  competitors,  which  consists  in  2022  of  Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Shiseido, Beiersdorf, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao, and Coty (40%); on the growth in  the  Group's  consolidated  operating  profit  (40%);  on  the achievement  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme (15%) and on a gender balance target in strategic positions including the Executive Committee (5%).\n\nThe calculation will be based on the arithmetical average for the 3 full financial years of the vesting period. The first full year taken  into  account  for  assessment  of  the  performance conditions relating to this grant is 2023.\n\nAs regards all the free shares granted pursuant to the criterion relating  to  sales,  in  order  for  these  to  finally  vest  at  the  end of  the  vesting  period,  L'Or\u00e9al  must  outperform  the  average growth  in  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors.  Below  this  level, the grant decreases. If the L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales  is  lower  than  the  average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the panel  of  competitors,  no  shares  will  be  finally  vested  under this criterion.",

        "page_content": "Pursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  finally  vest  at  the  end  of  the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the Board but not made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  achieved or  exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  If  the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  criterion  of  fulfilling  commitments  made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, in order for all the free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  an  average  of  65%  of  the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments must be achieved during the  vesting  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases. No shares will vest if the average level of achievement for the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments falls below 50%.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  criterion  of  gender  balance  in  strategic positions,  in  order  for  all  the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, the  average  proportion  of  employees  of  each  gender  in strategic  positions  must  be  at  least  40%.  Below  this  level,  the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if  the  average  representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThe figures recorded year on year to determine the levels of performance achieved are published in Chapter 7.\n\n## Main features of the grant\n\nThis Plan enabled 700,000 performance shares (ACAs), i.e. 0,1% of the share capital, to be granted to 2,647 beneficiaries.\n\nThe  conditional  grant  of  performance  shares  benefiting Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  in  2022  represents  2.86%  of  the  total number  of  performance  shares  granted  and  0.004%  of  the share capital as at 26 July 2022.\n\nIn  addition,  as  a  corporate  officer,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will retain 50% of the shares that will finally vest at the end of the vesting  period  in  registered  form  until  the  end  of  his  term  of corporate office.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus has undertaken not to use risk hedging instruments.\n\nTo recap, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus was not awarded any other long-term incentives in 2022.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.4. Remuneration as Director\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus does not receive any remuneration as Director.\n\nHe  does  not  receive  any  remuneration  as  a  Director  of  the Group companies.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.5. Additional social protection schemes\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  continues  to  benefit,  because  of  his classification  as  a  senior  manager  during  his  term  of  office, from the additional social protection schemes and, in particular,  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme, and the employee  benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contributions to the employee benefit  and  healthcare  schemes  for  2022  amounted  to \u20ac4,217.94,  and  the  amount  of  the  employer's  contribution  to the  Defined  Contribution  Pension  scheme  amounted  to \u20ac6,376.08.\n\nUnder  the  Defined  Contribution  Pension  Scheme  ('L'Or\u00e9al RCD', as described in chapter 4), the rights of which are strictly proportional  to  the  contributions  paid,  and  which  benefits all  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  France,  the  estimated  amount of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus's  annual  retirement  pension  at 31 December 2022 would be a gross amount of \u20ac5,151.\n\nAs  for  all  other  senior  managers  of  the  Group,  the  pension resulting  from  the  employer  contributions  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  RCD will  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  the  Pension  Cover  for the  calculation  of  the  life  annuity  potentially  due  under  this plan so that these benefits are not combined.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  lifetime  risk  related  to  the  plans  resulting from  Article  83,  2\u00b0  of  the  French  General  Tax  Code  is  borne by the insurer.\n\n## 2.4.2.3. Remuneration paid or allocated to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.4.2.3.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 9 February 2022, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  fixed  annual  remuneration  at  the  gross amount of \u20ac1,600,000.\n\n## 2.4.2.3.2. Additional social protection schemes\n\nThe Chairman of the Board benefits from the same employee benefit scheme as the senior managers of the Company.\n\nThe  amount  of  employer  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans was  \u20ac3,433.",

Remuneration  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  all amounts  paid  and  performance  shares  granted  during the financial year in question.\n\nThe  elements  composing  the  executives'  remuneration  used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u00b7 the  annual  fixed  remuneration  paid  in  2022  (on  an  annual basis);\n- \u00b7 the  annual  variable  remuneration  paid  in  2022  (on  an annual basis); and\n- \u00b7 the performance shares valued on the grant date in 2022 in  accordance  with  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe elements composing employee remuneration used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u00b7 annual fixed remuneration paid in 2022;",

Termination indemnities and supplementary pension scheme applicable to corporate officers\n\nThe  termination  indemnities  and  supplementary  pension scheme  for  which  the  corporate  officers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  may  be eligible,  as  long  as  they  are  former  senior  managers  of  the company with more than 15 years of service, are not related to  performance  of  the  corporate  office,  but  could  be  due under the suspended employment contract.\n\nTherefore,  they  are  not  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2023 under resolution no. 12 'Approval of the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer'.\n\nShareholders approved  the  agreement  suspending  the executive  corporate  officer's  employment  contract  at  the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n## 2.4.3.1. Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code to which L'Or\u00e9al refers, recommends, but  does  not  require,  that  companies  should  put  an  end  to combining an employment contract with a corporate office.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  shares  the  objectives  of  this recommendation  which  aims  at  avoiding  the  possibility  of concurrently  obtaining  benefits  both  from  the  employment contract  and  the  corporate  office  and  at  prohibiting  any interference with the possibility of removing  executive corporate  officers ad  nutum . The  Board  of  Directors  has formally  provided  for  the  methods  of  application  of  the objectives of the recommendation, as adapted to the context in the L'Or\u00e9al Group.\n\nThe Board's intention is to use the treatment set out below for any new corporate officer appointed who has over 15 years' length  of  service  in  the  Group  at  the  time  of  his  or  her appointment.\n\nAs L'Or\u00e9al's ongoing policy is to appoint employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their careers in the Group as executive corporate officers, the Board does not want these executives to be deprived of the benefits to which they would have continued to be entitled had they remained employees,  after  spending  many  years  of  their  career  at L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  recommendation  could  be  fully achieved  by  maintaining  the  suspension  of  the  employment contract  and  clearly  separating  the  benefits  related  to  the corporate  office  from  those  relating  to  the  employment contract.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits that may be due under the employment contract.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  pension  under  the  defined  benefit scheme is based on the amount of remuneration at the date of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse ).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the reasons for such termination, the executive corporate officer would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or  retirement  indemnities  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement or  retirement  at  the  Company's  request  pursuant  to  the suspended  employment  contract  excluding  any  indemnity due in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries  (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques) and the company-level agreements applicable to all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to  the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries or the above-mentioned company-level agreements.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract, financial consideration for the non-compete clause would be paid  under  the  terms  of  said  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions  of  the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement for  the  Chemical  Industries,  unless  the  executive  corporate officer  were  to  be  released  from  application  of  the  clause. This clause does not apply in the event of voluntary retirement or compulsory  retirement  on  the  Company's  initiative: no consideration  for  non-competition  would  be  paid  in  such a situation.\n\n## 2.4.3.3. Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer,  subject  to  ending  his  or  her career in the Company, will benefit from one of the defined benefit  schemes  currently  applicable  to  the  Group's  senior managers. This is the scheme to which he or she was subject as an employee.",

These  schemes  were established by L'Or\u00e9al primarily with the goal of attracting and retaining  the  Company's  senior  managers  by  guaranteeing them a certain level of resources in retirement.\n\nThese schemes falling under Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, are now closed to any new beneficiaries and no longer  create  rights  as  from  31  December  2019  pursuant  to French  Order  no.  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  on  professional supplementary  pension  schemes  that  transposes  the  European Directive of 16 April 2014.\n\nThe  main  features  of  these  schemes  are  explained  in  detail in section 4.3.2.5.\n\nThey  concern  over  500  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  active  or  retired  senior managers, in France, and are financed by contributions paid to an insurance institution. These contributions are deductible from  the  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's  contribution  as  provided  by  Article  L.  137-11,  2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nIn  the  light  of  the  legal  characteristics  of  defined  benefit pension  schemes  (the  rights  only  accrue  if  the  beneficiary ends  his  career  in  the  Company  and  the  funding  of  this scheme  cannot  be  broken  down  individually  by  employee) and on account of the characteristics specific to the L'Or\u00e9al schemes, known as 'differential' schemes since they take into account, in order to supplement them, all the other pensions such as those resulting,  inter  alia,  from  the  French  basic  and supplementary  pension  schemes,  the  precise  amount  of  the pension  annuity  will  in  fact  only  be  calculated  on  the  date when the beneficiary applies for all his pensions.\n\n## 2.4.3.4. Application of the related-party agreements scheme\n\nThe  above  provisions  are  subject  to  the  procedure  for related-party agreements.\n\nFor  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  an  agreement  suspending  his employment contract was approved by the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 (resolution no. 15). This mechanism is restated every year in the present chapter and in the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements.\n\n## 2.4.3.5. Situation of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting of 20 April 2021 appointed Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  the  then  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer in charge of Divisions, and an employee of L'Or\u00e9al, as Chief  Executive  Officer  following  a  brilliant  career  spanning 34 years within L'Or\u00e9al. The Board of Directors did not wish for Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  by  accepting  the  role  of  Chief Executive Officer, to be deprived (at the age of 57 and after 34 years with L'Or\u00e9al) of the benefits to which he would have continued  to  be  entitled  had  he  remained  an  employee. Therefore,  the  Board  adopted  the  following  measures,  which were  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  20  April 2021 as part of the procedure for related-party agreements:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  to  be taken into account for all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for the calculation of the pension under the defined-benefit scheme described below, is based\n\non  his  remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  his employment contract. This reference remuneration is \u20ac1,750,000  of  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,850,000  of  variable remuneration.  This  remuneration  will  be  revised  annually  by applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of salaries and pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse). As at 1 January 2023,  it  was  \u20ac1,853,250  for  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,959,150 for variable remuneration.\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on  the  reasons  for  such  termination,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus would  only  be  paid  termination  indemnities,  except  in  the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  at  the Company's  request  pursuant  to  the  suspended  employment contract.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries  (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques)  and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries or the above-mentioned Company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nPursuant  to  the  schedule  of  indemnities  under  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries, in  the  event  of  dismissal,  except  in  the  event  of  gross misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  the  indemnity  would  be capped, in light of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' length of service, at 20  months'  remuneration  under  the  suspended  employment contract.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries and in the event of termination of the employment contract, the indemnity due in consideration of the  non-compete clause would be payable monthly for two years on the basis of two-thirds of the monthly fixed remuneration attached  to  the  suspended  employment  contract  unless Mr  Hieronimus  were  to  be  released  from  application  of  the clause.  This  clause  does  not  apply  in  the  event  of  voluntary retirement  or  compulsory  retirement  on  the  Company's initiative: no consideration for non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  continue  to  benefit,  under  his suspended  employment  contract,  from  the (Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  Former  Senior  Managers) scheme closed to new members effective from 31 December 2015. The income guarantee is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service in the Company up to 31 December 2019, up to a limit of 25 years. Generally, after 31  December  2019,  no  new  rights  will  be  granted  under  this scheme pursuant to French Order no. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 concerning  supplementary  professional  retirement ' Garantie  de Ressources des Retraites Anciens Cadres Dirigeants ' schemes,",

The  income  guarantee  may  not exceed 50% of the calculation base or exceed the average of the fixed portion of salaries; and\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  is  financed  by  contributions  paid  to  an insurance  institution.  These  contributions  are  deductible from  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe pension rights of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus are no longer likely to  change  insofar  as  he  has  more  than  25  years  of  service, the  ceiling  above  which  no  additional  annuity  is  granted under this scheme.\n\nFor  information  purposes,  the  gross  estimated  amount  of  the pension  that  would  be  paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  under L'Or\u00e9al's  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee for Former Senior  Managers)  scheme,  had  he  been  able  liquidate  on 31  December  2022  his  full-rate  pension  rights  under  French Social Security, after 34 years of service within L'Or\u00e9al, would represent \u20ac1.6 million.\n\nThis  information  is  given  as  an  indication  after  estimating  the main  pension  rights  accrued  by  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  a result  of  his  professional  activities,  according  to  the  rules  for payment  of  such  pensions  in  force  at  31  December  2022, which may be subject to change.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  pension  paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Ressources Dirigeants' (income guarantee for senior managers) will only be calculated on the date when he applies for all his pensions.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  rights  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  are uncertain and  conditional  on  the  completion  of  the beneficiary's  career  in  the  Company.  The  funding  of  this scheme  by  L'Or\u00e9al  cannot  be  broken  down  individually  by employee.\n\n## 4) AMF summary table\n\nThe table set out below, presented in the form recommended by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), clearly shows that there are no concurrent benefits under the suspended employment contract and the corporate office. It is also stated that the AMF  considers  that  a  company  complies  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  when  it  explains  the  maintenance  of  the  employment contract of a senior manager as an employee in the Company and his personal situation and provides detailed substantiation in this respect (1) .\n\n|                            | Employment   | Employment   | Supplementary  pension scheme  (2)   | Supplementary  pension scheme  (2)   | Indemnities or benefits due or which  may become due as a result  of termination or change of duties (3)   | Indemnities or benefits due or which  may become due as a result  of termination or change of duties (3)   | Indemnities relating to a non-compete clause  (4)   | Indemnities relating to a non-compete clause  (4)   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                            | Yes          | No           | Yes                                  | No                                   | Yes                                                                                                        | No                                                                                                         | Yes                                                 | No                                                  |\n| Mr Jean-Paul Agon          |              |              |                                      |                                      |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                            |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Chairman of the Board      |              | X            |                                      | X                                    |                                                                                                            | X                                                                                                          |                                                     | X                                                   |\n| Mr Nicolas Hieronimus  (1) |              |              |                                      |                                      |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                            |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Chief Executive Officer    | X            |              | X                                    |                                      |                                                                                                            | X                                                                                                          | X                                                   |                                                     |",

These indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment contract and in strict application of the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry ( ) and the company-level agreements applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labor law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the collective bargaining agreement or the above-mentioned company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration. Convention collective nationale des industries chimiques\n\nNicolas Hieronimus will continue to benefit, under his employment contract suspended for the term of his corporate office, from the ' Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants '  (Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  former  senior  managers) scheme,  closed  to  new  entrants  as  from  December  31,  2015.  Indemnities  are  calculated  according  to  the  number  of  years of  professional  activity  within  the  company  as  of  December  31,  2019,  up  to  a  maximum  of  25  years.  In  general,  subsequent  to December 31, 2019, no new entitlement is granted under this scheme pursuant to Order 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 on supplementary pension schemes, which provides for the closure of all defined-benefit schemes governed by Article L.137-11 of the French Social Security  Code  ( Code  la  s\u00e9curit\u00e9  sociale ).  The  main  features  of  this  scheme  are  described  in  Note  4.3.2.5  to  the  2021  L'Or\u00e9al Universal Registration Document. In this specific case, Nicolas Hieronimus reached the limit of 25 years' professional activity in the Group provided under the scheme in 2012 and therefore has not benefited from any new entitlement to supplementary annuities since such date.\n\nUnder his employment contract and in accordance with the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry, in  the  event  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract,  the  compensation under the non-compete clause would be payable monthly  over  two  years  based  on  two-thirds  of  the  monthly  fixed  remuneration  provided  for  in  the  suspended  employment contract, unless Nicolas Hieronimus was released from the application of this clause.  This clause is not applicable in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's request and no non-compete compensation would be paid in this situation.\n\nUnder  no  circumstances  shall  the  remuneration  received  for  the  corporate  office  be  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating benefits likely to be payable under the above-mentioned employment contract.\n\n- \u00b7 Terms and conditions relating to the suspension of Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract\n- \u00b7 The  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all  entitlements  attached  to  the  employment  contract  and particularly the calculation of the aforementioned retirement benefits, will be based on the amount of remuneration at the date of suspension of the employment contract in 2021, namely, fixed remuneration of \u20ac1,750,000 and variable remuneration of \u20ac1,850,000. This reference remuneration will be revised annually by applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of salaries and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund .  As  of January 1, 2023 it comprised a fixed portion of \u20ac1,853,250 and a variable portion of \u20ac1,959,150. ( Caisse  nationale  d'assurance  vieillesse )\n- \u00b7 The length of service applied will cover his entire career within the Group, including his years as executive officer.\n- \u00b7 The continued treatment of Nicolas Hieronimus in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office would allow him to benefit from the additional social protection schemes, including the defined-contribution pension scheme and employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees. This information is contained in the remuneration policy submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting of April 21, 2023.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 17, 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid DUPONT-NOEl\n\nC\u00e9line EYDIEU-BOUTTE",

        "page_content": "This  chapter  is  based  on  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Group's  Internal  Control  and  Risk Management departments. It presents the  internal  control  environment  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  including the system relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information. It describes the risk factors pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of 14 June 2017 ('Prospectus Directive  III'),  as  well  as  the  associated  risk  management  policy.  These  risks  are  presented  in four categories: (i) business risks, (ii) industrial and environmental risks, (iii) legal and regulatory risks,  (iv)  financial  and  market  risks.  The  main  non-financial  risks  within  the  meaning  of  the Non-Financial Performance Statement (1) are described in chapter 4. The Vigilance Plan (2) is also included in this chapter.\n\n## 3.1. Definition and objectives of Internal Control\n\n## 3.1.1. Reference work\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  preparing  this  Document  and  defining Internal  Control,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  used  the  Reference  Framework and  its  application  guide  published  by  the  French  Financial Markets  Authority  (AMF)  in  January  2007,  and  updated  on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.1.2. Internal Control - preventing and controlling risk\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (the  'Group'), which aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the Group's assets and reputation are valued and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing risks, the Internal Control system promotes the steady and sustainable manufacturing  and  economic  development  of  the  Group within  a  control  environment  that  is  appropriate  for  the Group's  businesses.  However,  any  system  or  process  has  its limitations. These result from a number of factors, in particular the uncertainties of the outside world or malfunctions due to technical or human failures.\n\nThe  handling  of  risk  should  be  based  in  particular  on  a reasonable  informed  choice  between  the  challenges  to  be controlled, the opportunities to be seized, the cost of the risk management measures, and the effects of these measures on the occurrence and impact of the risk.\n\n## 3.1.3. A process for the continual improvement of the Internal Control system\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued its efforts to improve the system of Internal Control by, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf constantly  adjusting  the  Group  matrix  for  the  segregation of duties and the associated control environment;\n- \u00b7 providing new operational guides to remind employees of the Group's  principles  and  enable  the  sharing  of  best  practices (e.g. the e-commerce control  playbook);\n- \u00b7 updates  to  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control'  digital library  (for  example,  on  business  continuity  plans  and sourcing);\n- \u00b7 regularly  adapting  the  reference  frameworks  to  address new challenges;\n- \u00b7 updating the Group's digital referential (3) ; and\n- \u00b7 revamping of the programme to raise awareness of the risks of fraud.\n\nThe  deployment  of  online  training  (prevention  of  corruption, data  security,  competition,  cyber  security,  personal  data protection) is ongoing.\n\nThe  network  of  Internal  Control  managers  continued  to  be built up worldwide through:\n\n- \u00b7 specific training courses;\n- \u00b7 informative  webchats  for  sharing  updates  on  Group projects and business standards; and\n- \u00b7 a  special-purpose  communication  platform  that  promotes the sharing of best practices.",

Components of the Internal Control and Risk Management system d a n s l e\n\nn\n\nr\n\ne\n\nt\n\n## 3.2.1. Organisation and environment\n\nThe  control  environment  is  critical  to  the  Internal  Control system. It means risks can be managed well and procedures implemented.  It  is  based  on  behaviours,  the  organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment  communicated  by  senior management. This is in line with the Group's strategic choices.\n\n## The Group's Ethical Principles\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  development  and  reputation  are  built  on  strong Ethical Principles: Integrity, Respect, Courage and Transparency. The  Group's  policies  on  sustainable  development,  social  and societal  responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based on the Ethical Principles.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Code  of  Ethics  is  available  in  45  languages  and  in Braille  in  English  and  French.  It  is  distributed  to  all  employees around the world. It uses simple rules and concrete examples to explain how they can apply these Ethical Principles in their behaviours and actions.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  applies  to  all  employees,  directors  and corporate  officers  and  members  of  the  Executive  and Management Committees. Since 2010, 18 supplements to the Code  of  Ethics  have  covered  certain  aspects  of  it  in  more detail.\n\n## The Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer\n\nThe Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer reports directly to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  keeps  him  informed  on  a regular  basis.  The  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer regularly  informs  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Executive Committee. His mission on Ethics is to:\n\n- \u00b7 promote  and  integrate  best  practices  within  the  Group, by facilitating ethical decision-making;\n\ns\n\n- \u00b7 oversee employee training;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  management  of  alerts  and  directly  manage those related to senior management positions; and\n- \u00b7 measure and assess the Company's ethical performance.\n\nThey  have  a  dedicated  budget  and  team,  and  unrestricted access to all information about the Group's business activities. They can call upon any of the Group's teams and resources in the performance of their work.\n\n## The Ethics and Human Rights approach of L'Or\u00e9al and its stakeholders\n\nCountry  Managers  (or  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of  Ethics.  The  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer systematically  meets  each  new  Country  Manager  and  the Group's senior managers to provide guidance about their role. Senior managers also benefit from a tool to help develop their ethics leadership as well as specific training.\n\nThe  78  Ethics  Correspondents  throughout  the  world  assist members of the Executive Committee and Country Managers to implement the Ethics programme. Led by the Group Ethics team,  they  provide  all  employees  with  a  local  point  of contact.  They  promote  the  normal  routes  for  handling concerns by Management and Human Resources.\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  a  member  of  the Executive  Committee,  oversees  the  respect  of  Human  Rights and fundamental freedoms in the Group.\n\nThe ethical and Human Rights risks are mapped and regularly updated, which includes suppliers and subcontractors (see  section  3.4.3.).  Country  Managers  assess  and  analyse local  ethical  risks  using  a  dedicated  tool.  They  adopt  the necessary prevention measures.",

        "page_content": "An annual reporting system is used to monitor the implementation of the Ethics and Human Rights programme. The  Global  Ethics,  Risk  &  Compliance  Department  informs subsidiaries of their potential areas for improvement. Ethics risks are systematically reviewed during audit assignments, through individual  interviews  conducted  separately  with  the  Country Manager and the Administrative and Financial Director.\n\nFor  prospective  acquisitions,  the  Ethics  and  Human  Rights questionnaire helps to determine whether the target company takes  account  of  risks,  particularly  those  related  to  business ethics.\n\nA  specific  and  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics  is available  in  all  subsidiaries.  As  at  31  December  2022,  87% of the employees with access to the training had completed this course. The Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department also provides face-to-face training as part of the ongoing training of managers  and  certain  business functions (Country Managers, Buyers, Human Resources).\n\nThe evaluation of the overall performance of employees takes into account compliance with the Code of Ethics and Ethical Principles.  Regular  communication  with  stakeholders  and  the setting up of internal working groups help to incorporate Ethics into  new  policies  and  strategic  decisions  (for  example, the Reliable Artificial Intelligence Policy in 2022).\n\nThe  Group's  whistleblowing  line  (www.lorealspeakup.com), available  to  all  Group  stakeholders,  as  well  as  a  procedure to  collect  and  process  reports,  make  it  possible  to  manage any violations.\n\nIn  2022,  510  potential  ethical  violations  were  identified  either via  the  secure  website,  or  via  the  Ethics  Correspondents  or local or international management. After reported cases have been thoroughly examined, appropriate measures are taken, where applicable. The global number  of reports of discrimination,  harassment  (including  sexual  harassment)  and corruption  received  at  Group  level  worldwide  is  notified  to employees  on  a  regular  basis,  as  is  the  number  of  fully  or partially  substantiated  cases  and  the  corrective  measures taken.\n\n## Ethics Day : an annual day on ethics\n\nThe  Group  has  held  Ethics  Day  since  2009.  During  this  online event hosted by the Chief Executive Officer, Group employees can ask questions and discuss the day-to-day application of the Ethical Principles. Each  member  of  the  Executive Committee and each Country Manager organises local ethics discussions. In 2022, with nearly 35,000 people logging on and more than 7,600 questions, employees showed that they were heavily  engaged  with  this  subject.  Furthermore,  they  receive regular information about the Group's Ethical policy and have access to a dedicated Intranet site.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n\nFor many years, L'Or\u00e9al has adopted an ambitious CSR policy, through  its  sustainability  programmes  and  its  commitment  to the Science-Based Targets (1) initiative, in particular.\n\nIn this context, the Group has developed a strong governance structure  (see  section  4.1.),  which  includes  the  establishment of sustainable development Coordinators worldwide. They are tasked  with  helping  the  Country,  Zone,  Division  and  Brand Managers  to  implement  the  sustainability  programme  within their  entities.  The  progress  of  local  implementation  of  the Group's  commitments  is  monitored  by  means  of  an  annual reporting system.\n\nInternal Audit regularly reviews CSR risks, as well as the extent to which  any  policies  adopted  to  address  such  risks  have progressed. The results are then reported to the Audit Committee. Since  2019,  in  collaboration  with  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance  Department,  L'Or\u00e9al's  CSR  Department  has conducted a deeper assessment of the risks related to climate change  on  the  Group's  operations.  Relying  in  particular  on the scenario analysis method, the Group intended to improve its  ability  to  anticipate and mitigate the impact of these risks. It should be noted that the financial risks related to the effects of climate change and the Group's measures to reduce them are described in chapter 4.\n\n## Human Resources policy\n\nThe quality and skills of female and male employees are key components of  the  Internal  Control  system.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Human Resources  (HR)  Department  has  always  had  the  mission  of supporting the Group's growth and supporting its transformation  initiatives.  In  order  to  be  sustainable,  L'Or\u00e9al's growth  relies  first  and  foremost  on  the  women  and  men  in the Company, who are the key drivers of the Group's success. Built  this  conviction,  the  Group's  human  and  social  project is  based  on  individualised  management  of  employees  and on collective strength.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's HR policy is based on the identification, recruitment and development of employees throughout their career, and on  the  rewarding  and  commitment  of  all,  as  well  as  on  an active policy on diversity and inclusion. Dedicated policies are developed  within  the  Group  in  each  of  these  areas (see section 4.3.2.).\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe Group's Global IT Department issues strategic orientations for its IT systems  and  information  systems  security  (ISS) guidelines. The systems incorporate 'ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)', a management software application used by the vast majority of commercial subsidiaries. The worldwide roll-out of  this  integrated  software  package  reinforces  the  reliability and  security  of  producing  information,  including  accounting and  financial  information.  In  pursuit  of  the  same  objective, the deployment of an integrated production and management solution in the Group's manufacturing entities is continuing.",

        "page_content": "## The procedures and standards governing the activities\n\nEach Support Department defines, in its own specific field, the principles and standards applicable to the entities it manages. These  principles  and  standards  are  summarised  in  the 'Fundamentals of Internal Control', a guide which is regularly updated  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department, so that employees can adopt them more easily. This document provides a reference framework for the  Group.  It  covers  operational  activities  in  the  form  of  an information sheet for each area of activity. Each information sheet refers to the detailed charters, codes and standards of the Group. The sheets are regularly updated, expanded and validated by the Support Departments.\n\nA  management  segregation  of  duties  standard  is  regularly updated and distributed to all entities. It defines the main rules for  sales,  purchasing,  logistics,  finance,  human  resources  and information  systems  management.  The  application  of  these rules prevents the risks of fraud and reduces the probability that errors (whether intentional or not) may remain undetected.\n\n## Communication of information inside the Group\n\nThe  'Fundamentals of  Internal  Control'  are  circulated  to  the Managing  Directors,  Finance  Directors,  and  Internal  Control Managers  of  all  the  consolidated  subsidiaries,  including manufacturing  entities.  The  Fundamentals,  codes,  charters, standards,  and  information  related  to  the  organisation, changes  and  instructions  from  the  Support  Departments  are made  permanently  available  to  the  subsidiaries  on  the Group's  Intranet  sites.  A  Group  digital  standard  provides  all employees  with  guides,  charters and  expert  contacts organised by function and by subject.\n\nThe  Support  Departments  also  hold  seminars  and  training sessions  for  their  networks  of  experts.  News  published  on  the Intranet  gives  employees  news  updates  and  meaningful messages on Internal Control.\n\nWithin  the  Group,  two  tools  promote  communication  on  the priorities of Internal Control:\n\n- 1. the 'Internal Control Awards', which take place every two years and reward the best global initiatives; and\n- 2. the  Internal  Control  Department's  Intranet  site,  which disseminates Internal Control's initiatives, tools and events all over the world.\n\n## 3.2.2. Control\n\n## and supervision activities: those involved and their roles\n\nRisk  management  and  Internal  Control  is  the  business  of everyone,  from  governance  bodies  to  all  employees.  This system is continually monitored to ensure it is relevant, meets the  Group's  objectives  and  addresses  its  issues.  The  main players in the monitoring  of  Internal  Control  and  risk management are:\n\n- \u00b7 the General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee);\n- \u00b7 the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee in particular;\n- \u00b7 the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department,  the  Internal Control Department and the Internal Audit Department;\n- \u00b7 the Support Departments; and\n- \u00b7 the Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones.\n\n## The General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee)\n\nThe  General  Management  defines  the  general  principles  of Internal  Control  and  ensures  their  proper  implementation.  In order  to  fulfil  their  global  Internal  Control  responsibilities,  the members of the Executive Committee rely on operational and functional  managers,  according  to  their  areas  of  expertise. These  managers  must  ensure  these  general  principles  are implemented and the procedures correctly applied to achieve the level of Internal Control required by General Management.\n\n## The Board of Directors and Audit Committee\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  always  asserted  the  importance of  Internal  Control  and  its  main  areas  of  application (1) . The  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  define  the  Audit Committee's duties:\n\n- \u00b7 it monitors the action taken by Internal Control and reports this to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 it  oversees  the  preparation  of  financial  and  non-financial information; and\n- \u00b7 each year, it reviews the Internal Audit plan, its objectives and the general conclusions of Internal Audit assignments, as  well  as  the  initiatives  and  major  projects  that  relate to  Internal  Control.  The  Committee  uses  this  information to prepare a report on its remarks for the Board of Directors.\n\n## Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones\n\nThe Group is organised into Divisions and Zones. Alongside the Management  of  each  country,  business  or  manufacturing entity,  the  Divisions  and  Zones  are  fully  responsible  for achieving the Internal Control objectives defined by General Management.\n\nA system of delegating authorities is in place and continues to be  reinforced.  The  powers  of  the  legal  representatives  of Group companies and of those to whom they delegate are limited  and  controlled  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the  Legal  Charter.  Specialists  in  management,  information systems, Human Resources, digital, retail, purchasing, logistics, production  and  legal  affairs  provide  support  to  operations at all levels and help to ensure the Internal Control objectives are achieved.\n\n## The Support Departments\n\nEach  member  of  the  Executive  Committee  is  entrusted  with worldwide responsibility for the Internal Control of the activities that  fall  within  their  remit.  The  Support  Departments  define, in  their  own  areas,  the  strategies,  policies  and  procedures which  they  communicate  to  the  countries  and  entities.  They bring their expertise to the operational divisions and review the proper  functioning  of  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility. They rely on their network of specialists or on regular audits.",

It  sets  the  operating  rules for all entities, defines and deploys tools, procedures and best practices,  particularly  in  terms  of  management,  accounting and consolidation, M&A, investments (BOLD corporate venture fund) and holdings, financing and cash, taxation, legal issues and  data  governance  (including  personal  data),  financial communication, strategic planning and insurance.\n\nAn  Internal  Control  Committee  has  the  task  of  taking  all measures  to  promote  the  proper  understanding  and  the proper  application  of  the  Group's  Internal  Control  rules  and also to monitor progress on important Internal Control projects. It is composed of the Chief Financial Officer, and the Directors of  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance,  Internal  Control,  Operational Finance, Internal Audit and Information Systems (Global IT).\n\n## Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department\n\nIn  particular,  this  Department  coordinates  the  procedures  for identifying, assessing  and  prioritising  risks with  all those concerned. It keeps the Group's risk mapping up to date. Its aim is to promote optimal use of resources in order to minimise and  control  the  impact  of  negative  events,  as  well  as maximise  opportunities.  The  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  &  Compliance Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## The Internal Control Department\n\nThis Department, which is separate from Internal Audit, is under the responsibility of the Ethics, Risk and  Compliance Department. In collaboration with the experts in each business line,  it  defines  and  updates  the  internal  control  framework relating to their area of activity. This framework is summarised in the 'Fundamentals of Internal Control' reference document and  detailed  in  standards  and  procedures  that  are  listed  in the Group's 'digital referential'.\n\nThe Internal Control Department also manages and develops a  network  of  around  170  regional  and  local  internal  control managers covering all Group entities. Their role is to apply the internal  control  framework  and  support  employees  in  this respect.  Frequent  participation  in  seminars,  training  cycles  or webinars  with  business  lines,  and  the  publication  of  notes  of engagement  help  to  strengthen  knowledge  of  the  internal control framework within the Group.\n\nWithin a continuous improvement process, the Internal Control Department develops, disseminates and coordinates self-evaluation  campaigns  focusing  on  the  main  risks  and issues  identified.  These  campaigns  are  gradually  being  rolled out in each of the business lines. The self-evaluation of Internal Control  makes  it  possible  for  the  Group's  entities  to  ensure the due and proper functioning of the system and reinforces it with operational actions.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Committee  is  driven  by  the  Internal Control  Department,  which  validates  directions  and  priorities with  regard  to  improving  the  internal  control  framework, developing the network of internal control managers and the tools  used  to  perform  internal  control  tasks.  This  Department monitors  changes  related  to  Internal  Control  relating  to expectations and market practices.\n\n## The Internal Audit Department\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  audits  major  processes  and checks on the application of Group principles and standards. It's  work is  carried out by a central team that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nInternal  Audit  assignments  are  submitted  to  the  General Management and the Audit Committee. With the approval of those  committees,  they  result  in  an  annual  audit  plan  that takes  account  of  the  Group's  risk  mapping,  the  entities' contributions to the Group's key economic indicators, and the historical precedence and results of previous audits.\n\nThe risk level assessment carried out by the Area Departments and experts in the different business lines is also a determining factor in the elaboration of the annual audit plan.",

        "page_content": "In 2022,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  carried  out  51 assignments, 26 of which involved entities (commercial entities, factories, international marketing departments, R&I) and 17 of which were on targeted processes at Group, Zone or Country level.  In  addition,  two  specific  assignments  were  devoted  to certain  objectives  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme, three  were  dedicated  to  the  management  of  key  projects and three were carried out on the cyber security programme.\n\nEach  audit  assignment  results  in  a  report  that  sets  out  the corresponding findings and risks, and that proposes an action plan and recommendations for the audited entity. The Internal Audit  Department  monitors  and  measures  these  action  plans, then reports the rate of progress to the Departments in question.\n\nTo  conduct  its  work,  Internal  Audit  relies  on  the  Group's integrated  ERP  software.  It  has  developed  a  number  of specific transactions to improve the identification of potential weaknesses  in  sensitive  processes.  Data  analysis  capabilities are  strengthened  each  year.  They  enhance  the  standard analyses  developed  by  Internal  Audit  and  the  use  of dashboards  and  analysis  tools  that  the  businesses  are continually developing for their own management needs.\n\nTo  carry  out  its  work,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  uses  an integrated  GRC  (Governance,  Risk,  Compliance)  tool,  which enables it to consolidate in real-time the progress made on the action  plans  of  audited  entities.  Shared  with  the  Internal Control function, this tool represents an integrated collaborative platform for the implementation of action plans.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  role  of  monitoring  the  application  of  the Internal Control system, the Internal Audit Department carries out  cross-functional  analyses  with  regard  to  possible  Internal Control  weaknesses  based  on  findings  noted  during  its assignments.  These  analyses  direct  the  work  of  the  Internal Control Committee  and  identify  the  priority  areas  for improvement and strengthening of procedures.\n\nThe achievement of the audit plan, the results of assignments and the progress of the action plans are presented to General Management on a regular basis and to the Audit Committee and the Statutory Auditors annually.\n\n## The Global IT Department\n\nThe  Group's  Global  IT  Department  determines  the  strategic orientations  of  its  IT  systems.  In  particular,  it  implements  ERP, a  management  software  which  is  used  by  the  vast  majority of the Group's commercial subsidiaries, factories and logistics services. It also supports the digital transformation of the Group by  developing  the  use  of  Cloud  services  (SaaS,  IaaS,  PaaS) and connected objects.\n\nWithin  the  Department,  the  Information  Systems  Security Department manages the Information Systems Security Policy. Consistent  with  market  standards  (ISO  27001/27002,  NIST),\n\nthis  policy  covers  the  main  topics  of  IT  security,  including the protection of personal data. It describes general principles to  be  applied  for  each  topic.  This  ensures  that  the  Group's Information  Systems  teams,  and  by  extension,  all  employees, share clear objectives, best practices and levels of control that are  appropriate  for  the  risks  (notably,  the  risk  of  cyber attacks).  This  policy  is  accompanied  by  an  independent information systems security audit programme and two codes of practice: the Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice, and the Code of Good Practice for the use of Social Media.\n\n## The Operations Department\n\nThis division comprises the Innovation, Product Packaging and Development,  Quality,  EHS  (Environment,  Health,  Safety), Production management and operational excellence, Purchasing,  Supply  Chain,  Information  Systems  (production) and industrial strategy departments. It defines the overall Operations  strategy  worldwide  and  defines  the standards  and  methods  applicable  in  the  areas  of  quality, safety and the environment for deployment in all the countries in which  the  Group  operates.  It  manages  the  Group's comprehensive  strategy  to  enable  the  Operations  teams in  the  operational  Divisions  and  the  Zones  to  implement innovation,  quality,  security,  environmental  manufacturing and supply chain policies that are relevant to the markets.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics,  buyers  have  had access to a practical and ethical guide, 'The Way We Work with  Suppliers',  since  2011.  This  guide  aims  to  help  all employees  in  their  relationships  with  the  Group's  suppliers. Buyers  also  complete  e-learning  modules  based  on  the Group's ' The Way We Compete '  and ' The Way We Prevent Corruption ' guides.\n\nThe  standard  for  managing  suppliers  and  tender  procedures specify  the  conditions  for  competitive  tendering  and  for  the registration  of  the  main  suppliers.  The  general  terms  of purchase form the framework for transactions with the suppliers. The 'Purchase Commitments  and  Order  Management' standard facilitates  and  strengthens  control  of  spending  and investments.\n\nIn  the  area  of  supply  chain,  the  main  tasks  are  to  define and  apply  the  sales  planning,  demand  management and  customer  service  development  and  control  processes. The methods used include managing physical order fulfilment, applying  the  general  terms  of  sale,  following-up  orders, managing customer returns and customer disputes, as well as accounts receivable collection procedures. Measures are also recommended  for  the  management  of  distribution  centres and inventories, subcontracting, product traceability, business continuity plans and transportation.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3. Preparing and processing accounting and financial information\n\nThis  section  is  based  on  the  'Application  Guide  for  Internal Control of accounting and financial information published by issuers',  from  the  Reference  Framework  published  by  the French  Financial  Markets  Authority  (AMF)  on  22  July  2010. It  is  part  of  an  overall  process  aimed  at  making  continual progress  and  improving  the  Internal  Control  system  that  is already in place.\n\n## 3.3.1. Definition, scope and objectives\n\nInternal  Control  for  accounting  and  finance  covers  the processes that provide accounting data, i.e. the processes for producing financial information, closing the accounts process and communication campaigns.\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  Internal  Control  process  is designed to ensure:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance  with  accounting  regulations  and  the  correct application  of  the  principles  on  which  the  financial statements are based;\n- \u00b7 application of the guidelines set by the General Management for financial information;\n- \u00b7 protection of assets;\n- \u00b7 quality of the reporting used to prepare published financial statements and reliability of their centralised processing for the  Group  for  their  distribution  and  use  for  monitoring purposes; and\n- \u00b7 control  of  the  production  of  financial,  accounting  and management information including fraud prevention.\n\nThe  scope  of  application  of  the  Internal  Control  procedures relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  financial  and accounting  information  encompasses  the  parent  company L'Or\u00e9al  and  all  subsidiaries  included  in  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.3.2. Monitoring process for the organisation of accounting and finance functions\n\n## Organisation of the Finance Departments\n\nUnder  the  supervision  of  General  Management,  dedicated teams  of  specialists  are  responsible  for  accounting  and financial  monitoring  in  the  following  areas:  accounting, consolidation,  tax  matters,  management,  financial  services and treasury.\n\nWithin the Administration and Finance Division, the Operational  Finance  Department  is  responsible  for  preparing the  Group's  consolidated  financial  results.  As  a  result,  it  also coordinates the Business Service Centre and a global network of  management  controllers  who  are  responsible  for  ensuring compliance with the accounting and management standards to  ensure  appropriate  management  of  the  Group's  results. In  addition,  an  expert  team  is  responsible  for  worldwide accounting  management,  ensuring  that  IFRS  standards  are applied,  and  that  the  Group's  accounting  processes  are implemented and harmonised worldwide and in the accounting Business Service Centre.\n\nFinally, the Operational Finance Department runs the Group's Tax  Department.  Comprising  a  network  of  tax  lawyers  at corporate  level,  in  the  Zones  and  in  the  Group's  most vulnerable  countries,  the  Tax  Department  monitors  changes in regulations,  ensures  compliance  with  local  rules,  and oversees the implementation of the Group's tax policy, and in particular the transfer pricing policy and customs rules.\n\nWithin the Administration and Finance Division, the Corporate Finance  Department  protects  the  Group's  financial  assets. The Treasury and Financing Department centralises cash flows and  the  hedging  of  currency  and  interest  rate  risks. The  department  leads  a  network  of  treasurers  in  the  Zones and countries, and applies the Group's financing policy.\n\nThe  Financial  Structure  Department  undertakes  external growth  transactions  and  monitors  the  financial  structures  of L'Or\u00e9al S.A. and its subsidiaries. The Business Opportunities for L'Or\u00e9al  Development  (BOLD)  corporate  venture  fund,  which makes  minority  investments  in  innovative  products  and companies,  is  also  managed  by  the  Corporate  Finance Department.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe Group has put in place accounting policies and standards that  are  consistent  with  IFRS,  the  consolidated  accounting standards.  All  consolidated  subsidiaries  must  apply  these standards  in  order  to  provide  uniform  and  reliable  financial information.\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  oversees  the  regular update  of  these  Group  standards,  taking  into  account  the changes in regulations and accounting principles.\n\nThese regulations define the principles required for harmonised accounting treatment of transactions, including the methods used to record balance sheet items and to identify and value off-balance  sheet  commitments.  The  Group's  Accounting Department  conducts  the  ongoing  monitoring  of  any  new accounting  standards  currently  under  preparation,  in  order to alert the General Management and anticipate their effects on the Group's financial statements.\n\nCommon to all subsidiaries, the chart of accounts, along with all  the  key  accounting processes, provide the definitions and methodology for preparing the reporting required to draw up the financial statements.\n\nThe management  standards  describe the operational application  of  these  rules.  They  give  the  valuation  rules  for some  of  the  key  balance  sheet  and  income  statement accounts  and  also  stipulate  the  controls  and  checks applicable to the key processes.\n\nThe management standards are regularly supplemented and are thus part of the continuous improvement process. This aims to  respond  to  the  findings  of  the  Internal  Audit  Department and  to  cover  the  accounting  and  financial  risks  of  the subsidiaries.  This  work  has  made  it  possible  to  bring  our approach more closely in line with the recommendations set out in the 'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of accounting and financial information' of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) Reference Framework.",

        "page_content": "## Organisation and security of information systems\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  and  the  Global  IT Department make joint decisions about the software suitable for the Group's financial and accounting requirements. At the level  of  information  systems,  the  teams  are  strengthening the  procedures  for  the  separation  of  tasks  and  improved control  of  access  rights.  They  have  been  offered  tools  to ensure that access rights comply with the Group's rules.\n\n## Management tools\n\nThe  system  for  monthly  reporting  on  economic  indicators enables  continuous,  uniform  monitoring  of  the  performance of  each  subsidiary  and  ensures  they  are  in  line  with  the objectives set.\n\nUsed  by  all  entities,  this  reporting  and  consolidation  system ensures  the  consistency  and  reliability  of  figures  at  the  level of  each  subsidiary  through  blocking  controls  that  operate before  the  financial  data  is  uploaded  to  Group  level.  In  this regard, the operating profit and loss account by destination, which  is  common  to  both  management  and  general accounting,  contributes  to  strengthening  the  control  of accounts  in  the  financial  statements,  as  a  single  reference framework is used.\n\nThe  Group's  organisation  is  based  on  reporting  from  each subsidiary  that  is  provided  directly  by  the  countries  to  the parent company, L'Or\u00e9al, without any intermediate aggregates for the vast majority of the subsidiaries. This system optimises  data  transfer  and  the  completeness  of  information and facilitates verification of data accuracy.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each subsidiary  make  a  joint  commitment  with  regard  to  the quality,  reliability  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  and financial  information  they  have  prepared  and  sent  to  the Group's Operational Finance Department, through a representation letter that they jointly sign.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  role  and  tasks  of  the  Audit  Committee,  as  previously described, comply with European regulations and, in particular, Directive 2014/56/EU and EU regulation 537/2014 on  statutory  audits,  and  are  based  on  the  report  by  the working group on Audit Committees published by the AMF on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.3.3. Processes used to prepare accounting and financial information\n\n## Operational processes contributing to accounting figures\n\nSpecific procedures  for  monitoring,  and  for  validation, authorisation and accounting rules apply to the processes that populate  the  financial  statements,  such  as  sales,  purchases, inventory  and  fixed  asset  management,  or  payroll  and  cash management.\n\n## Closing of accounts, consolidation and management reporting information\n\nThe closing of accounts is governed by precise instructions and a  detailed  time  schedule.  These  are  circulated  to  all subsidiaries to make sure that deadlines are met and financial statements  are  prepared  in  a  consistent  manner.  The  Group has  introduced  two  hard  closings  (anticipating  the  work involved  in  the  closure  of  financial  statements)  in  May  and November to prepare in advance and speed up closing times.\n\nFor  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements, validation procedures apply at each stage of the process of reporting and processing information. In particular, they verify that inter-company transactions have been correctly adjusted and  eliminated  (these  are  reported  on  a  monthly  basis), consolidation  transactions  have  been  checked,  accounting standards  have  been  correctly  applied,  the  consolidated published accounting  and  financial data have  been harmonised  and  properly  determined  and  the  general accounting  data  and  management  data  used  in  the preparation of the financial information are consistent.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nManagers  in  charge  of  Financial  Communication  prepare a precise timetable for publication of up-to-date information on the Group to the financial markets. This timetable complies with  the  requirements  of  market  authorities.  These  managers check  with  the  Legal  Department  that  communications comply with the required deadlines, laws and regulations.\n\nThey  also  have  a  role  in  ensuring  that  the  publication  of information provided by the Operational Finance Department is  precise  and  accurate.  All  material  information  provided  to the  financial  community  reflects  with  truth  and  transparency the situation and business activities of the Group. Furthermore, all communications  are  made  in  accordance  with  the principle of equal provision of information to all shareholders.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nAll accounting  and  financial  information  prepared  by consolidated  subsidiaries  is  subject  to  a  limited  review  at the  time  of  the  half-year  closing  process  and  to  a  full  audit at year-end by the external auditors. Twice a year, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the consolidated subsidiary make a joint commitment as to the fair presentation,  reliability  and  completeness  of  the  financial information by jointly signing a representation letter.\n\nAudit assignments in the countries are almost all entrusted to members of the networks of  the  two  Statutory  Auditors  who, after  having  jointly  performed  the  review  of  all  the  Group's accounts and the manner in which they were prepared, are responsible for issuing an opinion on the Group's consolidated financial  statements.  The  Statutory  Auditors  issue  an  opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent  company  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair view.  They  are  kept  informed  from  the  early  stages  of preparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  present  an overview of their work to the Group's accounting and finance managers  and  to  the  Audit  Committee  at  the  time  of  the half-year and annual closings.",

Insurance policy\n\n## The Group's general insurance policy\n\nThe  insurance  policy  aims  to  provide  the  best  protection  for the  Group's  assets  and  people  against  the  occurrence  of major  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  it.  The  Group  has implemented  group  insurance  programmes  (in  particular  for Property  Damage  &  Business  Interruption,  Third-Party  Liability, Cyber,  Transport,  Credit  Insurance  and  Construction)  that harmonise  coverage  and  optimise  insurance  cover  for  all its subsidiaries  throughout  the  world,  except  in  countries where regulations prohibits this type of arrangement (see  'Restrictions'  below).  Local  programmes  have  been  set up  in  the  countries  in  which  group  programmes  cannot  be deployed. This policy is applied as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at corporate level, the Group negotiates the structure and warranties of the group insurance programmes to cover its main exposures, in accordance with the offering available on the insurance market;\n- \u00b7 at  a  local  level,  local  policies  not  re-insured  by  a  group programme are deployed in coordination with the Group; and\n- \u00b7 in all cases, the subsidiaries must have mandatory insurance cover in order to comply with local regulations.\n\nThe  financial  solvency  of  insurers  is  an  important  selection criterion for the Group. Furthermore, the insurance programmes  subscribed  by  the  Group  mainly  involve coinsurance  between  the  various  major  players  in  the international insurance market.\n\n## Integrated group programmes\n\nGeneral civil liability :  this  group programme subscribed for all Group  subsidiaries  (except  where  local  Restrictions  apply) includes, in particular, civil operational liability, product liability and  damage  to  the  environment  that  is  sudden  and accidental.  It  covers  the  financial  consequences  of  the  civil liability of Group entities, if they are liable.\n\n## 3.4. Vigilance Plan\n\n## 3.4.1. Introduction\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  built  on  strong  Ethical  Principles  that  guide  its development: Integrity, Respect, Courage and Transparency. These  Principles  form  the  foundation  of  its  policies  on sustainable  development, corporate social responsibility,  and philanthropy.  L'Or\u00e9al  promotes  respect  for  all  internationally recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nIn  line  with  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business and Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al's particular point of reference is the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  rights,  and  the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance Plan (the 'Plan') meets the obligations of the French law of 27 March 2017 on the duty of vigilance for French parent companies  and  order-giver  companies. It  contains  reasonable  due  diligence  measures  intended  to prevent  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights\n\nProperty  damage  and  Business  Interruption :  this  programme provides  cover  for  fire,  lightning,  explosion,  theft  and  natural events  within  the  limits  of  the  products  available  on  the insurance market. The Group has set up a global programme to  cover  all  its  property,  chiefly  fixed  assets  and  inventories (except  where  Restrictions  apply).  This  cover  also  includes a  portion  on  business  interruption  directly  resulting  from covered  property  loss  or  damage.  As  the  capacity  of  the insurance  market  is  limited  for  certain  risks,  this  programme includes  sub-limits,  particularly  for  natural  events.  Through  its reinsurance  subsidiary,  the  Group  carries  risk  retention  levels that  are  not  material  at  consolidated  level,  and  these  are applicable  over  and  above  local  deductible  amounts.  The offering  includes  site  prevention  inspections  by  specialist departments of the leading insurer.\n\nCyber: a  cyber  insurance  policy  provides  financial  cover  for the consequences of IT-related risks, subject to exclusions and warranties available on the market. As it is a 'multi-risk' policy, cyber risk insurance comprises several components.\n\nTransport :  the  Group  has  set  up  an  insurance  programme to  cover  the  transportation  of  all  its  products.  Therefore, all  subsidiaries  benefit  from  appropriate  and  uniform  cover for  risks  related  to  the  Group's  logistical  operations  (except where Restrictions apply).\n\nCustomer  credit  risk: Group  subsidiaries  must  set  up  credit insurance,  assisted  by  the  Group  and  under  the  terms  and conditions  negotiated,  in  addition  to  their  own  credit management policy, provided that insurance cover compatible with their level of sales activity is available under financially acceptable conditions.\n\nBuildings: the  primary  aim  of  the  group  Buildings  insurance programme  is  to  standardise  the  conditions  of  cover  for  all projects, in all countries. It also makes it possible to disseminate a  general  Buildings  insurance  policy,  centralised  Corporate management and, lastly, warranty optimisation.\n\nand Fundamental Freedoms, health, as well as safety and the environment within the framework of a best efforts obligation. It  applies  to  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  Group, and  to  the  subsidiaries  controlled  directly  or  indirectly  by L'Or\u00e9al  (the  'Subsidiaries'),  as  defined  by  Article  L.  233-16  of the French Commercial  Code,  and  to  suppliers  and subcontractors with which the companies of the Group have an  'permanent  commercial  relationship',  that  is,  a  direct, ongoing  and  stable  commercial  relationship  based  on  the definition in French case law (the 'Suppliers'), depending on the risk level as identified in the Plan. It is understood that in its own activities, L'Or\u00e9al complies with the rules and diligences contained  in  the  Plan,  even  when  L'Or\u00e9al  is  not  expressly mentioned  therein.  The  Plan  contains  the  rules  applied  to prevent  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people and  the  environment  resulting  from  the  activities  of  L'Or\u00e9al, its Subsidiaries and Suppliers (see section 3.4.4.). It also includes reasonable  measures  for  the  effective  application  of  these rules by L'Or\u00e9al, its Subsidiaries and Suppliers as well as regular assessment procedures to evaluate their compliance",

It  provides  a  whistleblowing  mechanism and  reporting  system  (see  section  3.4.6.)  and  presents  a report  on  the  plan's  implementation  (see  section  3.4.7.). The  actions  to  support,  encourage  and  prevent  serious adverse  Human  Rights,  Fundamental  Freedoms,  health, safety  and  the  environment  contained  in  the  Plan  constitute reasonable  efforts  to  be  implemented  by  Suppliers  and Subsidiaries.  Given  the  diversity  of  the  businesses  of  the Subsidiaries and Suppliers, the Plan contains common measures for them.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  common  measures,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its Subsidiaries  voluntarily  conduct  additional  actions  on  these same issues. These initiatives are described in other chapters, in particular  chapter  4.  Suppliers  voluntarily  conduct  additional actions on these issues and L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to do so.\n\n## 3.4.2. A continuous improvement process\n\nAs  part  of  a  continuous  improvement  process,  the  Plan  is regularly  reviewed  by  a  committee  composed  of  the  Ethics, Risk  and  Compliance  Department,  the  Operations  Division (EHS,  Purchasing),  the  Human  Resources  Department,  the Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department  and  the  Legal Department.  It  meets  three  times  a  year.  Each  of  these representatives leads a local network (Ethics Correspondents, Environmental,  Health  and  Safety,  Purchasing,  and  Human Resource  teams,  managers  from  Internal  Control,  and Sustainability  Leaders)  around  the  world,  making  it  possible to take into account feedback from the field when improving the Plan.\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  was  presented  to  internal  stakeholders (such  as  the  employee  representatives  in  the  context  of  the European  Works  Council)  and  qualified  outside  stakeholders (NGOs and members of civil society). Its updated contents are presented  every  year  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  to  the Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.4.3. General framework of risk analysis\n\nThe risks of serious impacts on Human Rights, the environment, health  and  safety,  have  been  analysed  on  the  basis  of  the business  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  its  Suppliers.  The  risk analysis was used, first, in the definition of the applicable Rules and,  second,  to  the  measures  for  effective  application  and monitoring of these Rules.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  activity  consists  of  production  of  cosmetic  products and distribution of these products to the Group's clients.\n\n## A/ Manufacturing of finished products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al manufactures the vast majority of the finished products that  it  sells  in  its  own  factories,  with  a  presence  in  the  major growth  markets.  Its  network  of  38  factories  is  equipped  with the very latest technologies and advances in automation and adapts constantly, and with agility, to incorporate acquisitions and embrace external innovations.\n\nThis  network  is  completed  by  production  subcontracting, to  meet  temporary  demand  peaks  in  the  case  of  specific technologies (make-up pencils, soaps, etc.). L'Or\u00e9al's contracts prohibit cascade subcontracting. L'Or\u00e9al's consent must  be  obtained  by  subcontractors,  who  need,  as  result  of manufacturing  constraints,  to  subcontract  a  portion  of  their L'Or\u00e9al production. When, in certain cases, the subcontractor is authorised  to  subcontract  a  portion  of  its  production, the  same  rules  as  those  defined  in  this  Plan  are  applied  to the  subcontractors  of  the  subcontractors.  The  same  types of controls and  sanctions  are  in  place  in  the  event of non-compliance.\n\nIn order to execute their production, L'Or\u00e9al's factories purchase different  raw  materials,  filling  and  packing  components  and equipment  from  third-party  suppliers.  These  suppliers  have specific  expertise,  develop  their  products  and  have  the infrastructures  necessary  for  their  production.  They  act  with complete  independence  from  L'Or\u00e9al,  without  depending on L'Or\u00e9al's instructions or expertise.\n\nThe manufacture of filling and packing components is not part of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activity (1) .  The  filling  and  packing  components used are purchased from companies specialising in this area. The same is true for the production equipment.\n\n## B/ Product distribution\n\nProducts are distributed by the Subsidiaries and independent third-party  distributors  in  the  countries  or  regions  where  the Subsidiaries are not present.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  this  distribution,  warehouses  are  operated by  the  Subsidiaries  directly,  or  these  services  are  entrusted to  third-party  logistics  service  providers  that  render  services on  the  same  type  of  activity:  storage  and  preparation  of orders in warehouses that they lease or own.\n\n## 3.4.4. Applicable rules resulting from the risk analysis\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the applicable local  legislation  and  the  minimum  common core of the rules listed  below  (the  'Applicable  Rules')  in  order  to  prevent  the risk of serious adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights  and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment.  When  local  laws  and/or  the  internal  rules  of Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  provide  more  stringent  standards than  the  Applicable  Rules,  such  standards  must  take precedence.  If,  however,  the  Applicable  Rules  provide  for stricter  standards,  the  Applicable  Rules  take  precedence unless  they  result  in  an  unlawful  activity.  In  the  event  of contradictions between local laws and internationally recognised Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al works to comply with these international standards.",

Risks and Applicable Rules for the prevention of serious violations of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\n## Risk Analysis and risks identified relating to Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nThe Group expanded its mapping by identifying the potential key  Human  Rights  risks  worldwide  and  in  27  markets.  L'Or\u00e9al relied on the reporting framework of the Guiding Principles on Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP  Reporting  Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale and remediability, as well as the likelihood of its impacts for people  throughout  its  value  chain.  This  study  was conducted  with  an  NGO  specialised  in  the  area,  providing independent analysis.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  analysis,  the  following  salient  risks  were identified in the context of the application of the French Law on Duty of Vigilance:\n\n- \u00b7 the risk of child labour among the employees of the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  forced  labour  among  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  job  discrimination  because  of  gender,  age, disability,  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation  of  the employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employees  of  the  Group's Suppliers; and\n- (1) \u00b7 the risk of a lack of decent living wage for the employees of the Group's Suppliers.\n\nAnother  risk identified concerns  the  Human  Rights  of communities  potentially  impacted  by  the  Group's  activities (respect  for  the  environment,  right  of  access  to  water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials and,  in  particular,  the  right  of  access  of  local  populations to their land and respect for their traditional knowledge under the Nagoya Protocol).\n\n## Applicable rules on Human Rights\n\nSubsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the minimum core rules,  which  consist  of  the  following  rules  that  result  from  an analysis of the risks related to the activities of the Group and its Suppliers.\n\nNon-discrimination : Acts of discrimination are serious violations of  Human  Rights  that  remain  anchored  in  all  regions  of  the world  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al  is  present.  Discrimination  related  to gender,  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity,  disabilities, family  situation,  age,  political  and  philosophical  opinions, religious  beliefs,  union  activities,  or  related  to  ethnic,  social, cultural  or  national  origins  or  pregnancy  are  prohibited. L'Or\u00e9al  bans  pregnancy  testing  when  employees  are  hired within the Group, and requires its Suppliers to comply with this standard.\n\nBullying and sexual harassment : Bullying and sexual harassment are prohibited in the Group.\n\nChild labour : L'Or\u00e9al's presence in certain regions of the world that are particularly at risk for child labour, including Asia and Latin  America,  has  led  the  Group  to  identify  this  issue  as  a priority.\n\nTo  take  into  consideration  the  vulnerability  of  young  workers, L'Or\u00e9al has set the minimum hiring age at 16 years old.\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers are required to check the age of all new employees upon hire.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al prohibits night work and work hazardous to health and safety for employees younger than 18 in its Subsidiaries.\n\nForced or compulsory labour : L'Or\u00e9al refers to the definition of forced  labour  set  out  in  Convention  29  of  the  International Labour Organization: 'all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily'. In certain regions of the world where L'Or\u00e9al operates, certain practices that  violate  internationally  recognised  Human  Rights,  such  as holding the identity papers of migrant workers, are common. Any form of forced labour is prohibited. As a result:\n\n- \u00b7 unless  there  is  a  legal  obligation,  employees'  identity papers,  passports  or  any  other  personal  documents  may not be held from them. In the event of a legal obligation, these  documents  must  be  returned  to  employees  at  their first request;\n- \u00b7 employees may not be asked to pay for recruitment costs or to make cash deposits to obtain employment;\n- \u00b7 if workers from foreign regions are hired, the employer must pay the costs related to these hires;\n- \u00b7 the use of prison labour is possible only when it is voluntary within  the  scope  of  a  professional  reinsertion  programme, and  paid  at  the  market  rate.  Suppliers  must  request authorisation  from  L'Or\u00e9al  before  they  use  this  type  of labour;\n- \u00b7 security  personnel  must  only  ensure  the  safety  of  people and property; and\n- \u00b7 any salary withholding must be strictly authorised by law. It may not under any circumstances be used for the purpose of  confiscation,  for  the  direct  or  indirect  benefit  of  the employer.\n\nEmployees  must  have  access  to  drinking  water  and  toilet facilities.  They  must  be  free  to  move  around  their  place  of work, with the exception of areas to which access is restricted for confidentiality or safety reasons.\n\nWorking  hours :  Working  hours,  including  overtime,  may  not exceed 60 hours a week for employees whose working time is monitored.  All  employees  must  also  be  granted  at  least  one day  of  rest  for  every  seven-day  period,  or  two  consecutive days  of  rest  for  every  fourteen-day  period.  They  must  have reasonable breaks when they work.\n\nFreedom  of  association  and  right  to  collective  bargaining : Violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, such as discrimination against employee representatives, may occur in all regions of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nEmployees'  freedom  of  association  and  right  to  collective bargaining must be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 elections  of  employee  representatives  must  take  place without  interference  from  the  employer,  preferably  by secret ballot;\n- \u00b7 employee representatives have access to the work premises subject to safety and/or confidentiality requirements, if any; and\n- \u00b7 discrimination against employees conducting union activities is prohibited.\n\nIn  regions  where  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining  are  limited  or  discouraged,  L'Or\u00e9al authorises  its  employees  to  meet  independently  in  order  to discuss their professional concerns.",

        "page_content": "## Additional actions for Human Rights\n\nIn  addition  to  the  action  taken  as  a  result  of  the  risk  analysis conducted  on  the  business  activities  of  the  Group  and  its Suppliers,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts  initiatives  in  addition  to  those implemented  under  the  French  law  on  Duty  of  Vigilance. These are described in chapter 4.\n\nFor  example,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  actions  with  the  aim  to  improve the  working  conditions  of  the  Indian  communities  whose livelihood  depends  on  the  mineral  mica.  Since  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al has been one of the 20 founding members of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI). This year, the RMI has 82 members.\n\nThe RMI has three goals:\n\n- \u00b7 implement standards on the responsible workplace on 100% of the supply chains of its members for mica from Bihar and Jharkhand (standards on employment, health, safety in the workplace, the environment and non-use of child labour);\n- \u00b7 support  the  abilities  of  communities  through  an  inclusive programme  that  improves  the  standard  of  living  and generates additional sources of income; and\n- \u00b7 establish  a  legal  framework  and  related  control  systems with  mica  pickers,  processing  units,  and  mica  operators  in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also participates in the development of the RMI audit standard  in  order  to  facilitate  member  collaboration  and effectively deploy the collective actions necessary in cooperation  with  local  authorities.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  supports  the establishment  of  a  price  calculated  using  the  living  wage (1) approach in addition  to  diversified  income  contributing  to  a more resilient living conditions.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al requires  its  Suppliers  to  have  their  own  due  diligence processes  in  place  as  regards  their  own  scope  of  supply  of Indian mica. In 2021, 99% of Indian mica used in the Group's formulas  came  from  suppliers  committed  to  obtaining  their supply from verified sources.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  two  ambitious  programmes  aimed at  improving  working  conditions  for  the  employees  and communities  our  suppliers  use;  the  Living  Wage  programme and the Solidarity Sourcing programme.\n\n## Evaluation of the Human Rights Impact in the bergamot supply chain\n\nIn 2022, as part of L'Or\u00e9al's partnership with the Danish Institute for  Human  Rights,  the  latter  conducted  an  evaluation  of the human rights impact of the bergamot supply chain in the Calabria  region  of  Italy.  This  evaluation  aimed  to  ensure that  human rights  standards  are  observed  in  a  region  that  is affected by forced labour issues, particularly in the agricultural sector.  The  full  evaluation  report  has  been  published (2) and  it states that, despite the risks identified in the region, the practices of players in our supply chain are in compliance with human rights.\n\n## The Living Wage programme\n\nIn line with its commitment to fair pay for all of its employees, L'Or\u00e9al  aims  to  ensure  that,  by  2030,  all  employees  of  its strategic  suppliers  will  be  paid  at  least  a  living  wage,  in  line with best practices.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is supported by the Fair Wage Network, a rigorous and internationally recognised NGO.\n\nVigilance Plan\n\nIn order to roll out this approach to our strategic suppliers, we initiate dialogue,  work  together  and  establish  common strategic frameworks, in collaboration with partners within our supply  chains,  other  companies,  civil  society,  governments, etc.\n\nIn  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  pilot  programme  that  included about  20  of  its  strategic  suppliers,  who  were  selected  to represent different purchasing categories and various geographic areas. The aim of the programme was to explore the principle of a decent living wage and to help them look at gaps and the potential obstacles to implementation. The pilot consisted  of  a  series  of  regular  meetings  with  the  assistance of the Fair Wage Network.\n\n## The Solidarity Sourcing programme\n\nThrough its Solidarity Sourcing programme, established in 2010, due to its many industrial and administrative sites all over the world, L'Or\u00e9al  is heavily involved  in  the  life of local communities in the areas neighbouring its sites and suppliers.\n\nThe programme aims to use the Group's purchasing power to serve  social  inclusion  by  dedicating  part  of  its  purchases  to suppliers providing access to work and a sustainable income for  people  who  are  generally  excluded  from  the  labour market, economically vulnerable communities, including small businesses  and  those  that  have  trouble  accessing  major contractors.\n\nThe programme concerns all the Group's suppliers and values their  commitment  to  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion.  The Solidarity  Sourcing programme  concerns,  for  example:  fair trade  producers,  companies  which  employ  people  with disabilities, social insertion enterprises, or companies owned by minorities (when this is permitted by national legislation).\n\nAs part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group is renewing its goal to  enable  over  100,000  people  from  underprivileged  or  poor communities to find work by 2030.\n\n## 3.4.4.2. Risks and Applicable Rules to prevent serious adverse impacts on Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\n## Analysis of Risks to Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\nThe  risk  analysis  covers  generic  risks  related  to  industrial activities and  specific risks related to Suppliers' and Subsidiaries' own business activities.\n\n## Generic risk analysis process\n\nAs  is  the  case  for  any  production  (manufacturing  and packing),  distribution,  research  and  general  administration operations, the Group and its Suppliers are exposed to safety and environmental challenges.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work on the Environment, Health and Safety at the workplace carried out by L'Or\u00e9al for many years, the major risks below have been identified. On this basis, the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  define  at  each  of  their sites,  the  measures  designed  to  prevent  the  risks  identified in the Plan (the 'Prevention System').",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Subsidiaries\n\nThe Subsidiaries  conduct their own risk analysis based on the list of risks set out below, particularly the fire risk is controlled by very  strict  fire  prevention  standards  (such  as  those  issued  by the National Fire Protection Association).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  generic  risks,  the  Subsidiaries  identify  the specific  risks  related  in  particular  to  cosmetics  production. For  example,  the  physical  risks  are  the  subject  of  SHAP (Safety Hazards Assessment Procedure) studies, which identify the  dangers,  generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the risks  and  allow  the  implementation  of  the  necessary  means of  control.  Environmental  risks  are  also  analysed  to  assess the nature of the aspects and impacts of a site's activities on its  environment  and  to  control  any  that  lead  to  potentially serious  impacts  for  the  air,  soil,  water,  biodiversity  and resources.\n\nThis environmental analysis is updated regularly by each of the Group  Subsidiaries'  sites  and  whenever  a  significant  change takes  place.  If  significant  risks  are  identified  or  if  L'Or\u00e9al's standards or regulations impose specific requirements, a more detailed evaluation is carried out for the activities concerned. Appropriate  action  plans  -  with  immediate  action  where necessary - are implemented to reduce significant risks to an acceptable level.\n\nWith  regard  to  water  discharge,  each  industrial  site  has implemented  a  self-monitoring  system  representative  of  the wastewater  discharged (1) . This  self-monitoring  is  a  tool  for detecting  risks  of  exceeding  regulatory  thresholds  that  helps to  anticipate  any  non-conformities  and  initiate  corrective actions.  31  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  have  their  own  wastewater treatment plant and L'Or\u00e9al is continuing with the installation of these plants.\n\nThe process safety risks are analysed using the HAZOP (HAZard and  OPerability  analysis)  guide.  This  method  focuses  on operating conditions, or FMECA (2) ,  which analyses risks related to failures in the process at the different steps in production.\n\nThe results and means of controlling industrial and specific risks are  summarised  in  the  GHAP  (Global  Hazard  Assessment Procedure) programme.\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Suppliers\n\nIn addition to their own risk analysis, Suppliers rely, at the very least,  on  the  risks  listed  in  the  audit  grid  provided  by  L'Or\u00e9al when  the  Letter  of  Mutual  Ethical  Commitment  is  signed (see section 4.3.1.2.1.) to implement the appropriate prevention measures  at  each  affected  site.  This  grid  was  prepared  in accordance  with  the  list  of  the  major  risks  described  below and is applied during referencing and follow-up audits.\n\nIf the  specific  nature  of  the  Suppliers'  activity  requires identification  of  specific  risks  and/or  additional  prevention measures, the Suppliers are required to roll out these additional measures in accordance with best practices in their industry.\n\nFor  example,  in  the  subcontracting  of  finished  products activity,  specific  risks  may  involve  (i)  the  use  of  certain  raw materials,  (ii)  wastewater  treatment,  (iii)  the  use  of  machines or  electrical  equipment  in  processing  or  storage  areas, and (iv) handling techniques that may cause personal injury, in particular.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  subcontracting  suppliers  of  aerosol production or storage, bleaching powders, flammable products,  the  sites  are  subject  to  specific  risks  analyses concerning process safety.\n\n## Risks identified in the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n## Risks of serious adverse impacts to Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n- (i) Risks associated with buildings and the use of equipment:\n- \u00b7 soundness  of  buildings  (construction  and  interior  fittings, including  the  compliance  of  equipment  with  operating authorisations  and  building  permits  issued  by  local authorities  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  legislation and,  in  any  event,  adaptation  to  the  activity  for  which the buildings are intended);\n- \u00b7 use  of  motorised  forklift  trucks  and  Automatic  Guided Vehicles (AGV): risks caused by interactions and interference between forklift trucks, AGVs and pedestrians; and\n- \u00b7 injuries  caused  by  interactions  between  humans  and machines: risks related to access to the moving parts of work equipment.\n- (ii) Risks related to energy sources, matter and materials:\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  energy  sources,  fluids  and  hazardous emissions  including  electricity,  high  pressure,  steam, vapour, hot water and high temperatures;\n- \u00b7 fires  resulting,  notably,  from  flammable  products  and materials or electrical equipment;\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  hazardous  dust  and  chemical  products: by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to high noise levels.\n- (iii) Risks related to human activities:\n- \u00b7 entry in confined spaces and/or the risk of anoxia;\n- \u00b7 isolated work: risks associated with working alone for long periods of time;\n- \u00b7 slipping and falls;\n- \u00b7 ergonomics of workstations related to load handling;\n- \u00b7 construction  works  (risks  during  construction  activities); and\n- \u00b7 work  at  heights  (risk  of  falls  associated  with  the  use  of ladders and step stools, access to and work on platforms and roofs, use of lift tables and scaffolding, etc.).\n\n## Environmental risks\n\nThe  risks  of  serious  damage  to  the  environment  are  those associated  with  the  consumption  of  resources  or  that  could cause  damage  to  soils,  water,  air  and  biodiversity  (habitats and  species)  in  the  context  of  normal  operation  or  the occurrence  of  an  incident  at  a  site  of  the  Subsidiaries  or Suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 gradual or accidental pollution; and\n- \u00b7 pollution during the transport of hazardous materials.",

For the Subsidiaries, this policy is built on an  EHS  management  system  composed  of  standards  with stringent  requirements  that  set  the  principles  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS policy, which is all included in the EHS guidelines.\n\n## Additional Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace actions\n\nIn  addition  to  the  action  taken  as  a  result  of  the  risk  analysis conducted  on  the  business  activities  of  the  Group  and  its Suppliers, L'Or\u00e9al conducts Environmental Health and Safety in the  Workplace  initiatives  in  addition  to  those  implemented under  the  French  law  on  Duty  of  Vigilance.  These  are described in chapter 4.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  in the  workplace  is  supported  at  the  highest  level  of  the Company by its Chief Executive Officer who renews L'Or\u00e9al's commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  each year.\n\nFor example, this includes the following additional actions and commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 in  2015, L'Or\u00e9al was one of 100 leading companies to join the Science Based Targets programme;\n- \u00b7 in  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  became a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation:  with  Act4Nature,  in  the  context  of  individual commitments, L'Or\u00e9al set biodiversity objectives for 2030;\n- \u00b7 in  2019, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the first companies to sign the Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C  pledge  of  the  UN  Global Compact, thereby committing to reach 'net zero emissions' by 2050 over its entire value chain, in accordance with the 1.5\u00b0C path of the IPCC; and\n- \u00b7 in 2020, L'Or\u00e9al became a signatory of the TCFD.\n\n## (i) Additional actions intended for Sites of Subsidiaries\n\nAt  its  own  sites,  L'Or\u00e9al  implements  the  LIFE  (Life  threatening Incident or Fatality Event) programme, which covers activities on all its sites that, if not controlled, could result in potentially serious  injury  and  illness.  The  Group  extends  the  ambition of moving  towards  'zero  accidents'  by  ensuring  the sustainability of actions and defining post-incident emergency preparedness requirements.\n\nThe Sharing Beauty with All programme has helped to reduce the environmental footprint of the Group's sites: between 2005 and 2020, our factories and distribution centres reduced their CO2  emissions  by  -81%  (in  absolute  value),  their  water withdrawal by -49% (1) , and their waste generation by -37% (1) .\n\nThe commitments made by the Group for 2030 as part of its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  are  aimed  at  ensuring compatibility  of  the  Group's  activities  with  a  planet  that  has limited  resources (2) .  The  main  environmental  objectives  of  the programme concerning Subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n- (3) \u00b7 climate: reaching 'carbon neutral'  status for all operated sites  by  2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and  using 100%  renewable  energy.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  also  committed  to halving the transport footprint of its products by 2030;\n- \u00b7 water:  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be recycled and reused in a loop;\n- \u00b7 biodiversity:  by  2030,  all  of  our  operated  buildings  and  all industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared  to  2019.  A  methodology  for  monitoring  the Biodiversity commitment was developed in 2021 and rolled out to all of the Group's sites in 2022. Becoming 'biodiversity net  positive'  is  achieved  by  meeting  two  conditions:  the first is improving the potential for hosting biodiversity on the Group's  sites, the second  concerns  developing  the biodiversity culture of employees;\n- \u00b7 natural resources: by 2030, 100% of the waste generated in our operated sites will be recycled or reused. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to no longer send waste to landfill.\n\nThese  objectives  are  accompanied  by  monthly  reporting  of detailed indicators used to monitor evolutions in results in each of  these  areas  and  to  identify  potential  anomalies  and incidents.\n\nThe Group  is engaged  in  a  process of continuous improvement  of  its  EHS  performance  through  a  programme to  achieve  ISO  certification  for  its  operated  sites,  in  order to  anchor  the  EHS  policy  in  the  long  term:  ISO  45001  for  the management of employee health and safety and improvement  in  their  working  conditions;  ISO  14001  for  the management  of  environmental  impacts  and  improvement in  environmental  performance;  and  ISO  50001  for  energy management and energy performance improvement.\n\n'Culture'  audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS  specialists to assess the degree to which EHS culture has been rolled out to all Subsidiary employees. The results of these audits provide information  on  the  level  of  knowledge  of  EHS  management tools and the maturity of audited sites with regard to the safety and environment culture at all levels of the hierarchy.\n\nDetailed  information  on  these  additional  actions  is  available in chapter 4.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\n## (ii) Additional actions intended for Suppliers\n\nThe Purchasing teams select the most competitive suppliersand  in  accordance  with  the  responsible  purchasing policy.  Suppliers'  EHS  assessment  is  managed  by  monitoring indicators  included  in  the  corporate  social  responsibility criterion, which is one of the five criteria for monitoring supplier performance.\n\nAs  part  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  launched in  2020  with  targets  for  2030,  the  Group  has  broadened its  environmental  commitments  to  its  supply  chain.  The  main environmental  objectives  of  the  programme  concerning suppliers or those that may be related to their business activity are therefore as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate: by 2030, strategic suppliers will reduce their direct greenhouse  gas  emissions  (scopes  1  and  2)  by  50%  in absolute terms compared to 2016.\n- \u00b7 Water:  by  2030,  all  strategic  suppliers  will  use  water responsibly in the areas where they operate.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity:\n- \u00b7 By 2030, 100% of the biobased ingredients for the Group's formulas and packaging materials will be traceable and will  come  from  sustainable  sources,  with  none  linked  to deforestation.\n- \u00b7 By  2030,  the  footprint  on  the  ecosystems  vital  to  the sourcing  of  its  ingredients  will  be  maintained  at  2019 levels.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable sourcing of raw materials:\n\nFor  the  palm  oil  and  its  by-products  segment,  for  which specific 'Zero deforestation' status was achieved at the end of  2020,  100%  of  the  supplies  were  covered  by  action  plans with the suppliers concerned.  L'Or\u00e9al developed  the Sustainable  Palm  Index  (SPI),  a  tool  to  evaluate  and  select suppliers of palm oil and palm kernel derivatives to assess the level of commitment, progress and achievements of its direct suppliers  in  favour  of  sustainable  palm  oil.  This  tool  is  used annually  to  evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  Zero Deforestation objective and their level of compliance with the Group's requirements.\n\nThe  specific  feature  of  the  SPI  lies  in  its  integration  in  the purchasing decision process. A supplier in compliance with the SPI  will  benefit  from  an  allocation  of  volumes,  long-term contracts, and will be favoured in the context of partnerships in land projects.\n\nIn 2019, L'Or\u00e9al co-founded  the  collective  Action  for Sustainable  Derivatives  initiative  in  order  to  share  knowledge and  methods  with  other  operators  to  encourage  the production  and  responsible  supply  of  palm  oil  derivatives. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to managing, preserving and rehabilitating forests, prioritising forestry ecosystems that are of primary strategic interest to the Group. The Group has drawn up a Forestry Policy for 2030, which enshrines its ambition and sets out the objectives associated with the sustainable supply of forest-based materials.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  ensures  compliance  among  its  direct  and  indirect suppliers  by  applying  due  diligence  procedures,  including  a geospatial monitoring tool, community monitoring and checks\n\nconducted by a third party. Nusantara Atlas is used to carry out  risk  assessments  at  province  and  district  level,  and  the Global Forest Watch Palm Risk Tool is used to conduct them at plant  level.  Since  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  working  with  the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Transitions to develop a new  add-on  for  the  SPOTT  platform  to  assess  the  level  to which  mills  and  refineries  comply  with  the  NDPE  (No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation) (1) principles. For its projects  involving  small  operators  in  Indonesia,  L'Or\u00e9al  uses specific deforestation surveillance systems to ensure compliance  with  NDPE.  Furthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  continually monitors complaints made throughout its supply chain using a 'palm alert procedure'.\n\nFor other streams of renewable raw materials, which represent 22%  of  the  portfolio  of  renewable  raw  materials  in  volume and 86% in number, L'Or\u00e9al has defined 'sustainable sourcing challenges' indicators to assess the sustainability of renewable raw  material  streams.  These  indicators  were  defined  using environmental, social and economic indicators from external databases (2) .\n\nThese indicators are consolidated within the SCAN (Sustainable  Characterisation)  index,  allowing  the  Group  to prioritise the implementation of its sustainable sourcing action plans. The Group updates the information collected regularly. 71% of the volume of raw materials that the SCAN index has identified as representing sustainable sourcing challenges (i.e. 45% of the number of raw materials) are already the subject of plans or improvement initiatives with the relevant suppliers to ensure sustainable supply. The goal is for 100% of the Group's renewable raw materials to come from sustainable sources.\n\nTo  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  support  and  training programme  for  more  than  200  suppliers  on  the  issues  of sustainable sourcing of raw materials in order to guarantee the traceability  of  the  raw  materials  delivered  to  L'Or\u00e9al  and ensure the associated streams are secure. Depending on the level  of  environmental  and/or  social  risk  identified  on  these streams,  suppliers  are  asked  to  deploy  the  field  audit procedure  for  producers  (88  indicators).  This  procedure  was developed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  with  the  support  of  the  Rainforest Alliance  NGO  and  reviewed  in  2019  by  EcoCert,  The Biodiversity  Consultancy  and  The  Danish  Institute  for  Human Rights.  They  are  also  invited  to  rely  on  sustainable  sourcing certifications  adapted  to  the  challenges  of  their  streams (Fair Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic, etc.).\n\n- \u00b7 Plastics and advertising displays:\n- \u00b7 By  2030,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be recycled or bio-sourced (target of 50% by 2025).\n- \u00b7 By  2025,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n- \u00b7 By 2025, 100% of the Group's advertising displays at points of  sale  will  be  eco-designed,  taking  into  account  the principles  of  the  circular  economy  for  managing  their end of life.\n- \u00b7 Commitment of  suppliers  to  self-assess  and  move  forward with action plans through the CDP.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al actively works with its suppliers to help them improve their performance in terms of sustainable development.",

        "page_content": "In  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  CDP  supply  chain  programme  for greater  transparency  in  the  actions  of  its  suppliers  and  to monitor the progress made in relation to L'Or\u00e9al's objectives. In  2014,  participation  in  the  CDP  Climate  programme  was made compulsory by L'Or\u00e9al for all strategic suppliers. The aim is to  measure  and  report  their  emissions,  set  targets  for reducing these emissions and communicate their action plans to achieve this objective successfully. In 2022, 94% of strategic suppliers completed  the  climate  questionnaire.  90%  of selected  suppliers  completed  the  water  questionnaire  and 87%  of  those  selected  for  the  sustainable  management  of forestry questionnaire responded.\n\n- \u00b7 Supplier  commitment  to  self-assess  and  improve  with corrective actions implemented by EcoVadis:\n\nBy participating in the EcoVadis assessment, L'Or\u00e9al compares its environmental and social policy with the expertise and the recommendations of external auditors qualified in the analysis of  multi-sector  risks.  This  is  a  useful  rating  for  the  continuous improvement  of  suppliers  and  it  also  contributes  to  the transparency  of  industry  practices.  This  assessment  is  used  to select  suppliers  by  taking  their  environmental  and  social performance  into  consideration.  94%  of  strategic  suppliers were evaluated by EcoVadis.\n\n## 3.4.5. Effective application and compliance with the Plan\n\nThe Plan includes effective application measures intended to ensure  the  correct  implementation  of  the  Applicable  Rules by  the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers.  Monitoring  of  compliance with  the  Plan  is  carried  out  through  audits  and  analyses performed  by  external  service  providers  or  by  Group  teams. The  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  are  asked  to  carry  out self-assessments.\n\n## 3.4.5.1. Effective application of the Plan\n\n## Adoption of Applicable Rules\n\n- (i) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries\n\nThe effective implementation of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries  is  achieved  through  their  incorporation  in  the Group's Internal  Rules.  For  this  purpose,  compliance  with  the effective application of the Plan is based on control activities in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n\nThe communication of Applicable Rules to Group employees is described below.\n\n- (ii) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\nSuppliers undertake to comply with the Applicable Rules. The principal Suppliers sign the Letter of Ethical Commitment that covers  these  applicable  Rules.  Moreover,  the  Suppliers  that could present the most significant risks because of their activity or  geographic  location  may  be  audited  on  these  issues  in accordance  with  the  Risk  Matrix.  The  contents  of  the  points that will be audited is set forth in the letter.\n\n## Governance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people in the workplace and the environment is supported at the highest level of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer who renews L'Or\u00e9al's commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  each year. These commitments are also set out in the Group's Code of Ethics and the Human Rights and Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\n## (i) Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms governance\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  a  member  of  the Executive Committee, is responsible for overseeing the respect of  Human  Rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  in  the  Group. This  mission  has  been  entrusted  to  her  by  L'Or\u00e9al's  Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports.\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  has  a  budget  and a  dedicated team of Human Rights experts. She relies on all the Group's teams and resources to carry out her work.\n\nA  dedicated  network  of  Human  Rights  Correspondents covering  all  of  the  Group's  markets  allows  the  Group's commitments in terms of Human Rights to be rolled out.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee, chaired by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and composed of representatives of the various  activities,  functions  and  geographic  areas  (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security, etc.), allows coordination and exchange on the implementation of the Group's Human Rights policy. Its primary objective is to enable the emergence of a Human Rights culture within the Group.\n\nCountry  Managers  (or,  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report)  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Human Resources teams are responsible for ensuring that the  activities  of  the  Subsidiaries  respect  employees'  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nEmployees may contact their manager, their Human Resources Director,  their  Legal  Director,  their  Purchasing  Director,  their Human  Rights  Correspondent,  their  Ethics  Correspondent  and, ultimately,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer  if  they have any questions about compliance with the Applicable Rules.\n\nThe  Purchasing  teams  ensure  that  Supplier  activities  respect Human Rights and fundamental freedoms. Suppliers included in  the  Risk  Matrix  are  not  listed  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  Supplier  database until  they  have  contractually  committed  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules. Purchasing teams discuss, during Management Committee meetings that include representatives from all Zones and purchasing areas, the results of audits, their consequences for  commercial  relations,  and  the  related  actions  plans  to achieve  continuous  improvement  of  results  at  the  Group's Suppliers.",

Employees must be reminded of the Code of Ethics and its contents on a regular basis.\n\nAny employee in contact with Suppliers must receive the 'The Way We Work with our Suppliers' guide when they are hired. It explains ethical standards that apply to Supplier relations.\n\nAn Ethics Intranet site is available to employees.\n\nAn annual Ethics Day, including Human Rights, has been held since 2009. This day enables employees to discuss matters such as respect for Human Rights and fundamental freedoms via a livestream with L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer and the other members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  Discussions  on  ethics are  also  organised  in  the  Subsidiaries  to  let  employees exchange  conversations  with  their  Subsidiary's General Manager.\n\nIn 2022, nearly 35,000 people logged on to Ethics Day sessions and more than 7,600 questions were asked worldwide.\n\nWith  respect  to  Suppliers,  in  addition  to  the  communication of  Applicable  Rules  via  the  letters  of  ethical  commitment, they are given access to the following documents (1) :\n\n- \u00b7 the Code of Ethics; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's  policy  on  Suppliers/subcontractors  and  child labour.\n\n## (ii) Training on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nA  specific,  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics  covers Human Rights and fundamental freedoms issues.\n\nNew  buyers  receive  compulsory  training  on  Responsible Purchasing  to  learn  about  how  to  ensure  respect  of  the Group's Ethical Principles.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  on  Supplier  audits,  detailing  the applicable  audit  procedure,  is  also  available  for  all  buyers. A  Suppliers  version  is  available  on  the  same  website  as  the above information.

They constitute one of the cornerstones in the implementation  of risk identification and  management systems,  and  the  deployment  of  the  EHS  culture  in  all  Group entities.\n\nEHS training includes the various training actions for health and safety  in  the  workplace,  or  the  environment  and  covers general  EHS  training,  EHS  training  by m\u00e9tier and  specific  EHS training.\n\nGeneral EHS training includes:\n\n- \u00b7 core general training completed, for example, when a new employee arrives at a Site (L'Or\u00e9al employee or temporary staff) regardless of their position; and\n- \u00b7 fire  safety  training,  first  aid,  pollution  prevention,  recycling, general EHS awareness raising, etc.\n\nEHS  training  by m\u00e9tier refers  to  training  specific  to  a  given m\u00e9tier  area  or  activity  (for  example,  all  of  the  filling  and packing staff of a factory).\n\nSpecific  EHS  training  refers  to  EHS  training  for  a  particular workstation and the activities carried out by the employee.\n\nIn terms of ergonomics, a 'Manual handling' e-learning course is provided to all employees.\n\nA  high  level  of  expertise  for  global  EHS  Teams  and  the development of an EHS culture for 'Top managers', managers and  supervisors  is  assured  via  the  deployment  of  training specific to each person.\n\nTo  support  the  Environmental  aspect  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future  programme, a  training  programme  on  the  challenges related  to  climate,  water,  biodiversity  and  resources (Green steps for all )  has been launched with the intention of training 100% of the Group's employees.\n\n## 3.4.5.2. Monitoring compliance with the Plan\n\n## Risk hierarchy of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules\n\nThe risk hierarchy is used to enhance controls on compliance with the Applicable  Rules  by  defining  procedures  for monitoring compliance with the Rules that are consistent with the risks, including via a policy of third-party audits, monitoring and  evaluation  of  Suppliers conducted  by  third-party companies  such  as  EcoVadis.  The  Group's  vigilance  is strengthened  in  circumstances  where  conflict  is  involved, in line with applicable international standards.\n\nAs  far  as  Subsidiaries  are  concerned,  the  risk  hierarchy  of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules was created taking into  account  the  type  of  activity  and,  thereafter,  the  type of Site (1) .\n\nWith respect to the Suppliers, the risk mapping  of non-compliance  with  the  Applicable  Rules  was  created  for Human  Rights,  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  environment, and health and safety in the workplace using a methodology that takes the following parameters into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The  country  in  which  the  Supplier's  sites  are  located: a country is considered vulnerable in terms of Human Rights and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  and  environment,  health and safety, if it meets at least one of the following criteria:\n- 1.  The  country  is  classified  as  'High  risk'  or  'Extreme  risk' according  to  the  criteria  of  the  consultancy  firm  Verisk Maplecroft: 12 evaluation indices are used in this methodology and aggregated in a single grade compared with the threshold values set by Verisk Maplecroft; and\n- 2.  The  results  of  social  audits  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  the country include cases of Zero Tolerance or Need Immediate  Action  ('NIA'  rating  that  corresponds  to  the most severe non-conformities).\n- \u00b7 The  business  sector:  each  Supplier  is  associated  with  a sector  area  according  to  a  governance  ranking  of Purchases ('Global Purchasing Categories').\n- \u00b7 The  nature  of  operations:  the  activities  most  heavily exposed  to  labour  risk  are  the  activities  with  high  manual added value, implying work on a production line.",

Audits are done by specialist external companies. When a Subsidiary or Supplier  is  audited,  the  process  is  carried  out  in  accordance with  the  Risk  Matrix  set  out  above.  A  written  audit  report is  prepared.  With  respect  to  the  Subsidiaries,  the  reports  are stored  in  a  secure  database  available  to  Group  Human Resources Directors and to the Country Operations Directors, in some cases. The reports on Suppliers are intended for Group buyers.\n\nEHS  audits  specific  to  Subsidiaries: In order  to  ensure compliance  with  the  Group's  EHS  policy,  a  system  of worldwide  audits  has  been  in  place  since  1996,  and  was reinforced in 2001 with the presence of external auditors. These are  experts  in  the  local  environment  and  regulations.  These audits  take  place  regularly  on  each  L'Or\u00e9al  site:  every  three years for production sites and every four years for distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres. If the result of  the  audit  does  not  meet  the  standard  required  by  the L'Or\u00e9al guidelines, a specific interim audit is scheduled for the following  year.  Every  year,  the  teams  responsible  for  EHS  risks review  the  audit  results  and  identify  general  improvement plans.  The  improvement  plans  specific  to  the  audited  Sites are  established  immediately  after  the  end  of  the  audit. Any emergency measure intended to prevent an imminent risk for the health of persons at the Site is implemented by the Site EHS teams without waiting for the completion of an audit even if it  is  not  part  of  the  improvement  plan  that  may  exist. There  are  various  audit  grids  called  'risk',  'culture',  or 'combined risk and culture', used depending on the maturity and type of activity at the Sites. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of practices and facilities with the Group's rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 progress in terms of EHS performance;\n- \u00b7 any risks that the sites may present from an EHS standpoint; and\n- \u00b7 the  level  of  management  and  deployment  of  EHS  culture on the Sites.\n\nEach risk finding is classified in one of three categories A, B and C  according  to  a  matrix  of  level  of  impact/probability  of occurrence. 'A' findings are monitored monthly and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\nThe monthly reporting of safety and environmental data also enables  consolidation  and  analysis  of  any  anomalies  and incidents  leading  to  regulatory  non-conformity,  complaints and/or fines.\n\n## Three types of audit specific to Suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 initial audits: first audits conducted, which are a prerequisite to the start of the relationship with a new Supplier;\n- \u00b7 follow-up  audits:  audits  done  12  to  24  months  maximum after the immediate improvement request (Needs Immediate Action or NIA), depending on the severity of the non-conformities found; and\n- \u00b7 confirmation audits, three years after the initial audit.\n\n## The possible outcomes of the audits are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Satisfactory :  all  criteria  conform  to  the  Applicable  Rules and the best practices are highlighted;\n- \u00b7 Needs Continuous Improvement (NCI) : minor non-conformities were found, but they do not have an impact on employee safety or health;\n- \u00b7 Needs  Immediate  Action  (NIA):  non-conformities  are reported  either  because  they  are  serious,  because  they are recurring or have a potential impact on the health and safety of employees;\n- \u00b7 Zero Tolerance (ZT) :  reported, for example, in the event of a  critical  non-conformity  because  of  child  labour,  forced labour,  physical  abuse,  restricted  freedom  of  movement, an immediate risk of accident for employees or attempted bribery of the auditors (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 Access  Denied : reported  when  the  audit  is  refused (for example in the event of refusal to provide partial or full site access to the auditors).\n\nIn the event  of  a  non-conformity  (Needs  Continuous Improvement,  Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance), corrective action plans must be implemented which are then audited  at  the  level  of  the  Subsidiary  or  Supplier.  Failure to  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  can,  in  the  case  of a  Subsidiary,  result  in  an  alert  being  sent  to  the  Country Manager.  Subsidiaries  can  decide  to  link  part  or  all  of  the remuneration of their managers and/or of their performance evaluation to the implementation of the Applicable Rules.\n\nIn  the  case  of  Suppliers,  serious  non-conformities  (Needs Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance  and  Access  Denied) or the failure to implement corrective action can result in the non-listing  of  a  new  Supplier  or  the  suspension  or  termination of commercial relations with a listed Supplier.\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can  be initiated.  Visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the  process  of routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result,  if  necessary, in additional audits.\n\n## Specific EHS audits of subcontractors' sites\n\nAdditional specific EHS audits are conducted by independent third  parties  for  subcontractor  sites  for  aerosol  production  or storage,  bleaching  powders,  flammable  products  under  the criteria  defined  by  L'Or\u00e9al,  which  are  similar  to  those  used for  the  Group's  sites.  These  audits  are  triggered  at  the  time of  referencing/qualification  and  are  followed  up  via  audits conducted  between  12  months  and  36  months  maximum after  the  immediate  improvement  request  (NIA),  depending on  the  severity  of  the  non-conformities  found,  and  again at the time of confirmation, five years after the initial audit.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  are  the  same  type  as  those previously described: satisfactory, NCI, NIA and ZT.\n\nSerious  non-conformities  (Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero Tolerance  and  Access  Denied)  or  the  failure  to  implement corrective actions can result in the non-listing of a new Supplier or  the  suspension  or  termination  of  commercial  relations  with a listed Supplier.\n\nAll the  main  non-conformities  found  are  monitored  and consolidated annually by risk type.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can  be initiated.  Visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the  process  of routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result,  if  necessary, in additional audits.\n\nAdditional procedures: L'Or\u00e9al also uses analyses and ratings provided  by  EcoVadis,  an  analytical  company,  to  evaluate the  policies  implemented  by  the  Suppliers,  among  others, in terms of the issues covered by the Plan. This evaluation is an indicative  guide  that  can  be  added to the audits described above.  By  participating  in  the  EcoVadis  assessment,  L'Or\u00e9al compares  its  environmental  and  social  policy  with  the expertise  and  the  recommendations  of  external  auditors qualified in the analysis of multi-sector risks. This is a useful rating for  the  continuous  improvement  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  programme, it also contributes to the transparency of industry practices. This assessment  is  used  to  select  suppliers  by  taking  their environmental  and  social  performance  into  consideration. L'Or\u00e9al is co-founder of the Responsible Beauty Initiative (RBI), a  sector  initiative  created  in  2017  with  EcoVadis.  It  brings together eight major players in the cosmetics industry for the sustainable transformation of the entire beauty supply chain.\n\n## (ii) Self-assessment system\n\nHuman  Rights  and  fundamental  freedoms: An  annual  ethics reporting  system  enables  monitoring  of  the  implementation of the Applicable Rules in the Subsidiaries, namely with regard to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nEnvironment,  health  and  safety  in  the  workplace: The Management  Committees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Sites  have  tools  for the  self-assessment  of  their  practices  based  on  the  audit standards  provided  to  them.  This  enables  them  to  produce an  improvement  plan,  if  required.  These  self-assessments  are input data in the EHS risk audits.\n\nTo direct its performance:\n\n- \u00b7 every year, each Subsidiary site defines and revises its safety and  environmental  roadmaps  to  achieve  the  targets  set by the Group. It tracks EHS indicators monthly.\n- \u00b7 at  Group  level,  the  indicators  are  consolidated  monthly by region and globally for the Group's results.\n- \u00b7 a  Greenhouse  Gas  Assessment  is  prepared  annually (in accordance with the GHG Protocol).\n\n## 3.4.6. Whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system\n\n'L'Or\u00e9al Speak Up', L'Or\u00e9al's internal whistleblowing mechanism,  has  been  in  place  since  2008.  This  system  gives employees and stakeholders access to a secure website they can  use  to  raise  any  concerns  they  may  have,  including serious  infringements  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms,  health  and  safety  at  work  and  respect  for  the environment,  with  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance Officer,  in  a  secure,  effective  manner  that  provides  all  the\n\nguarantees  of  confidentiality  necessary  for  the  reporting  of potential  breaches.  Any  allegations  expressed  in  good  faith are examined in detail and adequate corrective measures are taken,  if  applicable.  Employees  have  several  other  methods of  raising  their  concerns  (line  management,  dedicated  local hotlines etc.). The  whistle-blowing  line  was  opened  to employees in 2008, and then to stakeholders in 2018.\n\n## 3.4.7. Update on the effective implementation of the Plan\n\nThis section provides the 2022 results of the application of the Plan for Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## 3.4.7.1. General results of whistleblowing mechanisms and reporting\n\nIn  2022,  there  were  510  reports  on  potential  non-compliance with the Applicable Rules, including:\n\n- \u25cf 22 on sexual harassment, 6 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  and  which  resulted  in  5  departures  from  the Group;\n- \u25cf 73 on bullying, 12 of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in 1 departure from the Group;\n- \u00b7 28 on discrimination, 3 of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in 3 departures from the Group;\n- \u25cf 20 on health and safety, 1 of which was proven, in whole or in part, which resulted in no departures from the Group; and\n- \u00b7 none on environmental issues.\n\n## 3.4.7.2. Results of the application of the Plan to Subsidiaries\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  incorporated  into  the  Group's Subsidiaries' internal rules.\n\n95%  of  employees  individually  acknowledged  the  receipt  of the Code of Ethics and 87% of employees have been trained using an e-learning training tool on ethics.\n\nEach  EHS  manager  and  each  person  working  in  a  factory or  distribution  centre  is  trained  in  the  Applicable  Rules  on Health, Safety and the Environment (EHS). All new employees are trained in the Rules on Health and Safety in the workplace and the Environment, regardless of their work location.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring and control system in respect of Human Rights\n\nThe monitoring of compliance with the Applicable Rules by all Subsidiaries  is  bolstered  by  the  Speak  Up  whistleblowing mechanism. An extensive communication campaign explains how Group employees can access the mechanism; the results for  2022  are  shown  in  the  preceding  paragraph.  The  annual Ethics  Day  dialogue  sessions  held  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer  and  the  Directors  of  Subsidiaries  give  employees  the opportunity  to  have  their  say  on  these  topics.  Action  plans may  be  initiated,  including  corrective  measures  when necessary.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  entities  self-assess  compliance  with the Applicable Rules and submit these self-assessments as part of the annual ethics reporting on Human  Rights,  in accordance with the Group's Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\nThe  entities  ensure  that  their  employees  are  familiar  with  this policy.  They  have  organised  training  and  communication sessions  on  the  topics  covered  by  this  policy  (health/safety at  work,  diversity  and  equity  and  inclusion,  anti-harassment policy etc.).\n\nThe  completed  self-assessments  are  consolidated  at  Group level; some of the key information from these self-assessments is given below.\n\n- (i) Child labour : it was reported that in 2022:\n- \u00b7 17 employees were 16-18 years of age (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 0 employees under 16 years of age worked in the Subsidiaries.\n- (ii) Forced labour : no use of prison labour was identified.\n\n## (iii) Freedom of association and right to collective bargaining :\n\nthe Subsidiaries uphold freedom of association and employees'  right  to  collective  bargaining,  in  particular  the right  to  form/join  a  union,  except  in  countries  that  limit  or restrict  this  right.  In  this  case,  they  ensure  there  are  other methods of dialogue with employees in place that allow them to raise any concerns they may have.\n\n- (v) Working hours : all Subsidiaries complied  with the Applicable Rules on rest time.\n\n## Monitoring and control system in respect of Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nIn 2022,  85  'Top  managers'  (managers  of  factories  or distribution centres, Management Committee members, etc.) attended the Leadership & Safety Culture seminar, held at the CEDEP,  The  European  Centre  for  Executive  Development, at  the  INSEAD  campus  in  France.  Since  the  start  of  this programme,  754  senior  managers  have  been  trained. The seminar aims to raise awareness with top managers about safety  issues,  increase  their  leadership  ability  and  see  these behaviours adopted and maintained over the long term.\n\n34  factories  are  certified  ISO  45001,  representing  89%  of  the Group's  factories.  35  factories  are  certified  ISO  14001, representing 92% of the Group's factories.\n\nIn 2022, the following EHS audits were conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 20 risk audits;\n- \u00b7 8 combined risk and EHS culture audits; and\n- \u00b7 7  combined  Quality,  Environment,  Health,  Safety  and Performance audits and 3 combined Quality, Environment, Health and Safety audits.\n\nThe  most  frequently  identified  risks  during  EHS  risk  audits  are related  to  fire protection,  procedure  safety,  hazardous energies,  containment  of  fire  water  runoff  and  wastewater management. The cases of non-conformity and formal notice were systematically subject to corrective actions.\n\nOne factory was the subject of a neighbourhood complaint in 2022,  for  two  reasons:  the  first  involving  the  noise  caused by  the  use  of  a  chiller  and  the  second  involving  an  odour problem originating from the site's filtration garden (an installation that uses plants to treat wastewater).\n\nTwo cases of non-compliance with environmental regulations were  notified  by  an  administrative  authority  in  2022.  They involve  2  factories,  the  first  of  which  relates  to  wastewater quality, and the second to the management of lightning risk.\n\nNo fines were imposed in 2022.\n\n## 3.4.7.3. Results of the application of the Plan to Suppliers\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\n100%  of  strategic  Suppliers  in  the  direct  purchases  category and  95%  of  strategic  Suppliers  in  the  indirect  purchases category  have  made  a  contractual  commitment  to  comply with the Applicable Rules.\n\nAll  purchasers  know  the  Applicable  Rules  and  know  which people to contact in the event of doubts.\n\nIn 2022, 103 newly recruited purchasers in the Group received in-depth training in responsible purchases.\n\n## Monitoring and control system\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  controlled  through  external  audits. These  audits  cover  questions  on  Human  Rights  as  well  as Environment,  Health  and  Safety  and  cover  all  activities  of the audited Site without being limited to the parts of the Site that operate for L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n1,145 on-site audits were conducted in 2022, as part of regular audits,  but  also  ad  hoc  audits  following  a  risk  analysis (29 ad hoc audits in 2022) (2) .  Thus,  99% of Supplier production sites requiring audits were audited at least once.\n\nThe cases of non-compliance noted during these social audits that come under the Plan are described below.\n\nIn  2022,  859  suppliers  conducted  an  Ecovadis  assessment  of their social, environmental and ethical policies, as well as the implementation of those policies by their own suppliers in 2022.\n\n## In terms of Human Rights\n\n## Results of audits by topic\n\n- (i) Child labour : 1.3% of non-conformities.\n\nThe employment of a child under the age of 16 was identified in 3 audits. One of the three suppliers was granted exemption by  L'Or\u00e9al  upon  presentation  of  a  comprehensive  file certifying  that  the  young  workers  only  carry  out  light  duties that have no effect on their health and safety or their regular attendance  at  school,  that  their  employment  complies  with local  legislation  and  that  the  supplier  has  appointed  an in-house  'guardian'  for  these  young  people.  The  necessary measures  have  been  taken  to  discontinue  any  commercial relationship  with  the  other  two  suppliers.  Other  cases  of non-conformity involved in particular, the absence  of procedures to verify age at the time of hiring by the Supplier, the  absence  of  copies  of  identity  documents,  and  the",

The  Suppliers  concerned  have  been  asked  to  correct  these situations, and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (ii) Forced labour : 6% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nDuring one audit, it was noted that employees were unable to mix freely or use the toilet facilities at their own convenience. The  necessary  measures  have  been  taken  to  rectify  this situation  with  the  company  concerned.  Other  cases  of non-conformity concern the demand for a monetary deposit at the time of hiring, withholding of identity documents without a legal requirement, the freedom for employees to end their contracts without being penalised (financially or other) except for those  stipulated  by  social  legislation,  the  absence or  inadequacy  of  employment  contracts,  and  the  absence or  inadequacy  of  work  permits  for  foreign  workers.  The  main corrective measures requested were the return of the identity documents  and  the  updating  of  employee  contracts. Follow-up  audits  will  check  the  effective  implementation of these corrective measures.\n\n## (iii) Freedom of association and right to collective bargaining (1)\n\n3% non-compliance\n\n## : \u2611 .\n\nMost  of  the  cases  of  non-conformity  concern  the  failure  to freely  elect  employee  representatives  without  management interference.  Elections  must  be  carried  out,  or  in  countries where such elections are not legal, employee meetings must be organised or alternative arrangements made for employees to raise any concerns or complaints they may have.\n\n## (iv) Non-discrimination : 1.1% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nThese  cases  of  non-conformity  mainly  concern  the  absence of  a  clear  and  uniform  policy  to  ensure  the  absence  of discrimination at recruitment or discrimination in the payment of  wages  and  other  costs.  It  was  also  noted  that  some suppliers  required  pregnancy  tests  as  part  of  the  recruitment process.\n\nSuppliers were requested to take corrective action, which will be checked in future audits.\n\n## (v) Working hours : 25% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nCases  of  non-conformity  involved  failure  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules for work time and regular days off, but also the lack of sufficient documents to ensure correct monitoring of the Applicable Rules. In all of these cases, corrective action plans are implemented and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (vi) Wages and charges : 18.3% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nThe audits did not find undue salary withholding or charges.\n\nMost of the cases of non-conformity concerned insurance and social security contributions, as well as a failure to monitor the payment  of  wages,  or  non-payment  of  the  minimum  wage. When an audit notes a case of non-compliance with regard to  the  correct  settlement  of  wages,  social  benefits  or  the correct  payment  of  overtime,  even  though  these  are  not undue  salary  deductions,  the  Suppliers  are  requested  to correct the situation and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (vi) Sexual harassment and bullying : 3.1% non-compliance.\n\nMost  of  these  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  the absence  of  a  written  policy  prohibiting  sexual  harassment and  bullying  or  the  absence  of  an  internal  system  allowing the  situation  to  be  reported  without  negative  consequences for the employee concerned.\n\nSuppliers were requested to draft these policies, which will be checked in future audits.\n\nThe  other  cases  of  non-conformity  did  not  concern  serious breaches of the Applicable Rules.\n\n## (viii) Disciplinary practices : 2.3% non-compliance.\n\nMost  of  these  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  the absence of clear written rules regarding disciplinary practices, or  a  lack  of  communication of these rules to the company's employees.\n\nSuppliers  were  requested  to  draft  these  rules,  which  will  be checked in future audits.\n\n## (ix) Subcontracting : 1% non-compliance.\n\nAll  cases  of  non-conformity  related  to  a  lack  of  practice on the part of the supplier to ensure that L'Or\u00e9al's standards of ethics are upheld in their own supply chain.\n\nCorrective  action  has  been  requested  and  will  be  checked in future audits.\n\n## Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n39.1%  of  the  cases  of  non-compliance  concerned  the applicable rules on Health, Safety and the Environment.\n\nMost  of  these  cases  involved  the  absence  of  fire  safety certificates,  a  lack  of  training  in  emergency  evacuations, handling of fire extinguishers or the use of protective equipment, the  absence  of  an  evacuation  plan,  or  shortcomings  with regard to emergency routes or exits.\n\nIn all of these cases, corrective action plans are implemented and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## Sustainable sourcing of raw materials\n\nIn  2022,  100%  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used  by  the Group were reassessed on the basis of criteria such as respect for biodiversity and forced labour. Out of the 329 plant species that  are  the  source  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used by  the  Group,  around  6% (2) present  significant  biodiversity challenges  (endangered  species,  impact  of  production on  natural  environments)  depending  on  their  geographic origin  and  the  method  of  extraction  or  production  used. They  are  the  subject  of  specific  action  plans  initiated  with suppliers and, if necessary, benefit from the systematic support of  independent  external  third  parties,  in  order  to  manage the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.",

Definitions and general framework\n\nRisk  management  (events  or  situations,  the  occurrence  of which  is  uncertain,  could  have  a  financial,  non-financial, or  reputational  impact)  is  a  process  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (the  'Group'). Risk management  consists  of  identifying,  assessing  and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different\n\n## 3.5.2. Risk mapping\n\nThe  Group's  risk  mapping  process  is  led  by  the  Ethics,  Risks and Compliance Department with the support of all Support Divisions  and  Business  lines.  This  mapping  is  reviewed  by  the\n\nGroup's Executive Committee, which validates it.\n\n## 3.5.3. Risk factors\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  changing  environment.  Like  any company, it is necessarily exposed to risks which, if they were to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  its  business activities,  its  financial  position  and  its  assets,  particularly  in terms of reputation and image.\n\nFor taking an informed investment decision, as required by the regulations  in  force,  this  section  presents  the  major  risks  in  a limited  number  of  categories  (given  the  probability  of  their occurrence  and  the  expected  magnitude  of  their  negative impact)  taking  risk  management  policies  into  account.\n\nareas  of  activity.  In  addition,  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board of  Directors  specify  the  role  of  the  Audit  Committee  which 'must  ensure  that  General  Management  has  the  means  to enable  it  to  identify  and  manage  the  economic,  financial, non-financial,  and  legal  risks  facing  the  Group  inside  and outside  France  in  carrying  out  its  normal  or  exceptional operations'.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  work  by  the  Internal  Audit  Department, the  analysis  of  major  risks,  in  conjunction  with  the  processes used  by  subsidiaries,  makes  it  possible  to  identify  Internal Control improvements and update the Group's standards.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  for  all  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities  is  updated annually. This process to identify, analyse and assess significant risks strengthens  Group  actions  and  allows  them  to  be prioritised.  The  results  of  this  work  are  presented  to  the  Audit Committee. The main risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.\n\nIn  each category, the most material risks are mentioned first. This  section  specifies  the  way  in  which  each  risk  factor  could affect L'Or\u00e9al as well as the management policy implemented. Risk management work classifies the residual risks by category of importance (low, moderate or significant).\n\nHowever, a wholly risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed. Moreover,  the  Group  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  other risks  of  which  it  is  not  currently  aware  or  which  it  does  not consider material at the date of this document.",

Business risks\n\n## Business risks/Sanitary crisis\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nBecause of its global presence, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to epidemics or other public sanitary crises in the 80 countries in which it operates.\n\nThe  main  risks  identified  cover  different  segments  of  the  Group's operations:\n\n- \u25cf impairment  of  the  health,  safety  and  security  of  employees  in  the context of their duties and their business travel, and confinement of the population that prevents employees from entering their work site, particularly at the manufacturing and distribution sites;\n- \u25cf difficulties  for  the  company  to  operate  normally  because  of  the restrictive  measures  established  by  the  authorities,  which  restrict employee  access  to  the  Group's  sites,  or  as  a  result  of  the unavailability  of  individual  protective  equipment  necessary  to protect them;\n- \u25cf supply difficulties,  unavailability  or  increased  prices  of  raw  materials and components, and limited capacities to produce and distribute products related to the restrictive health measures established by the authorities of the countries in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf reductions in product demand related to the impact of the measures to restrict movement on access to physical points of sale, particularly in  the  Travel  Retail  network  that  is  particularly  sensitive  to  sanitary crises;\n- \u25cf financial  difficulties  for  suppliers  and  clients  as  a  result  of  a  drastic reduction in their levels of business.\n\nThus 2022 was marked by the impacts of the Covid-19 health crisis in a number of geographic zones in which the Group operates, particularly China.\n\nDepending  on  its  duration,  geographic  expansion  and  the  resulting economic  and  social  consequences,  a  sanitary  crisis  may  have  a material  impact  on  the  Group's  activities,  its  performance  and  its reputation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a crisis management process led by a unit at Group level that can prevent and limit the impacts of undesirable events on all its entities.\n\nFacing a sanitary crisis, the Group's priority is to protect the health, safety and security of its employees. The Group responds through compliance with the directives of the authorities in the countries in which it operates, the  application  and  adaptation  of  its  worldwide,  high  management standards  for  health  and  safety  at  its  operational  sites  and  in  business travel situations.\n\nThe  Group's  information  systems  allow  large-scale  development  of flexible  and  remote  work  methods  and  are  the  subject  of  adequate safety protection processes (see section 4.3.2.4.).\n\nThe policies to manage supply chain and inventories, and the business continuity  plans  of  the  industrial  and  logistics  sites,  allow  the  Group to anticipate the actions necessary to manage  disturbances. The long-term relations with the Group's strategic suppliers, the policies to  diversify  sources,  and  operational  continuity  plans,  limit  the  impacts of these crises.\n\nThe Group's presence in all distribution channels, particularly online sales capacities developed with diversified partners (owned sites, e-retailers, pure  players),  as  well  as  its  expertise  in  digitised  consumer  relations, help to maximise development opportunities in disturbed contexts.\n\nFinally,  the  Group's  worldwide  and  balanced  presence  in  terms  of geographic  areas,  product  categories  and  distribution  channels,  the very  high  responsiveness  and  capacity  for  adaptation  of  its  teams through  its  strategically  centralised  and  operationally  decentralised organisational  model  with  a  strong  entrepreneurial  spirit,  as  well  as  its robust  financial  position,  contribute  to  its  ability  to  face  the  economic consequences of these crises.",

Furthermore, to adapt to the development of new ways of communication and collaboration, L'Or\u00e9al has introduced an  Information  and  Communication  Technologies  Code  of  Practice. To deal with the growing cyber-threats, L'Or\u00e9al continuously strenghten the  resources  dedicated  to  information  system  security.  A  multi-year plan  aimed  at  reducing  the  level  of  risk  from  cyberthreats  and strengthening the maturity of risk management was therefore set out.\n\nThis  plan  relies  in  particular  on  anti-intrusion  solutions,  regular  read teaming  and  penetration  tests,  an  information  system  security  audit programme, the protection of sensitive assets and global supervision to detect malicious activities. L'Or\u00e9al's security focus is constantly adjusted to  deal  with  new  threats  of  cyberattacks.  For  example,  the  Group  is increasingly investing in incidents detection and reactions systems and proceeds to regular reviews of the effectiveness of these solutions.\n\nOnline training in cybersecurity best practices is available for all eligible employees (more than 42,000 employees, i.e. 73% of eligible employees, have  received  training  via  a  new  e-learning  module  published  at  the end of 2021). Specific trainings are also available for other employees. In addition  to  regular  communication  throughout  the  year,  the  Group conducts an annual global awareness campaign called Cyberweek.\n\nManagement  of  risks  related  to  data  is  described  in  the  'Data'  risk section.\n\n## Business risks/Geographic presence and economic and political environment\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is a global corporation that has subsidiaries in 76 countries. More specifically,  the  global  development  of  the  cosmetics  market  has  led L'Or\u00e9al to develop its Travel Retail business and its business in countries of North  Asia,  which  represented  29,6%  of  sales  in  2022,  SAPMENA-SSA (South Asia Pacific, Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa) 7,7% of sales, and Latin America (6,2% of sales). Because of this globalisation, political  or  economic  disruption  (strong  economic  slowdown  due,  for example, to geopolitical tensions, sustained high inflation, international trade tensions or sovereign debt crises) in countries in which the Group generates a significant portion of its sales could have an impact on its business activities.\n\nAs  regards  Russia's  invasion  of  Ukraine  at  the  beginning  of  2022, depending  on  its  duration  and  extent,  the  conflict  could  impact economic growth worldwide and, consequently, affect the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nThe impact and management of inflation and currency risks, and those associated  with  economic  sanctions  policies,  are  described  in  the  risk factors entitled 'Inflation and currency risk' and 'Risk of non-conformity' respectively.\n\nThe  impact  and  management  of  the  risk  related  to  Covid-19  are described in the 'Sanitary crisis' risk factor.\n\n## Business risks/Crisis management\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nPrejudicial events or information mainly related to the use or misuse of a product,  or  an  inappropriate  individual  behaviour,  whether  proven  or not,  could  affect  the  reputation  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  36  major  international brands  and  its  products  and,  as  a  result,  affect  sales  and,  more generally, its financial position.\n\nThe impact of the risk could be amplified, notably, by:\n\n- \u25cf the explosion of digital and social media all around the world; and\n- \u25cf societal movements and enquiries by the civil society, consumers, etc. to the Group or the brands.\n\nThe  impact  and  management  of  risk  associated  with  social  selling, particularly  via  influencers,  are  described  in  the  risk  factor  entitled 'Evolution of sales channels'.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a system of:\n\n- \u25cf training  sessions  in  crisis  communication  and  support  for  the communication teams on key issues for the Group;\n- \u25cf crisis risk management at corporate and local levels;\n- \u25cf ongoing  online  monitoring.  The  subsidiaries  deploy  their  own  social media and web monitoring systems under the responsibility of  their Director  of  Communication  and  immediately  report  a  media  risk  in their country to the Corporate Communications Department; and\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al has set up a crisis  management procedure which is tasked with  preventing,  managing  and  mitigating  the  consequences  of undesirable  events  on  the  company  across  the  globe.  The  Group crisis management officer reports directly to General Management.\n\nThe  deployment  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  throughout  the  Group  aims  at reinforcing  the  dissemination  of  the  rules  of  conduct  which  form  the basis  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  integrity  and  ethics.  These  rules  of  conduct  seek  to guide  actions  and  behaviour,  inspire  choices  and  make  sure  that  the Group's values are reflected in the everyday acts of each employee. L'Or\u00e9al  has    implemented  a  'Code  of  Good  Practice  for  the  Use of Social Media' for its employees.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  global  presence  and  its  portfolio  of  36  major  international brands helps to maintain a balance in sales and offsetting between the geographic  zones,  product  categories  and  distribution  channels (details on sales from the zones are presented in section 1.3.).\n\nWith  regard  to  the  crisis  in  Ukraine  and  Russia,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  closely monitoring  the  situation  and  its  potential  for  adversely  impacting the global economy and, in particular, its business activity (see section 1.3.1.).\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management",

The increasing adoption of various laws aimed at limiting and controlling the transfer of data is also a growing risk factor to which L'Or\u00e9al is exposed.\n\nAny  breach  of  data  integrity  or  confidentiality,  notably  personal  data processed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  or  its  partners,  for  exogenous  or  endogenous reasons  (including  intrusions,  malicious  acts,  etc.)  could  have  a significant impact on its reputation and consumer confidence and thus on the Group's business activities.\n\n## Business risks/Market and innovation\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  subject  to  constant  pressure  from  many  competitors  in  all countries due to:\n\n- \u25cf its  size  and  the  positioning  of  its  brands  in  various  markets  in  which major international groups operate;\n- \u25cf local brands and new players coming from the digital economy;\n- \u25cf rapid  technological  changes in  emerging fields  of  research  by  new operators.\n\nIf  the  Group  fails  to  anticipate  or  respond  to  changes  in  consumer expectations,  especially  in  the  areas  of  natural  beauty,  health, personalised services, connected things and environmental commitments, with innovative and adapted product offerings, its sales and growth could be affected.\n\n## Business risks/Business ethics\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs  L'Or\u00e9al  is  an  international  group  of  over  87,000  employees,  which operates  in  80  countries  at  more  than  400  sites  (excluding  stores  and point-of-sales  outlets  of  distributor  customers),  it  cannot  exclude potential violations of its ethical commitments (Code of Ethics based on the four Ethical Principles -Integrity, Respect, Courage  and Transparency  -,  its  Human  Rights  policy,  support  of  the  United  Nations Global  Compact  and  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development Goals, etc.), whether directly by its employees, or indirectly because of the activities of its partners, particularly its suppliers and subcontractors. In  addition,  civil  society  is  expressing  higher  expectations  with  regard companies'  integrity  and  transparency  and  the  way  in  which  they manage scientific and technological innovations. Such non-compliance with its commitments or the lack of a response to new ethical questions could have an adverse impact on the Group's reputation and expose it to criminal or administrative sanctions.\n\nThe  Group's  policies  on  sustainable  development,  social  and  societal responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based  on  the  Ethical Principles. The role and the resources granted to the Chief Ethics Officer allow  him  to  succeed  in  his  mission  by  relying  on  all  the  teams  and resources  of  the  Group  (see  section  3.2.1.).  Specific  training  of management  teams,  regular  dialogue  with  stakeholders  and  the establishment of internal working groups, facilitate the inclusion of Ethics in the Group's new policies and strategic decisions. The ethical risks are mapped  and  regularly updated, including for suppliers and subcontractors  (see  section  3.4.5.2.).  The  deployment  of  the  Code  of Ethics  throughout  the  Group,  mandatory  e-learning  training  and ongoing  communication  campaigns  via  an  Ethics  Day,  ensure  that employees are aware of the ethical standards. A network of 78 Ethics Correspondents  around  the  world  and  regular  meetings  of  the  Chief Ethics  Officer  with  the  Countries,  ensure  close  contact  with  these employees. Regular audits of the Group's sites and those of its suppliers and  subcontractors  (see  section  3.4.  'Vigilance  Plan'),  the  Group's whistleblowing line (www.lorealspeakup.com) opened in 2018 accessible to all Group stakeholders, as well as a procedure to collect and process reports, allow to manage potential violations.\n\nThe  Group  continually  adapts  its  innovation  model  and  is  constantly increasing  its  investments  in  research  and  digital  services.  L'Or\u00e9al's Research teams innovate to respond to the infinite diversity  of  beauty aspirations  all  over  the  world.  The  Consumer  &  Market  Insights Department, within the Innovation Department, is constantly monitoring changes  in  consumer  expectations  by  product  category  and  major regions of the world.\n\nAll of these research programmes, which are part of a long-term vision, allow L'Or\u00e9al to meet the challenges of innovation (see section 1.2.8.).\n\nThe Digital and Marketing Department is responsible for accelerating the Group's  digital  transformation  by  helping  the  brands  create  enriched spaces for expression and helping teams to establish more interactive, close-knit and bespoke relationships with consumers.\n\nConsumer expectations with regard to sustainability are also at the heart of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (see  chapter  4).  These  are taken  into  account  in  developing  the  Group's  brand  and  product portfolio.\n\nThe Group's acquisition strategy always takes into account changes in the competitive environment.\n\nThe  Group  constantly  and  progressively  deploys  policies,  training  and data management tools as well as the associated organisational  and technical measures. The Global IT Department has introduced strict rules about data security (back-up, protection of, and restrictions on access to confidential data).\n\nThe Group's principles governing the processing of personal data have been  rolled-out  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees about respect for ethical principles, and legal and regulatory requirements in the matter.\n\nAn organisation has been set up based on a Global Data Privacy Office at Group level, comprising a legal unit and a programme unit. A Group Data  Protection  Officer  was  appointed  in  2018  and  a  network  of  44 Country DPOs has been created, for all countries in the European Zone and gradually in other regions of the world.\n\nThe  governance  set  up  is  based  on  a  Global  Strategic  Committee, a Steering Committee by region, as well as a network of Heads of Data Privacy  within  the  M\u00e9tiers  and  Zones,  responsible  for  the  protection  of personal  data.  They  provide  support  to  all  operational  stakeholders involved.\n\nThis  governance notably aims to monitor the Group's compliance with different  laws,  by  ensuring  the  mobilisation  of  all  stakeholders  and  by adapting customer, supplier and business line processes to the Group's rules and to applicable laws.",

        "page_content": "## Business risks/Evolution of sales channels\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo market its products, L'Or\u00e9al relies not only on traditional independent distribution  channels  and  the  development  of  direct-to-consumer distribution for certain brands (directly owned stores and e-commerce), but also on the use of social media.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \u25cf by developing  networks  of  Group  brand  ambassadors  and communities  to  be  part  of  the  conversation  around  brands  and products (partnerships with relevant influencers, advocacy marketing etc.); and\n- \u25cf by promoting social seling to better target the needs and expectations of consumers who are increasingly turning to these channels.\n\nThe  impact  of  the  risk  could  be  amplified,  in  particular  by  the emergence of social beauty, which is connected and shared, and by the role of influencers as opinion leaders with a significant following and/ or subscribers.\n\nAlso, undisclosed  advertisement  or  posts  that  materially  mislead consumers or cause serious or widespread offence by an influencer on one of the brands in the Group's portfolio, or neglecting the importance of new sales and marketing strategies on social networks, could impact results.\n\nSee also the \"Crisis management\" risk.\n\n## Business risks/Risk related to Human Resources\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is changing within a complex,  highly  competitive  and  rapidly  changing  environment (globalisation, diversity and inclusion challenges, sustainable development  issues,  acceleration  of  the  digital  transformation  etc.) that  requires  specific  expertise.  The  Covid-19  health  crisis  has  left  a significant  mark  on  the  job  market,  with  new  employee  expectations regarding  working  methods,  particularly  with  the  introduction  of  a sustainable  hybrid  mode,  alternating  between  on-site  and  remote working.  If  L'Or\u00e9al  fails  to  identify,  attract,  recruit,  retain,  promote  and develop competent and engaged employees who behave responsibly within  diverse  teams,  the  development  of  its  activities  and  its  results could be affected.\n\nMoreover, given L'Or\u00e9al's activities, particularly its industrial operations, the risk of occupational injuries or illnesses could become a reality.\n\nIn  addition,  psychosocial  risks,  exacerbated  by  the  effects  of  the Covid-19 health crisis,  may  affect  the  well-being  of  Group  employees. This  could  also  have  an  adverse  impact  on  their  commitment  and, consequently, on the Group's performance.\n\nThe  Group  is  developing  a  motivating,  professional  environment  with respect  for  its  ethical  values,  particularly  diversity.  The  recruitment  and development of employees occurs within a long-term perspective, also to  ensure  the  continuity  of  key  functions  within  the  Group,  in  which training plays a core role throughout an employee's career.\n\nThe remuneration policy combines external competitiveness and internal fairness. It recognises both individual and collective performance.\n\nThe global Share & Care programme meets the essential needs of each of the Group's employees in terms of benefits, healthcare, parenthood, flexibility  and  quality  of  life  at  work.  Actions  for  stress  prevention  and workstation  ergonomics  are  organised.  In  order  to  meet  employees' expectations  in  this  new  hybrid  working  environment,  L'Or\u00e9al  has developed  a  balanced  Group  policy  to  ensure  that  opportunities  for cooperation, discussion and creativity are always prioritised.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  ambitious  goals  for  the  health  and  safety  of  its employees, defining high standards that often exceed legal obligations and  involve  personnel  at  all  levels.  Prevention  is  based  on  the  GHAP (Global  Hazard  Assessment  Procedure)  and  SHAP  (Safety  Hazard Assessment  Procedure)  programmes,  which  identify  the  hazards, generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the  risks  and  allow  the implementation of the necessary means of control (see section 4.3.2.1).\n\nThe presence of the Group's brands in all types of distribution channels allows  the  Group  to  offer  its  products  and  services,  whatever  the consumer  practices.  The  departments  concerned  anticipate  trends to adapt to these changes and, in particular, have steadily developed online sales with diversified partners (e-distributors, platforms, and market places).\n\nThe  Group  has  set  a  solid  internal  control  system,  including  the deployment of certain guidelines:\n\n- \u25cf a  Code  of  Good  Practice  for  the  Use  of  Social  Media  for  its employees;\n- \u25cf an Influencer Values Charter and a Social Selling Values Charter that each  influencer  or  social  seller  with  whom  L'Or\u00e9al  collaborates undertakes to respect;\n- \u25cf the Group's principles and the operational processes to be applied in relation to partnerships with influencers and social sellers have been circulated  worldwide  to  all  employees  involved  in  advocacy marketing.  The  Group  seeks  to  work  with  influencers  &  social  sellers who share its values and Ethical Principles. Depending on the nature of  the  relationship,  the  Group  reserves  the  right  to  pursue  due diligence  by  way  of  reviewing  information  already  in  the  public domain.  These  documents  effectively  complement  the  rules  of conduct set out in the Group's Code of Ethics;\n- \u25cf a  permanent  online  monitoring  system.  The  subsidiaries  deploy  their own social media and web monitoring systems under the responsibility of their Director of Communication and immediately report a media risk in their country to the Corporate Communications Department.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management",

The  direct  and  indirect  consequences  of  these risks may adversely affect people and the assets of the Group (tangible and intangible).\n\nIn order to permanently protect these persons and resources (or Group assets)  against  malicious  acts,  the  Safety  Department  helps  in  the preventive implementation of technical, HR and operational procedures to  limit  the  residual  risk  of  malicious  damage  and  support  the  Group's international development in all countries concerned. For this purpose, the Safety Department:\n\n- \u25cf coordinates, with related key players, the security crisis management procedure  which  is  tasked  with  preventing,  managing  and  limiting the consequences of undesirable events on the Group;\n- \u25cf coordinates assistance for Group  employees  who  travel  for international assignments;\n- \u25cf has  implemented  a  watch  and  evaluation  of  the  state  of  security in the countries in which the Group is active;\n- \u25cf conducts evaluation updates in the countries in which it is present;\n- \u25cf establishes processes for alerting and  reporting, mobilisation, decision-making  using  the  CALM  method,  demobilisation  and feedback;\n- \u25cf defines  the  security  standards  and  minimum  protection  to  be implemented to protect the Group's activities;\n- \u25cf organises training sessions and runs crisis management exercises for all entities affected; and\n- \u25cf develops tools to be put into action at the very start of the crisis: the POB (People On Board) and the Security Check are primarily used to assess impacts on people.\n\nThe  security  measures  are  regularly  adjusted  and  reassessed  based on the local situation and the level of exposure of employees and sites.\n\nConsumer  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for  L'Or\u00e9al:  assessing  safety  is central  to  any  new  product  development  process  and  a  prerequisite before any new product can be brought to the market. The principles governing the Group's quality and safety policy are:\n\n- \u25cf satisfaction of customer needs;\n- \u25cf compliance with safety requirements and laws;\n- \u25cf maintenance of standards and regular updates of safety assessment approaches; and\n- \u25cf product quality and conformity across the supply chain.\n\nThe Worldwide Safety Evaluation Department specifically evaluates the safety  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the toxicological  profile  of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  tolerance  of  the formulas before they are launched on the market, so that the Group's products can be guaranteed to be completely safe for consumer use. The  same  safety  standards  are  applied  worldwide  to  ensure  identical quality across the globe.\n\nThrough  its  international  cosmeto-vigilance  network,  L'Or\u00e9al  goes  one step  further  in  safety  assessments  by  monitoring  the  potential  adverse effects  that  may  arise  once  the  product  is  on  the  market,  in  order  to take  the  appropriate  corrective  measures,  if  necessary  (see  'Product quality and safety: a priority' in section 4.3.1.3.2.).\n\nIn  terms  of  questions  that  civil  society  may  ask  regarding  certain substances and their effects on health and the environment, L'Or\u00e9al's position can be summarised in three points:\n\n- \u25cf vigilant monitoring of any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u25cf cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u25cf precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  relies  on  its  scientific  teams  to  answer  consumers'  questions about the safety of its products, primarily through its Inside our Products platform that has been online since 2019.\n\nLastly, quality standards are defined by our Conception Quality Systems for Formulas,  Packagings,  Manufacturing  Processes  and  by  our Conformity Quality Systems for Production and Supply Chain. Almost all factories are ISO 9001 certified for their production and follow the Best Manufacturing Practices in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard. In the case of production subcontracting, the rules governing the choice of the subcontractor and its production follow the same principles. The subcontracting quality charter picks up these requirements, compliance with which is assessed during audits and the plan regularly strengthened to ensure appropriate control of our partners.",

Industrial and environmental risks\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Product availability\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn  the  context  of  a  globalised  supply  chain  and  the  increased geographic  concentration  of  certain  supply  sources,  the  failure  of  an external supplier to deliver raw materials, filling and  packing components  or  finished  products,  whether  resulting  from  operational difficulties  or  significant  non-compliance  with  ethical  commitments, along with a major interruption of operations in a L'Or\u00e9al industrial unit or shipping  hub,  could  impact  the  Group's  sales  because  of  the unavailability of products that could result from this.\n\nIn 2022, Group purchases related to production totalled \u20ac6.4 billion.\n\nThe impact and management of risk associated with the availability of products  caused  by  climate  change  are  described  in  the  risk  factor entitled 'Climate Change'.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Climate change\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs for any company, the Group's activities are exposed to the physical and transition risks related to climate change.\n\nThe increase in risks of natural origin, both extreme and chronic, the loss of  biodiversity,  and  the  increased  pressure  on  water  resources  could impact  the  availability  of  finished  products  by  disturbing  the  Group's operations  and  supply  chain.  The  scarcity  of  resources  and  the implementation of the transition towards a low-carbon economy could also increase production costs.\n\nIn  addition,  insufficient  consideration  during  product  design  related  to the impact of their usage by consumers could represent a risk for sales in certain  areas  of  the  world  affected  by  water  stress  or  the  lack  of adapted infrastructures to collect and treat waste and wastewater.\n\nLastly,  consumer  choices  could  be  increasingly  influenced  by  the impact  associated  with  the  use  of  a  product  (its  carbon  footprint,  its water  footprint,  its  impact  on  biodiversity)  and  by  the  Group's  overall environmental  performance,  particularly  in  terms  of  reducing  its  CO2 emissions in all Scopes.\n\nAs a result, if the Group did not sufficiently anticipate all these impacts and did not initiate a voluntary process to adapt to climate change, its financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n\nTaking into account environmental challenges, and in particular climate change, is an integral part of L'Or\u00e9al's business model.\n\nBuilding  on  its  previous  achievements,  the  Group  announced  in  June 2020  a  second  generation  of  particularly  ambitious  and  specific objectives for 2030 as part of its L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. These objectives  cover  the  CO2  emissions  in  Scopes  1,  2  and  3  that  are generated  by  the  Group's  activities,  and  commit  to  a  Science-Based Targets (SBT) approach, so as to track the 1.5\u00b0C trajectory by 2050. These commitments were validated in 2017 by the SBT initiative :\n\n- \u25cf by 2025, all the Group's industrial, administrative and research sites will be  'carbon  neutral' (1) for  Scopes  1  and  2,  using  100%  renewable energy, locally sourced ;\n- \u25cf by 2030, the Group will have reduced all its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value compared to 2016 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3); and\n- \u25cf as a signatory of the UN pledge 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C', L'Or\u00e9al has made a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  commits  that  by  2030  all  water  used  in  the  Group's  industrial processes would be recycled and reused in a loop on its sites, prioritizing the  deployment  of  the  required  equipment  according  to  the  water situation of the watersheds in which L'Or\u00e9al operates. Management of potential consequences of extreme events is described in the section on 'Product availability' risk.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  also  launched  a  programme  entitled  Green Sciences  to  evolve  its  raw  material  portfolio  the  development  of ingredients  with  a  favourable  environmental  profile,  in  minimising  the environmental impacts associated with growing plants sources of these ingredients (deforestation, soil depletion, consequences on biodiversity, for  example),  and  by  relying  on  ecofriendly  processes  that  prevent upstream pollution.\n\nTo  inform  its  consumers  and  enable  them  to  make  more  sustainable consumer  choices,  the  Group  is  developing  an  environmental  and social display system for its products, with a rating ranging from A to E, which takes into account 14 factors of impact for the planet, including greenhouse  gas  emissions.  This  system  is  gradually  being  rolled  out  on the  Group's  haircare  (for  example,  in  20  European  countries,  Mexico and the United States for the Garnier brand) and skincare brands.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's priorities and the main commitments of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme  are  described  in  chapter  4,  which  specifically  comprises the information disclosed in the Non-Financial Performance Statement, including the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al regularly revises its inventory policies, reserves capacities with its suppliers, anticipates  growth  scenarios  and  negotiates  long-term contracts. There are business continuity plans for each operational site. The  Group  is  currently  deploying  a  single  methodology  of  business continuity  plans  at  all  its  factories  and  distribution  centres.  These  plans aim to anticipate supply chain disruption and ensure a timely business continuity.\n\n- L'Or\u00e9al also looks for alternative sourcing of its raw materials, duplicates packaging  moulds  for  its  strategic  products,  implements  operational continuity plans with its suppliers and reviews, if required, the design of its formulas and finished products.\n\nThe  main  suppliers  and  subcontractors  are  asked  to  comply  with  the Letter of Mutual Ethical Commitment, which covers, in particular, Human Rights, working conditions, environmental protection and integrity.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management",

The occurrence of  such events could have a financial, operational and/or eputational impact.\n\n## 3.5.3.3. Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks/Risk of non-conformity\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nMany  general  and  specific  laws  and  regulations  apply  to  the  Group, such  as  the  European  REACH  and  CLP  (Classification,  Labelling, Packaging)  regulations  intended  to  strengthen  the  human  and environmental  safety  of  chemical  products,  the  European  Cosmetics Directive governing  animal  testing  of  ingredients,  legislation  on competition  law,  corruption  and  the  control  of  international  flows, including  economic  sanctions  policies.  The  diversity  and  constant reinforcement of the regulatory environment expose the Group to a risk of non-conformity or increased compliance costs.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al remains exposed to the risk of default or fraud, which could have an  impact  on  its  reputation,  its  business  activities  and  its  results.  In  the ordinary course of its business, the Group will potentially be involved in all types  of  legal  actions  and  may  be  subject  to  tax,  customs  and administrative audits.\n\nIn  accordance  with  its  Code  of  Ethics,  L'Or\u00e9al  attaches  particular importance to compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to it. This  obligation  to  comply  with  local  legislation  is  reaffirmed  in  the Group's  Legal  Charter,  which  sets  out  the  rules  applicable  within  the Group  in  terms  of  contracts,  corporate  law,  intellectual  property  and competition law, embargoes and economic sanctions, and protection of personal data in particular.\n\nTo  ensure  compliance with these rules,  the  Group  has  implemented  a robust  governance  structure  involving  all  of  the  Group's  operational entities  and  support  departments.  This  governance  enables  the  Group to  monitor  legislation  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  to  take  any  measures necessary to comply with it in a timely manner.\n\nTo  ensure  any  embargoes  are  observed,  the  Group  has  put  in  place rules on the terms of delivery and transport of its goods, with the aim of ensuring the control and compliance of formalities in terms of customs imports and exports. Training on customs fundamentals is also delivered to all appropriate employees in the Operations Department. The Group's Legal Department has set up dedicated training courses in competition law for all appropriate employees. L'Or\u00e9al is also involved in an ongoing dialogue with national or regional authorities in charge of specifically  regulating  products  in  its  sector  through  the  professional associations to which it belongs.\n\nWith regard to the REACH and CLP regulations, L'Or\u00e9al communicates proactively  with  its  European  suppliers  in  order  to  ensure  a  continuing supply of compliant raw materials.\n\nAn action plan has been drawn up at L'Or\u00e9al in order to improve the design and methods used to assess the safety of raw materials. It led to the end of testing finished products on animals in 1989 (14 years before it became  a  legal  obligation  in  Europe)  and  the  development  of predictive evaluation strategies to meet European regulations.\n\nIn  the  areas  of  fraud  and  corruption,  the  deployment  to  all  Group subsidiaries of programmes to prevent corruption (see section 4.3.4.) and raise awareness of fraud risk contribute to the management of these risks. In  terms  of  taxation,  the  Group  relies  on  a  tax  policy  and  the  systems\n\ndescribed in section 4.3.5.\n\nThe  Group's  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  policy  aims  to minimise the impact on the environment and guarantee the health and safety  of  employees, customers and the communities in which L'Or\u00e9al carries out its activities. As a result of this policy, the risks inherent in our business  activities  are  systematically  identified  and  brought  under control.\n\nThe Operations Department issues internal rules that set out the principles of  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS  policy.  Each  site  is  covered  by  an  EHS  officer.  EHS  risk management programmes,  methods  and  tools  are  implemented  and the  corresponding  training  is  being  rolled  out  systematically.  EHS performance  indicators  are  collected  monthly  from  all  factories, distribution  centres,  and  administrative  and  research  sites  with  over 50  people.  Specific  audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS  teams,  and external independent experts. The fire risk is controlled by very strict fire prevention standards (National Fire Protection Association standards or equivalent).\n\nIndustrial  sites  classified  as  'Seveso'  are  subject  to  specific  procedures adapted to  the  nature  of  the  risks  related  to  storage  of  chemicals  or flammable materials and are in compliance with the regulations. Since 2020, the Group has extended compliance with the main requirements of the European Seveso Directive beyond the European Union to all sites it operates worldwide.\n\nAcross  all  its  sites,  the  Group  strives  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas emissions,  its  water  consumption  and  its  waste  generation  and  to  limit the  impact  of  its  activity  on  biodiversity.  It  also  pledges  to  reduce  the footprint from transportation of its products and to no longer send waste to landfill.\n\nDetails  of  how  the  risk  relating  to  the  temporary  unavailability  of  an industrial  site  is  managed  are  given  in  the  section  relating  to  'Product availability'.",

'Contingent  liabilities  and significant ongoing disputes' of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The  main  legal  risks  are  reported  to  the  General Management and presented to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks/Intellectual property: trademarks, designs & models, domain names, patents\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  brands,  particularly  the  36  major  international  brands,  designs, models, domain names and patents filed are strategic intangible assets for the Group.\n\nGiven  the  image  and  reputation  of  the  Group  around  the  world  and given the large number of patents (561 in 2022) and trademarks filed by L'Or\u00e9al, third parties could:\n\n- \u25cf dispute the validity of L'Or\u00e9al's intellectual property rights, or attempt to  enforce  their  intellectual  property  rights  against  the  products marketed by L'Or\u00e9al; or\n- \u25cf infringe on L'Or\u00e9al's intellectual property rights, reproduce or imitate the Group's packaging and products in order to benefit illegitimately from the name or associated technologies and thus illegally draw a profit from the efforts and investments made by the Group.\n\nGiven the competitive context in which a growing number of patents and trademarks are filed, and in which some intellectual property rights result  from  acquisitions  or  are  developed  by  third  parties  ('open development'),  the  free  use  of  a  technology  or  full  availability  of  a brand before any launch cannot, therefore, be completely secured by L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks/Product claims\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn  its  communications,  L'Or\u00e9al  highlights  the  innovative  nature,  quality and  performance  of  its  products.  These  communications  may  be challenged  by  authorities,  organisations  or  consumers,  despite  every care used to guarantee their accuracy and fairness. Such actions could affect sales or, more  generally,  the  Group's  financial  position, particularly if claims are made or products recalled.\n\nThe Worldwide Regulatory & Claims Department controls the conformity of product communications before they are introduced on the market. The  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  sets  out  the  fundamental  principles  of responsible  communication  and  L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  to implement  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce  Consolidated Code of  Advertising  and  Marketing  Communication  Practice  and  the Cosmetics  Europe  Charter  and  Guiding  Principles  on  responsible advertising  and  marketing  communication  to  which  the  key  global cosmetics industry players in Europe adhere. The Group's principles for 'responsible product advertising' are described in a summary brochure disseminated  worldwide  in  order  to  raise  employee  awareness  about compliance  with  ethical  principles,  specific  legal  and  regulatory requirements, and operational processes for the prior control of product communications.\n\nSpecial  care  is  given  to  the  protection  of  trademarks,  designs,  models and  domain  names  belonging  to  the  Group.  This  responsibility  is entrusted  to  a  special  unit  of  the  Legal  Department.  The  department ensures  the  worldwide  protection,  management  and  defence  of intellectual  property  rights  via  searches  for  prior  rights,  monitoring  of registration and renewal procedures, the implementation of monitoring services and  the  initiation of appropriate  legal  action  against counterfeiters.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  the  Group  against  the  risk  of  appropriation  of  a molecule,  a  formula,  packaging,  an  application  system  or  an application  by  another  company,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  the  International Industrial Property Department, a specific structure which is part of the Research and Innovation Department.\n\nThis  Department  is  responsible  for  filing  the  Group's  patents,  their  use and defence on a worldwide basis. It also conducts studies on the free use of Group products with regard to third-party patents and monitors the legality of competitors' products with regard to the Group's patents.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  an  active  member  of  organisations  which  have  set themselves  the  goal  of  combating  counterfeiting  and  promoting  best commercial  practices.  This  is  the  case  of  the  UNIFAB  (Union  des Fabricants), the APRAM (Association des Praticiens du Droit des Marques et des Mod\u00e8les) and the AIM.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management",

Financial and market risks\n\n## Financial and market risks/Inflation and currency risk\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nDue  to  its  international  presence,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  naturally  exposed  to currency  fluctuations.  In  addition,  commercial  flows  resulting  from purchases  and  sales  of  items,  products,  royalties  and  services  arise between subsidiaries in different countries. Procurement by subsidiaries is mainly in the currency of the supplier's country.\n\nFluctuations  between  the  main  currencies  may  therefore  have  an impact on the results of the subsidiaries, but also on the Group's results during the conversion of non-euro subsidiaries' accounts into euros and, as  a  result,  make  it  difficult  to  compare  performances  between  two financial years.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the inflation situation,  the  Group  is  exposed to increased volatility in global currencies and to an increase in the cost of its supplies, in particular.\n\nThe  impact  of  hedging  on  equity  and  the  analysis  of  sensitivity  to currency fluctuations  are  detailed  in  note  11.3.  'Other  comprehensive income' in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Finally, the impact of foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  the  income  statement  is described  in  note  10.2.  'Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses'  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial and market risks/Financial equity risk\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe main equity risk for L'Or\u00e9al is the 9.38% stake it held in Sanofi at 31 December  2022  (see  note  9.3.  'Non-current  financial  assets'  of  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements),  the  value  of  which  fluctuates primarily as a function of global market trends, Sanofi's results and, more generally, economic and financial data from Sanofi and its sector.\n\nThis  interest  and  changes  in  the  market  in  which  Sanofi  operates  are monitored on a regular basis. As at 31 December 2022, the market value of the Sanofi share was significantly higher than the value recorded on the L'Or\u00e9al balance sheet (see note 9.3. 'Non-current financial assets' to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nA significant decrease in the amount of the dividend paid by Sanofi, or a  significant  or  extended  decline  in  its  market  price,  could  have  an impact on L'Or\u00e9al's share price.\n\n## Financial and market risks/Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's intangible assets, which are primarily its 36 major international brands,  and  the  goodwill  recognised  at  the  time  of  external  growth transactions, are susceptible to impairment.\n\nAs detailed in note 7. 'Intangible assets' of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  brands  with  an  indefinite  useful  life  and  goodwill  are  not amortised but are tested for periodic impairment at least once a year. Where the  recoverable  amount  of  a  brand  is  lower  than  its  net  book value,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised.  Similarly,  any  difference between the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit and the net  book  value  of  the  assets  including  goodwill  would  lead  to  an impairment  loss  in  respect  of  the  asset,  recorded  in  the  income statement. This is reported to the Audit Committee. The amounts for the last  three  financial  years  are  provided  in  note  4.  'Other  operational income and expenses' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  data  and  assumptions  used  in  impairment  tests  carried  out  on Cash-Generating  Units  for  which  the  goodwill  and  non-amortisable brands are significant,  are  presented  in  note  7.3.  'Impairment  tests  on intangible assets' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Treasury and Finance Charter specifies, in particular, the principles to be applied by Group entities to ensure that management of currency risk is both prudent and centralised.\n\nTo  limit  currency  risk,  the  Group  applies  a  predetermined  strategy whereby it hedges a significant portion of its annual requirements for the following year through currency forward contracts (purchases or sales) or  through  options.  Hedging  requirements  are  established  for  the following  year  on  the  basis  of  operating  budgets  of  each  subsidiary. These requirements are then reviewed regularly throughout the year in progress and the hedging is adjusted. In order to obtain better visibility over  the  flows  generated,  the  management  of  currency  risk  is centralised  through  the  Treasury  and  Finance  Department  at  head office (part of the Group Corporate Finance Department), which uses a specific  tool  for  centralising  the  subsidiaries'  requirements  by  currency (FX report).\n\nThe system of foreign exchange risk hedging is presented to the Audit Committee.  The  hedging  methodology  and  the  equities  involved  are described in note 10.1. 'Hedging of currency risk' of the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  It  is  adjusted  according  to  the  economic  and financial situation.\n\nIn addition, the management tools developed can be used to mitigate the impact of inflationary tensions through product valuation strategies and sourcing adaptation strategies.",

This  chapter  forms  the  Group's  Non-Financial  Performance Statement.\n\n## 4.1. Introduction\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's strategy is based on Glocalisation ,  that is  to  say the globalisation of its brands, with a detailed understanding and respect for local differences to meet the beauty expectations and needs of women and men around the world, while at the same time being an environmental and societal leader.\n\n## Sustainable development for sustained success\n\nFor  many  years  now,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  evolving  its  model  to address the world's major changes, and sustainable development  has  been  a  key  pillar  of  this  transformation. L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  this  a  strategic  priority.  Consequently, management  as  a  whole  and  all  its  teams  implement  an ambitious CSR policy.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  the  second  generation  of  its sustainable development commitments (1) ,  under the umbrella of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme.  It  includes  new ambitious and concrete objectives for 2030 in order to cover all  of  the  Group's  impacts.  These  include  both  the  impacts associated with its value chain, from production to distribution, as well as those related to its sourcing or the use of products by consumers.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Group  also  undertook  to  define  Science-Based Targets  (SBT).  The  objective  is  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas emissions  across  its  value  chain  and  over  the  long  term  in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In December 2017, the SBT initiative  validated  the  commitment proposed  by  the  Group:  to  reduce  its  Scope  1,  2,  and  3 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value by 2030, compared to the 2016 baseline.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  which  is  subject  to public reporting every year, is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 transforming  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities  within  the  context  of 'planetary  boundaries' (what  the  planet  can  support according to environmental science);\n- \u00b7 involving  L'Or\u00e9al's  business  ecosystem  in  the  Group's transformation and helping the Group's transition to a more sustainable model ; and\n- \u00b7 contributing  to  solving  the  challenges  of  the  world by supporting the most urgent social and environmental needs.\n\n## CSR governance\n\nTo  support  this  process,  the  Group  has  developed  a  strong governance structure.\n\nEvery  year,  the Board  of  Directors determines  L'Or\u00e9al's strategic orientations. These orientations integrate the\n\nchallenges of climate change and, more generally, sustainable development matters as well as the Group's sense of  purpose  to  'Create  the  beauty  that  moves  the  world'.  In order to monitor the determination and successful implementation  of  these  strategic  directions,  the  Board  of Directors  can  rely  on  its  four Board  Committees ,  which  are responsible  for  investigating  the  matters  within  their  area  of expertise  in  the  determination  and  monitoring  of  the  nonfinancial  strategy  (see  section  2.3.4.).  Every  year,  the  Chief Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  reports  on  the  Group's activities  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and  takes  part  to  the meetings of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee. Before each meeting, the members of the Board of Directors receive a status update on the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme that details its specific advances. In 2022, the Directors took a CSR training course (see section 2.3.2.).\n\nThe  comprehensive  transformation  plan  affects  all  Divisions, Zones  and  support  functions.  To  implement  it,  the  Chief Executive  Officer  can  rely  on  the  commitment  of  every member  of  the  Executive  Committee in their field of responsibility. He works together with the Executive Committee to implement the strategic directions on non-financial matters. Status  updates  on  sustainable  development  matters  are provided  regularly  in  order  to  define  and  implement  the necessary action plans. A network of sustainable development Coordinators , made  up  of  members  of  the  Management Committees,  is  responsible  for  the  deployment  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for the Future in each Division, Zone and entity.\n\nWithin the Executive Committee,  the Chief Corporate Responsibility  Officer ensures  strategic  consistency  between the  measures  the  Group  takes  to  integrate  sustainable development  across  its  entire  value  chain  and  its  charitable contributions.  She  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  and implementation  of  the  sustainable  development  strategy, and assesses and manages risks and opportunities related to environmental and societal challenges at Group level through the action plans implemented.\n\nUnder  her  direction,  different internal  Committees  related  to sustainable development define the roadmaps for each of the entities  represented  (Operations,  Research,  Divisions,  Zones). The  experts  responsible  for  the  rollout  of  the  programme participate  in  these  Committees.  Each  Committee  defines annual  objectives  and  manages  their  rollout  throughout  the value chain.\n\nTwice a year, the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer brings together  some  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  in  the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Executive Committee to  make strategic decisions about the programme.",

        "page_content": "Introduction\n\nCreated  in  2020,  the  mission  of  the Sustainable  Finance Department is to integrate the environmental challenges from a financial standpoint. It reports to the Chief Financial Officer and  to  the  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer.  It  aims  to develop  and  then  manage  Sustainable  Finance  actions  by coordinating  actions  within  the  finance  teams  and  further incorporating  sustainable  development  into  investment  and acquisition decisions.\n\n## A strategic transformation driven by all\n\nSustainable  development  must  be  driven  by  all  teams. All L'Or\u00e9al employees are encouraged to receive training on the challenges of sustainable development. They have access to a comprehensive range of online training courses available in 15 languages as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme.\n\nRemuneration  structures  have  been  revised  at  the  highest level.  The variable  portion  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's annual remuneration incorporates quantitative and qualitative non-financial  objectives,  including  objectives  associated  with the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (and  previously  the Sharing Beauty with All programme). In order to ensure strong correlation  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  for  which  economic  and social performance go hand-in-hand, the long-term remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer includes criteria for non-financial performance in addition to financial performance (see  section  2.4.).  Moreover,  non-financial  objectives  in  line with the Group's goals for sustainability have since 2016 been\n\n## CSR governance\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nDefines the strategic orientations while taking CSR, including the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, into account\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER member of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nincluding the Chief Corporate Responsibility O/fficer and CEO of the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al\n\nImplements the Group's comprehensive transformation plan in the Divisions, Geographic Zones and support functions\n\nInternal committees related to sustainable development\n\n\u00b7Divisions\n\n\u00b7Scientific\n\n\u00b7Zones\n\n## 4 BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nincluding the Strategy and Sustainability Committee (5 meetings in 2021)\n\nMake CSR recommendations in their respective areas of competency to the Board of Directors (see section 2.3.4)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al for the Future Committee at Executive Committee level\n\nmade up of members of the Executive Committee\n\nSustainability Leaders network\n\nincluded in the variable remuneration of the top management,  including  international  brand  managers  and country managers.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  ongoing  dialogue  and  as  part  of a  process  which  aims  at  making  continual  progress,  L'Or\u00e9al takes  into  account its  stakeholders'  expectations . With  a representative panel of outside experts around the world, the Group  has  defined  and  developed  a  method  of  ad-hoc interaction  that  it  considers  to  be  the  most  efficient  and appropriate.  It  has  also  set  up  bodies  for  important  issues, for  example in the form of a Women's Advisory Board. These bodies  aim  to ensure  that  civil  society's  expectations  are sufficiently met  with  regard  to  these  issues.  The  main stakeholder interactions are set out in section 4.1.2.\n\nThe  Group is  convinced  that  acting  ethically  is  the  only  way to  achieve  sustainable  success.  In  order  to  ensure  that strong  Ethical  Principles  -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency - continue to guide the development of L'Or\u00e9al and  contribute  to  establishing  its  reputation,  the  Chief Executive  Officer  can  also  rely  on  the Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Officer , who reports directly to him.\n\nIn  2022,  true  to  its  commitment  to  the  Ten  Principles  of  the UN Global Compact, L'Or\u00e9al participated in the Early Adopter programme.  This  involvement  highlights  its  contribution  to the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  which  are  at  the centre of its growth strategy.\n\nNon-financial objectives in line with the sustainability goals included in the annual variable remuneration and long-term incentive(LTI) plans of the top management including the Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

This analysis was carried out by an external third party (1) and  is  based  on  the  double  materiality  principle established by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and fully enshrined  in  the  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive (CSRD) (2) . It was  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  draft sustainability reporting standards submitted for consultation in April  2022  (ESRS) (3) . These  standards  define  materiality  in relation  to  two  different  dimensions:  financial  materiality  (the impact of sustainability issues on the development, position or financial performance of a company); and impact materiality (the impact of a company on people or the environment).\n\nIdentification,  evaluation  and  ranking  of  issues: First, an analysis  of  the  key  environmental,  social  and  governance (ESG)  topics  was  conducted,  regardless  of  whether  these topics are covered by the ESRS or are specific to L'Or\u00e9al or the beauty sector.  24  material  issues  were  identified.  These  were then  subjected  to  a  double  materiality  assessment  (financial materiality and impact materiality) through:\n\n- 1. a documentary  review to  incorporate  materiality  and financial  impact  data  as  well  as  the  perspectives  of  a large  number  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  stakeholders,  in  particular  by\n\ntaking  into  account  the  opinions  of:  employees,  via  the annual  Pulse  survey  on  L'Or\u00e9al  employee  engagement; consumers,  through  consumer  surveys  conducted  by L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  external  third  party;  investors,  via  the review  of  international  standards  (SASB (4) in  particular) and  non-financial  rating  agencies,  including  MSCI,  S&P Global, Moody's ESG Solutions, Sustainalytics; sustainability experts,  through  surveys  relating  to  the  business  world, public policy and civil society;\n\n- 2. interviews  with  internal  and  external  ESG experts  (clients, investors, representatives of civil society, NGOs, professional associations).\n\nFollowing this analysis, the issues were classified in accordance with the extent of their financial and impact materiality.\n\nResults  and  action  plans: All  the  issues  reported  in  the  matrix are  the  subject  of  internal  action  plans,  implemented  in particular within the framework of programmes such as L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future  or  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care.  The  results  of  this analysis  were  shared  with  the  Audit  Committee  and  the Executive Committee in 2022. The double materiality matrix is intended to be updated regularly, particularly with regard to the final version of the ESRS, which is set to be adopted by the European Commission in June 2023.\n\n| Main ESG issues                                                                                                                         | Examples of policies and action plans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Document section                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Environmental issues:  circular  economy,  preservation of natural  resources (packaging,  formulas), climate,  water and biodiversity. | 'Transforming our business' pillar of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme:  \u25cf Climate : Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sites, strategic suppliers,  products transportation and consumers; \u25cf Water:  formulas with zero impact on the diversity of aquatic ecosystems,  water recycled or reused in a loop; \u25cf Biodiversity:  100% of ingredients in traceable and sustainably sourced | 1.3.2.

Constant dialogue with stakeholders\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  ongoing  dialogue  and  as  part  of  a process aimed at making continual progress, L'Or\u00e9al endeavours to take into account its stakeholders' expectations in  its  strategy.  The  Group  has  defined  and  developed  a method  of  ad-hoc  interaction,  that  it  considers  the  most efficient and appropriate, for all the stakeholders involved. The dialogue  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  with  its  stakeholders  has grown in importance over time.\n\nConsulted throughout the Group's first sustainability programme, Sharing  Beauty  with  All,  they  were  then  involved  in  both the  definition  of  commitments  and  during  their  follow-up.\n\nFrom April  2019,  seven  internal  expert  groups  came  together to  prepare  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  for  2030.

Main non-financial risks\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  presents  its  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  strategy (1) in  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Non-Financial Information  Statement (2) in  particular.  This  Statement  sets  out the Group's main non-financial risks and describes the policies implemented to address them.\n\nPerformance indicators follow and measure these policies and their  results.  This  presentation  refers  to  the  Group's  business model,  set  out  in  section  1.2.  As  L'Or\u00e9al  has  had  a long-standing commitment to CSR, section 4.3. also incorporates the policies and actions voluntarily implemented beyond a response to the main risks.\n\n## 4.2.1. Risk identification process\n\nThe main environmental and social risks, the main risks related to Human Rights and the main corruption risks (3) are detailed (4) to  the  extent  necessary  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the Company's  position,  business  development,  economic  and financial results, and impacts of its activity.\n\nChapter  3  presents  the  Group's  significant  risks,  i.e.  risks  that cover all areas of the Group's activities and that could have a material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  position  or  outlook. They have been established in conjunction with the Group risk mapping (see section 3.5.2.).\n\nSome of these risks are specific to non-financial issues. Others are  broader  and  may  stem  from  environmental  or  societal causes: these are the CSR risks. The principal ones have been selected within the meaning of the NFIS following a detailed\n\nanalysis.  This  analysis  was  carried  out  based  on  the  work of  Group  experts,  in  conjunction  with  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department and in compliance with the Group's business model. This work also draws on the double materiality analysis, the climate study on environmental risks, the Group's Human  Rights  and  corruption  mapping,  and  corruption mapping conducted for each country. It takes into account the  risk  analysis  carried  out  in  connection  with  the  Vigilance Plan (see section 3.4.).\n\nThe  risks  associated  with  climate  change  are  subject  to  a long-term approach - more than 10 years - given their specific nature.  The  main  risks  have  been  validated  at  the  highest level  of  responsibility  of  the  organisation  by  the  relevant General Managements.\n\n## 4.2.2. Main risks for corporate social responsibility, Human Rights and corruption\n\nThe main risks in respect of CSR, Human Rights and corruption identified  by  the  Group  are  detailed  below.  Other  risks, of which the Group is not currently aware or which it does not consider material at present, could have a negative impact. The  approach  is  based  on  double  materiality:  the  concept\n\nof  risk  covers  both  risks  related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's business activities on its ecosystem and the risks of the impact of  climate  change  in  the  short  and  medium-term  on  its business model, activity and financial performance (5) .\n\n## Main environmental risks\n\n## Industrial risks\n\nAs with any production, distribution, research and general administration activity, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to a variety of industrial risks that may impact the  environment  and  safety:  fires,  explosions,  technical  failure  of  facilities,  safety  system  installations,  or  even  human  failure  in  the  operation of  existing  facilities  (such  as  those  dedicated  to  the  treatment  of  wastewater  and/or  their  discharge),  or  when  managing  exceptional  works. These events can generate accidental pollution (surface and underground water, air, soils, etc.) and have consequences inside or outside the sites, which are sometimes located near an inhabited area.\n\n## Physical and transition risks associated with climate change\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks of natural origin in many countries. Risks of natural origin are those related to the occurrence of extreme weather events such  as  cyclones  or  floods,  or  those  resulting  from  long-term  climate  change  such  as  the  rise  in  average  temperatures,  noticeable  change in precipitation levels and the reduction of available water. The increase in these risks could impact the availability of finished products by disturbing the Group's operations and/or supply chain. To be sold, the products manufactured by the Group must be available on the market on the dates scheduled to respect consumer demands and launch plans, in a cosmetics market where the need for responsiveness is growing constantly. A major stoppage of activity at a factory or distribution centre could therefore have an adverse effect on the achievement of commercial objectives.\n\nThese risks may impact the Group directly on its sites, or indirectly via the sites of suppliers and subcontractors, thereby reducing the availability of raw materials or filling and packaging components necessary to manufacture products. For instance, an exceptionally steep rise in the price of basic raw materials because of their scarcity, or in the energy costs necessary for their production due to carbon taxation, or even their total unavailability or the resulting failure of suppliers, could affect the Group's performance..\n\n## Risks related to the use and end of life of products\n\nThe  use  of  cosmetics  and  their  disposal  after  use  by  consumers  and  professional  customers  (mainly  hairdressers  and  beauticians)  generate environmental impacts. So-called 'rinsed' formulas, shampoos in particular, require water for their use, and the ingredients used in their composition can be found after use in domestic wastewater. The treatment of this water is dependent on existing sanitation systems in place in the relevant geographic areas. Insufficient  consideration  of  these  impacts  related  to  the  usage  phase  during  the  design  of  products  could  represent  a  risk in certain areas of the world affected by water stress or the lack of adapted infrastructures for the collection and treatment of wastewater. Similarly, the use of predominantly plastic containers may represent an environmental risk with regard to the disposal of plastic waste, depending largely on the collection and treatment channels available.",

        "page_content": "## Main environmental risks\n\n## Risk related to changing stakeholder and consumer expectations in terms of environmental performance\n\nThe  choices  made  by  certain  categories  of  consumers  may  be  increasingly  influenced  by  the  impact  associated  with  the  use  of  a  product (its  carbon  footprint,  its  water  footprint,  its  impact  on  biodiversity)  and  by  the  Group's  overall  environmental  performance,  particularly  in  terms of  reducing  its  CO2  emissions  in  all  Scopes.  If  the  Group  is  unable  to  anticipate  changes  in  such  behaviours,  meet  stakeholders'  expectations, overcome major environmental and social challenges and respond in particular with appropriate product innovation, a significant contribution in the transition towards a low carbon economy and the preservation of water, natural resources and biodiversity within its value chain, the Group's performance and reputation could be affected.\n\n## Risk of regulatory non-conformity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates through subsidiaries located in many countries. Like any international business, L'Or\u00e9al is subject to a wide range of constantly changing local laws and regulations in the areas of safety and the environment. This mainly concerns the fight against climate change, and the preservation of water resources, biodiversity and natural resources. This exposes it to the risk of regulatory non-compliance or higher compliance costs for its activities in a global context of increasingly diverse norms.\n\n## Main social risks\n\n## Employee health and safety risk\n\nGiven L'Or\u00e9al's activities, particularly its industrial operations, the risk of occupational injuries or illnesses could become a reality. Psychosocial risks, exacerbated by the effects of the Covid-19 health crisis, may affect employees' mental health. This could also have an adverse impact on their commitment and, consequently, on the Group's performance.\n\n## Human resources management risk\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is changing within a complex, highly competitive and rapidly changing environment (globalisation, diversity and inclusion challenges, sustainable development issues, acceleration  of  the  digital  transformation  etc.)  that  requires  specific  expertise.  The  Covid-19  health  crisis  has  left  a  significant  mark  on  the  job market, with new employee expectations regarding working methods, particularly with the introduction of a sustainable hybrid mode, alternating between  on-site  and  remote  working.  If  L'Or\u00e9al  fails  to  identify,  attract,  recruit,  retain  and  develop  competent  and  involved  employees who behave responsibly within diverse teams, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\n## Main Human Rights risks\n\nThe Group expanded its mapping by identifying the potential key Human Rights risks worldwide and in all markets. L'Or\u00e9al relied on the reporting framework of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP Reporting Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale and remediability, as well as the likelihood of its impacts for people throughout its value chain. This study was conducted with an NGO specialised in the area, providing independent analysis. The main risks are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of L'Or\u00e9al's employees (discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation);\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of L'Or\u00e9al's suppliers' employees (child labour, forced labour, discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation, and lack of a living wage);\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of consumers (failure in the quality and safety of products, and lack of protection of personal data); and\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of communities (stereotypes in advertising).\n\nAnother risk identified concerns the Human Rights of communities potentially impacted by the Group's activities (respect for the environment, right of access to water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials, and in particular, the right of access of local populations to their land and respect for their traditional knowledge under the Nagoya Protocol).\n\n## Main corruption risks\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates in many countries where the risk of corruption can be significant and could lead L'Or\u00e9al's employees, as well as third parties acting in its  name or on its behalf, directly or indirectly, voluntarily  or  involuntarily,  to  adopt  practices  contrary  to  the  Group's  ethical  principles and  the  prevailing  regulations.  Corruption  takes  a  variety  of  forms  that  are  not  necessarily  easy  for  employees  to  identify.  For  instance, the exchange of gifts or invitations of excessive value could be perceived as corruption.\n\nThe  assessment  of  corruption  risk  is  materialised  by  specific  mapping,  carried  out  at  the  Group  level  and  by  each  country  in  its  local  context. The Group's activities involve in particular relations with:\n\n- \u25cf public  authorities  and  their  representatives,  either  directly  or  via  intermediaries  or  professional  bodies,  to  obtain  the  authorisations  necessary for the Group's activities, for instance. The countries in which the Group operates must be given support in the fight against public corruption;\n- \u25cf the Group's customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf journalists, doctors, etc., to whom products can be given so that they can recommend them. Relationships are also maintained with third parties that, beyond the Group's products themselves, issue various or general opinions on L'Or\u00e9al. Any action potentially deemed as being intended to cause the persons in question to breach their obligation of loyalty must be avoided.\n\nAny breach of the Group's corruption prevention principles may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al and its partners. Equally, any failure of a partner may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe Group's policies address the need to prevent and mitigate the  occurrence  of  the  main  CSR  risks and  aim  to contribute to its sustainable growth in a control environment aligned with its  businesses. There are however limits inherent in any system and process. These limits result from several factors, such as the uncertainties  of  the  outside  world,  or  issues  resulting  from technical  or  human  failures.  These  policies  also  reflect  a proactive  approach  by  the  Group  to  consider  stakeholder expectations (see section 4.1.2.).\n\n## 4.3.1. An ambitious environmental policy\n\nThe  Group  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  reducing  its environmental footprint and aims to be one of the best-rated companies  in  this  area .  L'Or\u00e9al  wishes  to  prove  that  it  is possible to decorrelate growth and environmental impact and to contribute positively to its ecosystem throughout the world.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  launches  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme, based on four pillars: 'Innovating sustainably', 'Producing sustainably', 'Living sustainably' and 'Developing sustainably'.\n- \u00b7 In  2016,  the  Working  Sustainably  programme  is  rolled  out within  Sharing  Beauty  with  All  to  integrate  administrative sites  and  research  centres  within  the  improvement  of environmental and social impacts.\n- \u00b7 In 2017, L'Or\u00e9al joins the Science-Based Targets programme,  an  initiative  of  the  CDP,  the  United  Nations Global  Compact,  the  World  Resources  Institute,  and  the NGO WWF. The Group thereby plans to reduce its overall greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25%  compared  with  2016 by the end of 2030.\n- \u00b7 In  2018,  to  progress  further  with  regard  to  the  individual Act4nature commitments,  L'Or\u00e9al  sets  a  goal  of  ensuring that  100%  of  its  raw  materials  are  renewable  and  come from sustainable sources by 2030.\n- \u00b7 In 2018, L'Or\u00e9al becomes a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,  with  the  aim  of  adopting  refillable,  reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic for 100% of packaging by 2025.\n- \u00b7 In 2019, L'Or\u00e9al becomes one of the first companies to sign the 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' Pledge of the UN Global Compact. The Group thereby commits to reaching zero net emissions by 2050 over its entire value chain, in accordance with the 1.5\u00b0C pathways of the IPCC (1) .\n- \u00b7 In June  2020,  the  Group  announces  the  follow-up sustainable development programme to the Sharing Beauty With All programme: L'Or\u00e9al for the Future. It sets a second generation of particularly ambitious and specific objectives for  2030  with  regard  to  efforts  to  combat  climate  change and  preserve  natural  resources.  These  cover  all  impacts associated with the Group's value chain and its sites: from the  search  for  renewable  ingredients  and  the  sustainable sourcing of raw materials to the transportation of products, their consumption, and their end of life.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitment is to ensure that its activities respect the 'planetary  boundaries',  meaning  what  the  planet  can withstand, as defined by environmental science.\n\n| INDICATORS AND PRINCIPAL RESULTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | POLICY                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| a worldwide organisation and a unique reference manual; training in EHS policy and practices: 6,865 people trained worldwide; a worldwide audit programme: 38 EHS audits; a  continuous  improvement  process: 35  ISO  14001  certifications,  27  ISO  50001  certifications, 34 ISO 45001 certifications (factory scope); a process of systematic integration of new sites.                                                                                | An ambitious EHS policy shared by all                                    |\n| an environmental analysis conducted on a regular basis and whenever a significant change occurs; consideration of biodiversity and land use in the design or operation of sites; monitoring of surface water: no accidental spill; monitoring of the wastewater leaving factories: wastewater quality index (0.34 g COD/FP) \u2611 ; monitoring of air emissions, excluding greenhouse gases: 0.1 t of SO2; 156 t of VOC (in 2021); monitoring of noise pollution. | Managing risks and controlling the impact  of sites on their environment |",

Indeed,  the  Group  strives  to  ensure  the regulatory compliance of its activities and compliance with its standards on its sites (industrial or administrative sites, research centres, stores).

Every site  operated  by  the  Group  can  refer  to  it  using  the  EHS manual.  While  knowledge  of  and  compliance  with  these procedures are fundamental, the lasting improvement of the safety  results  and  environmental  performance  requires  in particular  the  dissemination  of  a  sustainable  EHS  culture  to every  employee.  The  Group  implements  large  programmes of  actions  to  improve  the  safety  and  environmental  impact of its activities. A dedicated training programme ensures that this  EHS  culture  is  spread  to  every  level  of  the  organisation.\n\nLastly,  a  context-appropriate  audit  system  combining  both  a 'risk'  and  a  'culture'  evaluation  assesses  the  compliance  of activities  with  the  key  regulatory  requirements,  the  proper application of the Group's standards, and the spread of the EHS culture.\n\n## A worldwide organisation\n\nUnder the responsibility of Operations, EHS is organised in line with the Group's worldwide organisation. It includes a Group 'M\u00e9tier'  (business  activity)  Department,  mirror  organisations in each geographic zone, and managers at each site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) South Asia, Pacific, Middle East, North Africa.\n\n| General Management                                                                        | The  Chief  Operations  Officer,  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee  who  reports  to  the  Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the Environment, Health and Safety for the Group.                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Site managers (factories,  distribution centres, administrative sites,  research centres) | Site managers are responsible for the deployment and effective implementation of the policies defined.

In  particular, it covers:\n\n- \u00b7 the safety of people and property;\n- \u00b7 fire protection;\n- \u00b7 maintenance and work;\n- \u00b7 pollution risks;\n- \u00b7 efficiency  of  the  use  of  resources,  water  and  energy consumption;\n\n- \u00b7 preservation of biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 greenhouse  gas  emissions,  wastewater  discharges,  waste generation and treatment.\n\nThis EHS policy is accompanied by monthly reporting based on detailed  indicators.  These  indicators  enable  changes  in  the results for each area above to be monitored, and anomalies and incidents to be reported.\n\nThe  EHS  manual  is  rolled  out  at  all  industrial  sites,  research centres,  administrative  sites,  free-standing  stores  and  points of sale.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  help  to  establish  risk  identification  and  control  systems, and to embed the EHS culture at the Group's sites,  with  the following main objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 defining and sharing the EHS vision, challenges, and values across the Group;\n- \u00b7 enabling managers to implement the EHS policy effectively within their entities;\n- \u00b7 identifying  the  EHS  risks  inherent  in  a  role,  task,  behaviour, or  the  use  of  equipment,  and  establishing  appropriate preventive and corrective measures; and\n- \u00b7 enabling managers to identify, in their activities, the actions that help to improve the EHS performance of their site.\n\n| TRAINING                                                               | OBJECTIVE                               | PROFILES CONCERNED                                                                                    | 2022 RESULTS                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Guaranteeing a high level  of expertise for EHS managers  in the Group | EHS teams                               | 52 people trained worldwide                                                                           | EHS Excellence                                  |\n| Training managers in the EHS  culture of their unit                    | Top managers Operations Directors (DOP) | 85 people trained worldwide 11 people trained worldwide                                               | Leadership & Safety culture  Mastering DOP role |\n| Training managers in the EHS  culture of their unit                    | Managers and operational supervisors    | 189 people trained worldwide                                                                          | EHS Operations & Labs                           |\n| Training in health and safety  issues specific to Operations  sites    | Experts, managers and employees         | 33 experts and 1350 employees  trained (managers, technicians, etc.) 5 EHS people trained as trainers | Ergonomic Attitude programme                    |\n\nThe 2020 Covid-19 health crisis inspired the Group to adapt its EHS training programme. A substantial overhaul was conducted to enable it to be monitored remotely. Webinars were  rolled  out  through  which  EHS  programmes  could  be presented.  The  'Green  steps  for  all'  training  programme  in particular  has  brought  awareness  of  the  challenges  related to  climate,  water,  biodiversity,  and  resources  to  17,559 Operations employees since 2021.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specialised  training  sessions,  every  new L'Or\u00e9al  employee  receives  general  and  specific  training  at their  workstation  on  the  Group's  EHS  rules  before  taking  up their position.\n\n## A worldwide audit programme\n\nTo ensure compliance with the Group's EHS policy, a system of worldwide  audits  has  been  in  place  since  1996.  Since  2001, this has been reinforced by the presence of external auditors, who are experts in local contexts and regulations. These audits take  place  regularly  at  L'Or\u00e9al  sites:  every  three  years  for production  sites  and  every  four  years  for  distribution  centres, administrative  sites,  and  research  centres.  A  follow-up  visit  is scheduled for the following year if necessary.\n\nThere  are  two  types  of  audits:  'risk'  and  'culture'  audits. They  are  performed  depending  on  the  maturity,  and  type of activity at the sites.\n\nRisk  audits  are  carried  out  by  external  and  independent experts. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u25cf compliance  of  practices  and  facilities  with  the  significant requirements  of  local  regulations,  and  Group  procedures and rules;\n- \u25cf control  of  risks  to  health,  safety  and  the  environment generated by technical equipment, processes and operating modes available for use by employees; and\n- \u25cf progress in environmental, health, and safety performances.\n\nThe  results of these  audits  give  the  Group's  General Management objective knowledge of the risks in the areas of EHS on L'Or\u00e9al sites and provide the assurance that they are under control.\n\nCulture  audits  are  carried  out  by  internal  EHS  specialists through  interviews  with  at  least  20%  to  30%  of  the  site's workforce. The leadership of site management, all operational managers and the deployment level of the EHS culture with all employees are evaluated.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  provide  information  on  the knowledge of EHS management tools and the maturity of sites with  regard  to  the  safety  and  environment  culture  at  all structural levels.\n\nDepending  on  the  case,  EHS  audits  are  exclusively  risk or culture audits, audits that combine risks and culture, or even audits that combine risks, culture, quality and performance.\n\nFurthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  with  its subcontractors  the objective  of  improving  EHS  performance.  Audits  are  carried out by independent third-party specialists in addition to social audits.  They  are  conducted  on  manufacturing  or  logistics subcontracting  sites,  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  defined by L'Or\u00e9al and similar to those used for the Group's entities.\n\nIn 2022, the following EHS audits were conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 20 risk audits;\n- \u00b7 8 combined risk and EHS culture audits;\n- \u00b7 7  combined  Quality,  Environment,  Health,  Safety  and Performance audits and 3 combined Quality, Environment, Health and Safety audits;\n- \u00b7 66 additional EHS audits of subcontracting sites in factories, and 19 in external distribution centres.\n\nIn  addition,  annual prevention inspections are conducted by experts  from  the  Group's  insurance  companies  as  part  of external  Fire  and  Environment  insurance  policies.  In  2022, 11  sites  (8  factories,  2  distribution  centres,  and  1  research centre)  were  inspected  for  environmental  risks  in  8  countries. In 2022, fire prevention inspections were carried out at 3 plants in France, and 11 sites worldwide.\n\nAll preventive  audits  and  inspections  mentioned  above involved  a  risk  component  which  is  always  carried  out  by external  independent  auditors  specialised  in  the  area  being audited.",

Major  developments  occurring  within  the framework  of  the  Group's  Operations  are  also  included with  this  same  goal.  The  construction  of  a  new  factory, the  purchase  of  new  equipment  or  the  definition  of  new processes are also opportunities to reduce the environmental footprint and safety risks.\n\nLastly, some major programmes within EHS, or more generally within the Group, are vectors for progress in the areas of safety or  the  environment  for  all  entities.  They  are  therefore  the subject  of  detailed  improvement  plans,  the  effectiveness of which is evaluated during the audits.\n\n## LIFE ( Life-threatening Incidents or Fatality Events ) programme\n\nFor  all  L'Or\u00e9al  sites,  it  covers  activities  posing  risks  that,  if  not controlled, could result in serious injury  or  illness.  The  Group  is prolonging the ambition of moving towards 'zero accidents' by  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  actions  and  defining  the requirements in terms of preparing for emergencies following an incident.  It  is  backed  up  by  a  three-year  communication campaign  relayed  by  managers  to  cover  the  10  identified families of LIFE risks.\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme\n\nWith  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed  to improving  the  environmental  footprint  of  its operated sites (production and distribution sites, administrative sites and research centres).\n\nThe  main  environmental  objectives  of  the  programme  for operated sites are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 climate :  reaching  'carbon  neutral' (1) status  for  all  sites  by 2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and  using  100% renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 water :  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be recycled and reused in a loop;\n- \u00b7 biodiversity :  by  2030,  all  of  our  operated  buildings  and industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared to 2019; and\n- \u00b7 natural  resources :  by  2030,  100%  of  the  waste  generated in  our  operated  sites  will  be  reused  or  recycled.  L'Or\u00e9al  is also committed to no longer send waste to landfills.\n\nThe Group is committed to an ISO certification process in order to  permanently  anchor  EHS  performance  on  its  production sites:\n\n- \u00b7 since 2003, L'Or\u00e9al has committed to ISO 14001 'Environmental  Management'  certification  in  all  of  its factories;\n- \u00b7 in 2015,  the  Group  launched  an ISO  50001 'Energy Management'  certification  programme  with  the  goal  of certifying  all  its  factories  in  accordance  with  a  clearly defined roadmap. Other sites (distribution centres, administrative  sites and  research  centres)  have  also launched this process; and\n- \u00b7 since  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to OHSAS  18001 certification, and then ISO 45001 'Occupational Health and Safety Management' certification in all of its factories.\n\n| 2022 Certifications   | ISO 14001       | ISO 14001   | ISO 50001         | ISO 50001       | ISO 45001   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|                       | Number of sites | %           | Number of sites % | Number of sites | %           |\n| Factories             | 35              | 92          | 27  71            | 34              | 89          |\n\nAn  internal  communication  system  exists  to  inform  each  site when  accidents,  near  misses  or  significant  incidents  occur. Specific  communication  is  circulated  worldwide  to  raise awareness of  the  facts  and  lessons  to  be  learnt,  the  existing rules  and  the  new  requirements  to  be  applied.  Finally,  each site  is  provided  with  an  historical  record  which  covers  the nature and root causes of EHS incidents/accidents that have occurred in all sites.\n\n## A process of integrating new sites\n\nThe  Group  regularly  acquires  new  sites.  A  formal  integration process  ensures  that these  sites (2) are  provided  with  extra\n\nsupport and assistance in  order  for  them  become  compliant with all  EHS requirements defined, and to bring potential risks under control.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to enable these sites to rapidly achieve  the  performance  level  expected  by  the  Group. It comprises:\n\n- 1. a regulatory compliance  audit  carried out by an independent third party within six months of the acquisition;\n- 2. deployment  of  the  EHS  processes  described  above (EHS  manual,  EHS  reporting,  training,  audit  programme); and\n- 3. monitoring of the integration within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Managing risks and controlling the impact of sites on their environment\n\nThe  Group  systematically  analyses  the  industrial  risks  of  its activities,  specifically  their  environmental  impact  on  the  soils, water or air of the places where they are performed.\n\n## Analysing in order to manage and limit risks\n\nEach site has a general environmental analysis to be updated on a regular basis and whenever a significant change occurs.\n\nAll employee activities (permanent or temporary) are covered by an environmental analysis (1) .  To avoid all forms of pollution (soil,  surface  water,  groundwater,  air  etc.),  sites  must  comply with  the preventive  measures  described  in  the  internal procedures .  There are also contingency plans in the event of accidents for which  the  relevant  persons  are  trained. Prevention  inspections  by  insurers  and  periodic  EHS  audits verify that these measures are properly implemented.\n\nDepending  on  the  site,  if  significant  risks  are  identified  or  if L'Or\u00e9al's standards or regulations impose specific requirements, a more detailed evaluation is carried out for the activities concerned. Appropriate, and sometimes immediate, action  plans  are  implemented  to  reduce  significant  risks  to an acceptable level.\n\nA risk assessment and action plans aim to reduce the potential impacts of:\n\n- \u25cf any establishment or renovation of a site;\n- \u25cf any  introduction  of  new  equipment  or  manufacturing processes; and\n- \u25cf any changes in industrial processes.\n\nWhen  purchasing  land  or  buildings,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts  due diligence,  which  includes,  in  particular,  a  review  of  the environmental aspects.\n\n## Biodiversity and land use\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  biodiversity  and  land  use  commitments  are  based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 establishing  ecological  inventories  for  sites that  aim, through the resulting action plan, to preserve, restore and develop the biodiversity of sites in their ecosystems. A local expert conducts this inventory, which may be based on the SITES  v2  standards  (Reference  Guide  for  Sustainable  Land Design and Development), aligned with the LEED environmental  certification  (Leadership  in  Energy  and Environmental Design);\n- \u00b7 reducing the impact of any construction on the environment: This  could  involve,  for  example,  choosing a  zone  that  is  already  industrially  developed,  an  existing industrial  site  or  a  brownfield  site.  For  administrative  sites, this could be an urban area with a high population density close  to  a  residential  neighbourhood,  ideally  located  in the city centre or in a neighbourhood well served by public transport. A sustainable building site charter includes these recommendations and requires selective sorting of building site  waste  and  minimised  impact  on  residents  during  the project phase;\n- \u00b7 if possible,  place  the  site  on  land  located  more  than 30 metres from any wetland (sea, ponds, lakes, rivers etc.), outside  natural  areas,  public  green  spaces,  land  with endangered  or  threatened  species,  or  any  other  unbuilt areas (farmland etc.);\n\n- \u00b7 prevent  soil  erosion resulting  from  wind  and/or  rainwater runoff  during  construction,  including  by  protecting  the stored arable soil layer to enable it to be reused;\n- \u00b7 maintain or restore native natural habitats and  biodiversity on the built site;\n- \u00b7 maximise green or natural spaces on the site (even beyond local  legal  requirements),  and  minimise  impermeable surfaces;\n- \u00b7 focus  on  cleaning  up  polluted  sites  (e.g.  brownfield  sites) where development is more difficult due to environmental contamination (real contamination or contamination perceived  as  such).  This  allows  construction  on  natural  or non-artificial land to be avoided; and\n- \u00b7 for  future  administrative  sites,  lease  buildings  that  are certified  LEED  Gold  or  Platinum  (or  equivalent)  in  mature real estate markets.\n\n## Surface water\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted rainwater standards  in  order  to monitor its quality and avoid its pollution . For instance, sites are equipped  with  oil  separators  for  parking  areas.  Similarly, adequate retention capacities must be implemented for any retention and operating area where accidental spills are liable to occur. This retention capacity  must  allow  for  fire extinguishing water to be kept at each site.\n\n## Industrial wastewater\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  31  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  had  their  own wastewater treatment  plant .  These  plants  use  a  range  of technologies,  including  physical,  chemical  and  biological processes, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater  and  local  discharge  conditions.  In  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al continued  to  install  wastewater  treatment  plants  for  its wastewater, particularly in France.\n\nThe  sites  are  responsible  for  equipment  operation  and wastewater  management,  which  are  subject  to  specific procedures and instructions. At least once a year, an internal audit  or  self-assessment  of  the  corresponding  facility  is organised and documented.\n\n- A self-monitoring system representative of wastewater discharges  is  in  place  in  each  factory.  It  serves  to  monitor regulated  and  contractual  parameters  such  as  chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), pH, the temperature of wastewater and substances that could disturb  the  operation  of  an  internal  or  external  wastewater management facility. This self-monitoring is a tool for detecting the risk of overshooting, which helps anticipate any non-conformities and initiate corrective actions.\n\nIn  2022,  the  total  COD  of  wastewater  leaving  the  Group's factories was 0.34 g \u2611 per finished product, a decrease of 41% in absolute terms and of 44% per finished product compared to 2019, and of 71% and 80%, respectively, compared to 2005. These  reductions  are  related  to  the  operational  start-ups of  new  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  the  optimisation of existing treatment plants at several Group factories.",

If  local  regulations  impose  a  lower  threshold,  the  site  must comply  with  the  lower  value.  At  year-end  2022,  24  factories were in compliance with this internal standard \u2611 ,  representing 63% of the Group's factories.\n\n| Scope: production sites                    | 2021    | 2022         |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Accidental spills  (number of instances)   | 0       | 0            |\n| Wastewater at the exit of the site  (m 3 ) | 911,208 | 1,020,362  \u2611 |\n| COD at the exit of the site ( in tonnes )  | 2,022   | 2,218  \u2611     |\n\n## The Group's air emissions, excluding greenhouse gases\n\nIn  addition to greenhouse gases, L'Or\u00e9al works continually to control  its  atmospheric  emissions.  Every  month,  the  Group's sites  collect  data  in  order  to  calculate  the  quantity  of  SO2 emitted  into  the  atmosphere.  In  addition,  each  factory updates  the  mapping  and  inventory  of  volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during its operations annually. The operation and maintenance of atmospheric emission collection  and  treatment  facilities  are  subject  to  specific procedures and instructions.\n\n## Aligning greenhouse gas emissions with the GHG Protocol\n\nThe  Group  calculates  and  monitors  the greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions  linked  to  all  its  activities  in  accordance with  the  GHG  Protocol.  These  emissions  are  defined  as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Scope  1  emissions:  direct  GHG  emissions  linked  to  the consumption of gas and fuel oil at all sites operated by the  Group:  factories,  distribution  centres,  administrative sites  and  research  centres.  This  includes  GHG  emissions associated with potential cooling gas leaks;\n- \u25cf Scope  2  emissions:  indirect  GHG  emissions  linked  to electricity, heating, cooling and steam purchased at all sites operated  by  the  Group:  factories,  distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres; and\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe quantity of VOCs emitted by the Group's factories in 2021 totalled 156 tonnes.\n\nThe  quantity  of  SO2  emitted  by  all  the  sites  operated  by  the Group  totalled  0.3  tonnes  in  2021  and  0.1  tonnes  in  2022, representing a reduction of 53%.\n\n## Noise pollution\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's industrial activities are not particularly noisy. The sites comply  with  the  noise  standards  to  which  they  are  subject. Internal environmental reporting is one way in which to ensure monthly readings of any non-conformity on this issue.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risks\n\nThe  amount  of  the  provisions  for  environmental  risks  is  not material  (see  note  13.1  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\n## 4.3.1.1.3. Fighting climate change on operated sites\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  a  major  objective  of  fighting  climate change  in  the  overall  exercise  of  its  activity.  Every  effort  is being made to achieve this objective, especially at the sites where its activities are performed.\n\n## A/ Reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n\nCompared to other industries, the cosmetics industry has lower energy consumptions and lower CO2 emissions.

This includes  all  industrial  and  administrative  sites,  as  well  as research  centres.  However,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to the efforts to fight climate change for many years and applies a proactive policy for the reduction of its CO2 emissions.\n\n- \u25cf Scope  3  emissions:  other  indirect  GHG  emissions  linked in  particular  to  the  product  supply  chain  (upstream emissions)  and  the  use  of  products  and  services  during their life cycle (1) (downstream emissions).\n\nUnder  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group aims  to  reduce  the CO2 emissions  of  its  operated  sites (Scopes 1 and 2) by 100% by the year 2025.\n\nWith  a  view  to  limiting  its  impact  on  climate  change  and achieving  this  target,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a  strategy based on three pillars:\n\n- \u25cf Reducing its energy needs by implementing energy sobriety approaches  and  by  improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  its facilities (buildings, equipment, industrial processes, etc.);\n- \u25cf Increasing the use of local renewable energy wherever possible;\n- \u25cf Achieving  the  targets  defined  for  the  sites  without recourse to carbon offsetting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These efforts focus primarily on two areas: the continuous improvement of industrial processes and  the  performance  of  associated  equipment; and the optimisation of energy consumption in buildings. In this respect,  any  new  Group  building  has  to  comply  with  the strictest environmental standards.\n\nFurthermore, following the French government's announcement  of  the  ' Energy  Sobriety  Plan '  in  June  2022, the  Group  has  committed  to  reducing  energy  consumption\n\n## At industrial sites\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme aims to reduce energy consumption  in  factories  and  distribution  centres  by  40% per  thousand  units  of  finished  product  by  2030  compared with 2019.\n\nIn 2022, the total energy consumption of the industrial sites was 781,465 megawatt-hours \u2611 . This was a 4% increase in absolute value compared with 2019.\n\nIn  2022,  consumption  in  kilowatt-hours  per  finished  product decreased by 1% compared with 2019 and by 37% compared with 2005.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in kilowatt-hours per 1,000 finished products)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nin  France  and  Europe  by  10%  compared  with  2021  over  the next two years.\n\nThis commitment is in part based on :\n\n- \u25cf continuing  to  reduce  the  energy  consumption  at  sites operated    by  the  Group,  all  energy  uses  combined (heating,  air  conditioning,  compressed  air,  ventilation, lighting, etc.);\n- \u25cf reducing  the  heating  temperature  of  working  spaces  to 19\u00b0C during winter time;\n- \u25cf turning off lights, window display lighting, store screens and signage at closing time;\n- \u25cf launching a global campaign at all sites operated by the Group to reduce the energy footprint of digital technologies; and\n- \u25cf signing RTE's EcoWatt charter in France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal energy consumption of industrial sites in kilowatt-hours\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2020 2021 2019 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn millions of kilowatt-hours\n\nin kilowatt-hours per 1,000 finished products\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance with regard to this indicator. \u2611\n\n<!-- image -->",

The total  energy  consumption at the administrative sites  and research centres was 354 kilowatt-hours per 100 hours worked, a  34%  increase  compared  with  2019  (-34%  compared with 2021).\n\nChanges  in  energy  consumption  intensity  (in  relation  to  the number  of  hours  worked  on  site)  have  been  significantly affected by changes in work organisation. Indeed, since the lockdown  periods  (still  in  place  in  China  for  several  months of  2022),  the  on-site  attendance  rate  has  fallen  sharply  due to  the  extensive  use  of  remote  working.  Moreover,  industrial pilot,  laboratory and pre-launch testing (1) activities,  which are more related to research and development projects and new product launches, consume a lot of energy regardless of the number of employees present.

Preserving water resources on operated sites\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Group aspires to preserve water resources throughout its  value  chain,  especially  on  each  site  operated.  The  action plans  implemented  around  the  world  are  based  notably on the following key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 mapping  the  volumes  of  water  used ,  particularly  by  the Group's factories,  using  a  L'Or\u00e9al  internal  tool  that  carries out a comprehensive analysis of the various uses of water on a site: the Waterscan tool. Each type of use is quantified and compared with a benchmark value in order to identify potential reductions;\n\n## The 'Waterloop Factory' concept\n\nThe Waterloop Factory concept consists of using city mains water only for human consumption and for the production of the high-quality water used as a raw material for product processing.  This  means  that  the  water  required  by  the utilities (cleaning  equipment,  steam  production,  etc.) is  derived  from water  that  is  reused  or  recycled  in  a  loop on the site .\n\nIt involves the implementation of a two-step system:\n\n- \u00b7 the  optimisation  of  industrial  processes  in  order  to minimise water used which leads to a reduction of water withdrawals; and\n\n## Water withdrawal at industrial sites\n\nAs  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group has  set  itself  the  target  for  2030  of  reducing  the  water withdrawal  at  factories  and  distribution  centres  per  unit  of finished product by 30% compared with 2019.\n\nTotal  water  withdrawal  at  the  industrial  sites  came  to 2,152 thousand m 3 \u2611 in  2022,  down  1%  compared with 2019, while the production of finished products increased by 5% over the same period. Water withdrawal was 0.33 litres per finished product in  2022 \u2611 ,  representing  a  decrease  of  6%  from  2019 (and a decrease of 1% from 2021).\n\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  reduction  equipment  and  processes. This particularly concerns the cleaning phase of production equipment  and  factory  filling  and  packing  lines,  following the  OPTICIP  (OPTImisation  Cleaning  In  Place)  approach developed by L'Or\u00e9al; and\n- \u00b7 the  reuse  of  untreated  industrial  water for  a  new  purpose and recycling of the water used, after a specific additional treatment step.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  16  Group  factories  had  these  recycling facilities and were able to reuse water in industrial processes.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  has  set  the  following objective  for  2030:  100%  of  the  water  used  in  industrial processes  will  be  recycled  and  reused  in  a  loop, i.e. 100% of factories will be Waterloop factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance with regard to this indicator.\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  a  water  recycling  system:  industrial wastewater  undergoes  pre-treatment  in  the  on-site treatment  plant.  It  is  then  reprocessed  using  various technologies (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, etc.) in order to extract very high-quality water. This water is then used in a loop to clean production tools, and for utilities  as  a  replacement  for  municipal  water.  As  such, water requirements for utilities are fully covered.\n\nThe  Waterloop  Factory  concept  was  adopted  for  the  first time  in  2017  by  the  Burgos  factory  in  Spain.  In  2022,  this concept  was  also  extended  to  the  factories  in  Settimo in Italy, Vorsino in Russia, Libramont in Belgium and Yichang in China. It will gradually be deployed to all Group factories according to a priorization based on the local water stress situation.\n\n-54%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n(in litres per finished product)\n\nTarget\n\n2030\n\n%\n\n-30\n\n2005",

Water  withdrawal  was  653  litres  per 100  hours  worked  in  2022,  representing  an  increase  of  14% compared with 2019 (-18% compared with 2021).\n\nChanges  in  water  withdrawal  intensity  (in  relation  to  the number  of  hours  worked  on  site)  have  been  significantly affected  by  changes  in  work  organisation.  Indeed,  since the lockdown periods (still in place in China for several months of 2022), the on-site attendance rate has fallen sharply due to the extensive use of remote working.\n\nHowever,  while  domestic  consumption  is  proportional  to  the presence of employees on site, this is not the case for all water uses.  For  example,  industrial  pilot,  laboratory  and  pre-launch testing  activities,  which  are  more  related  to  research  and development  projects  and  new  product  launches,  consume a lot of water regardless of the number of employees present. A minimum amount of water withdrawal is also required for the maintenance and cleaning of technical facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2019\n\n2022\n\n(in litres per 100 hours worked)\n\nTargzt\n\n2030\n\n%\n\n-30\n\n## Water consumption and quantitative water footprint of production sites\n\nIn  2021,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  local  aspect  of water-related  issues,  the  Group  created  a  new  indicator: the  quantitative  water  footprint.  It  is  calculated  based  on the  water  consumption  of  a  site  (the  difference  between the  water  withdrawal  and  the  wastewater  at  the  exit)  and the level of water stress in the watershed in which it is located.\n\nThe  quantitative  water  footprint  is  only  calculated  for  the factories,  as  these  are  the  sites  that  account  for  the  majority of the Group's water withdrawal (84% of the water withdrawal for all the sites operated by the Group in 2022).\n\nAt the end of 2022, 13 of the Group's 38 factories (34%) were located in watersheds subject to water stress.\n\n| Water consumption and quantitative water footprint of the Group's factories   | 2021      | 2022         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Municipal water withdrawn (or other supplier) (m 3 )                          | 1,718,987 | 1,811,979    |\n| Rainwater (m 3 )                                                              | 92        | 0            |\n| Water withdrawn from groundwater (m 3 )                                       | 256,003   | 256,370      |\n| Total withdrawal (m 3 )                                                       | 1,975,082 | 2,068,608 \u2611  |\n| Wastewater at the exit of the site (m 3 )                                     | 911,208   | 1,020,362  \u2611 |\n| Water consumption (m 3 )                                                      | 1,063,874 | 1,048,245    |\n| Quantitative water footprint (m 3  eq.)                                       | 8,474,577 | 8,583,556 \u2611  |\n\n## The Water Disclosure Project: for transparency in information about water and water risk management across the value chain\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  taken  part  in  the Water  Disclosure Project , of  which  it  is  one  of  the  Founding  Responders. This  programme  is  aimed  at  encouraging  companies  to publish  every  year  their  water  management  strategy, their results and the projects they have launched to improve their  performances  and  to  reduce  the  risks  with  regard  to their  activities  related  to  water  usage.  The  programme  was\n\nlaunched  by  the  CDP,  a  not-for-profit  and  independent organisation.  It  promotes  transparency  and  environmental information  reporting  on  several  issues:  climate  change, water, deforestation, etc.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al was recognised for the seventh consecutive  year  as  one  of  the world  leaders  for  its strategy  and  actions  in  sustainable  water  management . It received an 'A' rating, which is the highest possible level of performance in the CDP ranking. These initiatives cover its entire value chain, from the production of raw materials to the use of products by consumers and the end of life of products.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  also  working  with  its  supply  chain  on  sustainable water management (see section 4.3.1.2.2.).\n\n+14%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Protecting biodiversity on operated sites\n\nThe  Group  wishes  to  limit  the  impact  of  its  activity  on biodiversity  throughout  its  value  chain  and  at  each  site  it operates. Biodiversity protection initiatives and awareness-raising activities  for  employees  and  local  stakeholders  have  been running for several years at many sites.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  rules  governing  land  use  when  constructing  new buildings  (see  section  4.3.1.1.2.).  In  addition  to  these,  since 2018,  each  site  with  green  or  non-artificial  spaces  has  been asked  to  implement  an  appropriate  structure  to  roll  out  a specific biodiversity roadmap. Partnerships with local external organisations (associations, specialist firms etc.) are established to  carry  out  on-site  biodiversity  inventories  and  propose appropriate action plans.\n\nThese  inventories  take  into  account  local,  regional  and national challenges, and  consider  the  proportion  and connection  of  green  spaces,  the  diversity  of  habitats  and vegetation  layers,  the  number  of  species  (flora  and  fauna), including  protected,  endangered,  and  invasive  species. The inventories help to establish a basis of scientific knowledge in order to define targeted  biodiversity action plans, conducted with associations or local experts, in  line  with  the ecosystem in which the sites operate .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the end of 2022, sites had carried out a biodiversity inventory, 71% of them are industrial sites.\n\n94\n\nTo  advance  this  theme  further,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme aims to ensure that all buildings and industrial sites operated by the Group have a positive impact on biodiversity by 2030 compared with 2019.\n\nA methodology for monitoring this commitment was developed in  2021  and  rolled  out  to  all  of  the  Group's  sites  in  2022. The status 'biodiversity net positive' is granted based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the achievement of a target for the improvement of habitat and  biodiversity  quality .  At  site  level,  this  improvement  is measured  using  an  indicator  called  the  Site  Biodiversity Score (SBS). The information required to calculate it is taken from  biodiversity  inventories.  This  indicator  assesses  and monitors  the  quality  of  biodiversity  on  a  given  site.  Sites without green or non-artificial spaces must engage in offsite projects,  whose  evolution  in  terms  of  biodiversity  quality  is integrated into the calculation of the SBS of the site; and\n- \u00b7 the  achievement  of  a  biodiversity  culture  threshold .  The development  of  a  biodiversity  culture  involves  raising awareness  among  and  training  all  teams  at  a  site, incorporating  biodiversity  considerations  into  the  rollout of  new  projects  (extending  a  building  etc.)  and  into  the everyday life of the site (responsible purchasing, awareness of food waste etc.).\n\nIn  addition,  phytosanitary  products  (insecticides,  fungicides and herbicides) used in the maintenance of green spaces can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. L'Or\u00e9al  therefore  wishes  to  end  their  use,  and  the  sites operated by the Group must report on whether or not these products are being used.\n\nThe  Group  commits  to  ensuring  that  phytosanitary  products are not used in the maintenance of outdoor green spaces on any  of  the  sites  it  operates  by  2030.  At  the  end  of  2022, 152  sites,  i.e.  90%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  sites,  maintained  their  outdoor green spaces without the use of phytosanitary products.\n\n## 4.3.1.1.6. Preserving resources and reducing waste on operated sites\n\nFor  several  years,  there  has  been  an  ambitious  approach to  waste  reduction  and  recovery  in  the  Group  within  the framework  of  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme. The L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme is continuing this work. This  is  an  ambitious  challenge,  in  light  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  exacting definition  of  waste.  Indeed,  any  substance,  product  or material leaving a site that is not a finished product intended for consumption is considered as waste, regardless of how it is treated.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  sets  a  target  for  2030 of preserving natural resources: 100% of the waste generated on the operated sites will be reused or recycled.\n\nFurthermore, building on the Sharing Beauty  With  All programme, the Group has set targets for reducing the waste generated by its sites by 2030:\n\n- \u25cf reducing the waste generation of factories and distribution centres  by  30%  per  finished  product,  compared  to  2019; and\n- \u25cf reducing  the  waste  generation  of  administrative  sites  and research centres by 30% per 100 hours worked, compared to 2019.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  also  set  itself  the  goal  of  achieving  'zero  waste to landfill' (outside of regulatory constraints).\n\n## Reducing waste generation at source\n\nThe reduction of waste generation is something that involves the Group's entire value chain , and is enabled in particular by:\n\n- \u00b7 eco-designing  products , packaging  components  and transport  packaging  in  a  way  that  aims  to  reduce  waste and improve their recyclability (weight reductions, optimisation, reuse etc.);\n- \u00b7 mapping  the  waste  generated using,  in  particular  for  the Group's industrial sites,  an  internal  L'Or\u00e9al  tool  that  carries out a comprehensive analysis of the different types of waste on  site:  the  WasteScan  tool.  Each  type  of  waste  is quantified and compared with a benchmark value in order to identify potential reductions and to prioritise the actions to be taken.",

They  aim  to  reduce product obsolescence and improve flows via the establishment  of  outlets,  sales  to  employees'  friends  and family, sales to staff and  donations  to  not-for-profit organisations.\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted  the  best  practices  in  its  restaurants under direct management. It raises employees' awareness of waste,  ensures  100%  of  food  waste  is  recovered  and  adapts the  quantities  served  accordingly.  It  promotes  responsible, fair trade and sustainable food by favouring local organically farmed  produce,  fair  trade  coffee,  and  seasonal  fruit  and vegetables.  Campuses  in  the  Paris  region  have  committed to reducing plastic and recovering frying oils by turning them into  biofuel.  Two  campuses  have  earned  the  'Mon  restau responsable'  label  for  a  quality  food  service  that  respects the environment.\n\n## Generation of transportable waste from industrial sites\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in grams per finished product, excluding sludge and returnable packaging in rotation, including returnable packaging at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2022,  83,199  tonnes  of  waste  were  generated  at  industrial sites (excluding sludge) \u2611 , an increase of 2% compared to 2019. Over  the  same  period,  the  production  of  finished  products increased  by  5%.  This  represents  12.9  grams  per  finished products representing a 3 % decrease compared with 2019 (-2% compared with 2021).\n\n## Generation of transportable waste from administrative sites and research centres\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(kilograms per 100 hours worked, excluding sludge and returnable packaging in rotation, including returnable packaging at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste  generation  for  the  administrative  sites  and  research centres was  5,073  tonnes  in  2022  (excluding  sludge), representing a 21% decrease compared with 2019. This represents 11.0 kilograms per 100 hours worked, an increase of 23% compared with 2019 (-25% compared with 2021).\n\nChanges  in  waste  generation  intensity  (in  relation  to  the number  of  hours  worked  on  site)  have  been  significantly affected by changes in work organisation. Indeed, since the lockdown  periods  (still  in  place  in  China  for  several  months of  2022),  the  on-site  attendance  rate  has  fallen  sharply  due to the extensive use of remote working.\n\nMoreover,  industrial  pilot,  laboratory  and  pre-launch  testing activities, which are more related to research and development projects  and  new  product  launches,  generate waste regardless of the number of employees present.\n\n## Tracking of transportable waste\n\nIn  addition  to  tracking  of  waste  by  type,  an  approach  to account for waste by cause has been used since 2019 at all the  Group's  factories  and  distribution  centres.  This  method identifies  and  quantifies  the  sources  and  causes  of  waste generation  in  the  flows  of  a  site.  This  approach  strengthens the action plans to reduce waste and is an additional vector of progress for the sites.\n\nAt  each  Group  site,  specific  tracking  (volumetry,  collection streams,  treatments  etc.)  of  hazardous  waste  under  local regulations  (flammable,  toxic  etc.)  is  implemented.  This tracking  takes  into  consideration  the  specific  characteristics of each country in which the sites operate. As with all waste, hazardous  waste  benefits  from  a  continuous  improvement approach.\n\n| Hazardous waste  (tonnes)                 | 2020   | 2021   | 2022      | Variation vs. 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n| L'Or\u00e9al Group                             | 17,812 | 19,875 | 23,822    | +20%                 |\n| Industrial sites                          | 17,359 | 19,260 | 23,308  \u2611 | +21%                 |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | 453    | 615    | 514       | -16%                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Into  this  are  incorporated  both reduction  at  source  and  research  into  the  best  solutions for recovering the waste it produces.\n\nSince  2020,  collaborations  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  waste treatment  companies  have  resulted  in  the  development  of recycling solutions for unmarketable finished products that are unsuitable  for  donation.  In  2020,  a  study  began  with  the L'Or\u00e9al  Research  Laboratories  to  find  material  recovery alternatives for the sludge coming  from  the  Group's wastewater treatment plants. Thanks to this work, in 2022 the Group was able to implement a specific procedure dedicated to resolving the issue.\n\nIn  2022,  96%  of  the  waste  generated  by  industrial  sites  was recovered through reuse, recycling or energy recovery \u2611 . In 2022, 20 factories and 24 distribution centres had a recovery rate of 100%.\n\n94%  of  the  waste  generated  by  administrative  sites  and research centres was recovered in 2022. In 2022, 41 administrative sites and 5 research centres had a recovery rate of 100%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator.\n\n61% of waste from industrial sites was recovered through reuse or  recycling  to  preserve  the  material \u2611 ,  3  points  more  than in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n52%  of  waste  from  administrative  sites  and  research  centres was  recovered  through  reuse  or  recycling  to  preserve the material, 3 points more than in 2019 (1 point more than in 2016).\n\n## 'Zero waste to landfill' objective\n\nL'Or\u00e9al aims to achieve a target of ' zero waste to landfill ' by the end of 2030 for all sites (outside of regulatory constraints). The  Group  works  with  specialist  companies  and  local authorities  to  implement  appropriate  treatment  solutions. The Group's factories and distribution centres rallied together to ensure this objective was achieved for the fifth consecutive year.",

Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation\n\nAbove  and  beyond  its  strict  requirements  for  its  own  sites, L'Or\u00e9al  has  for  a  number  of  years  applied  an environmental policy  to  its  entire  value  chain .  L'Or\u00e9al  works  in  partnership with  its  suppliers  to  improve  the  environmental  and  social profile  of  its  products  via  the  eco-design  and  sustainable sourcing of packaging, ingredients, formulas and their method of  transportation.  This  worldwide  ecosystem  covers  all  the Group's needs for packaging, raw materials, subcontracting, production  equipment,  promotional  and  advertising  articles etc. The commitment and performance of this ecosystem are crucial to the Group's fulfilment of its objectives.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  runs  numerous  global  webinars  (Spread  the  green vibes).  These  enable  the  Group  to  share  its  commitment  to decarbonisation,  outline  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  to  a  wider audience and announce different actions. In 2022, more than 1,833 suppliers participated in these interactive exchanges.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.1. Due diligence: selection and assessment of strategic suppliers\n\n## A/ Assessing suppliers according to their environmental and social performance\n\nThe Group has decided to use the environmental and social performance  of  its  partners  and  suppliers  as  a  primary selection  criterion.  The  commitments  under  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for the  Future  programme  fit  in  with  and  follow  on  from  those in  the  Group's  responsible  purchasing  policy  initiated  in  2002 with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care programme.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al published a new sustainable sourcing strategy focused on four pillars:\n\n- \u25cf the protection of Human Rights;\n- \u25cf the preservation of the environment and resources;\n- \u25cf the integrity of business relationships; and\n- \u25cf diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThis strategy includes commitments, objectives and monitoring tools for each pillar. The values and standards are shared with suppliers. Meanwhile the objectives are based on collaboration with external experts using recognised benchmarks.  This  common  framework  integrates  these  issues into  the  heart  of  the  business  model  in  order  to  achieve sustainable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al purchasing teams have defined five performance pillars  for  assessing  and  selecting  suppliers:  quality,  social and  environmental  responsibility,  innovation,  supply  chain and service, and competitiveness.\n\nThese  pillars  form  the  basis  for daily  performance  and long-term  strategies . A  global  scorecard  is  used  for  all purchasing  fields.  It  makes  it  possible  to accurately  measure supplier  results,  in  particular  their  compliance  with  their corporate social responsibility  commitments ,  which  represent 20% of the final assessment.\n\nThe  CSR  strategy  and  action  plans  of  the  suppliers  are  fully integrated  into  their  relationship  with  L'Or\u00e9al.  They  are therefore  discussed  at  strategic  meetings.  The  evaluation of  suppliers  on  the  CSR  pillar  is  based,  in  particular,  on the  compliance  of  their  social  audits,  the  implementation of  Solidarity  Sourcing  projects,  and  their  results  in  the  'CDP Supply Chain' programmes for the reduction of CO2 emissions and the EcoVadis assessment. In 2022, 620 strategy meetings were held.\n\nThe  suppliers  evaluated  represent  more  than  84%  of  total direct purchases and 17% of indirect purchases.\n\nSince 2016, suppliers have been able to undertake training via the Group on an online site. This training aims to optimise their sustainable  development  policies  by  means  of  e-learning modules, videos and presentations on various  topics  such  as ethics, climate change, social audits etc. This site, which is now accessible  to  all  the  Group's  strategic  suppliers,  is  gradually being expanded to all suppliers.\n\nResearch centres also achieved the objective of 'zero waste to  landfill'  in  2022.  For  administrative  sites,  the  approach  is more recent, but has accelerated.\n\nThe achievement of this target is part of the more overarching circular economy approach the Group is engaged in. As far as possible, L'Or\u00e9al seeks to promote the local treatment of waste, in  order  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  and  to  create synergies with other local stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  letter,  reviewed  in  2021,  sets out the requirements and commitments that L'Or\u00e9al imposes on its  suppliers  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  programmes and  policies  concerning  ethics,  corporate  responsibility, human  rights,  working  conditions  and  compliance.  Now entitled  the  'Mutual Ethical Commitment Letter', it has been rolled out gradually to all suppliers worldwide (see section 3.4).\n\nThe Group's subcontractors and its suppliers of raw materials, packaging,  production  equipment  and  POS/ promotional  advertising  items  located  in  countries  identified as being at risk according to Verisk Maplecroft are subject to a mandatory  social  audit (and  prior  to  any  inclusion  on  the supplier  panel).  These  audits,  performed  by  independent service providers, aim in particular to:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  Human  Rights and labour law; and\n- \u00b7 address  employee  safety,  working  conditions  and  the impact of activities on the environment.\n\nThe  Group  finances  the  initial  audits  as  well  as  the  re-audits that take place three years later. The follow-up audits to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions are paid for by the suppliers.\n\n## Key figures\n\nSince  2019,  over  3,359  supplier  sites  have  been  audited  in accordance with the L'Or\u00e9al standard (see section 3.4.7.3.) :\n\n- 1,145 audits (1) were carried out in 2022 \u2611 , meaning more than 5,211 since 2019; \u00b7\n\n## C/ Encouraging strategic suppliers to conduct a self-assessment of their sustainable development policy\n\nIn  2014, L'Or\u00e9al launched a programme for assessing strategic suppliers (2) and  their  sustainable  development  policy.  The EcoVadis assessment is helping to refine the analysis of suppliers' performance  and  identify  areas  for  improvement  in  terms  of human  rights protection, business ethics, environmental preservation and diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n## 2022 Results\n\nIn 2022,  859  suppliers  were  subjected  to  an  EcoVadis assessment of their social, environmental and ethical policies, as  well  as  the  implementation  of  those  policies  by  their  own suppliers.  306  of  them,  representing  94%  of  the  Group's strategic suppliers, obtained an average score of 61/100.\n\nTen  areas  are  audited:  child  labour;  forced  labour;  the environment,  health  and  safety;  compliance  with  the  laws relating to trade unions; non-discrimination; disciplinary practices; harassment or a hostile work environment; due  payment  of  remuneration  and  benefits;  working  time; and relations with subcontractors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  social  audit  is  mainly  based  on  the  internationally recognised  SA  8000  standard.  However,  the  Group  has  also imposed  more  stringent  criteria,  particularly  in  terms  of  the minimum  age  for  child  labour.  This  is  set  at  16  years  of  age for  all  employees  of  suppliers,  a  higher  age  limit  than  that required by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nA tool to manage social audits is used to plan the audits with the external service provider's system and manages the results and  action  plans  for  all  suppliers  concerned.  An  online training programme that supplements the Sourcing Discovery training  module  is  available  to  all  purchasers.  This  explains to  every  new  purchaser  the  importance  of  the  social  audit programme  and  how  purchasers  must  make  it  part  of  their daily  process.  The  Group's  purchasers  accordingly  promote the continuous improvement of their suppliers in line with the Group's standards.\n\n- \u00b7 Follow-up  audits  represent  36%  of  the  total  number  of audits  conducted  in  2022  and  allowed  63%  of  the suppliers audited to improve their results; and\n- \u00b7 99%  of  supplier  production  sites  requiring  audits  have been audited at least once.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.2. Involving strategic suppliers in the Group's ambitions\n\n## A/ Encouraging suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  involved  its  suppliers  in  the  process of  measuring  and  reducing  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions by encouraging them to participate in the CDP Supply Chain programme.  In  2022,  652  suppliers  participated  in  the  CDP Supply  Chain,  representing  80%  of  the  814  suppliers  invited. Both large industrial groups and small and medium businesses were  selected  from  all  purchasing  areas,  everywhere  in  the world. The average supplier result in 2022 was 'B-'.\n\nIn the direct purchases category, the suppliers participating in the CDP Supply Chain account for 89% of expenditure in 2022. The average mark for the direct suppliers was 'B-'.\n\nIn December 2015 at the time of COP21, L'Or\u00e9al strengthened its objectives  and  accelerated  the  implementation  of  its efforts to combat climate change. Since then, suppliers have been encouraged, via the CDP Supply Chain, to report their carbon  emissions,  set  targets  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions and communicate their action plans to achieve this.",

        "page_content": "Policies, performance indicators and results\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  the  suppliers  meeting  this  commitment represented  83%  of  the  Group's  strategic  suppliers.  The average score of these suppliers is 'B', the highest score since the start of the programme.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to be recognised by the CDP as one of the companies  most  committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions.  The  majority  of  the  Group's  suppliers  who  are partners of the CDP testifies to this fact. This engagement can be  attributed to the strong commitment  of  L'Or\u00e9al's Purchasing and Environmental teams. They send participating suppliers  their  results  with  comments  and  opportunities  for improvement.\n\nIn  2022,  the  teams  worked  with  the  CDP  to  support  the suppliers and undertook the following actions:\n\n- \u25cf organised  meetings  and  training  sessions  on  climate change;\n- \u25cf led online conferences for suppliers entering the programme\n- \u25cf offered  strategic  suppliers  individual  support  to  help  them understand  the  challenges  of  climate  change  and  to improve their reports in terms of environmental issues; and\n\n## Involving suppliers in the CDP Forest Disclosure Project\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  working  towards Zero  Deforestation (palm  and derivatives,  soy,  paper  and  cardboard).  In  this  regard, L'Or\u00e9al has participated in CDP Forest since 2012.\n\n## B/ Encouraging suppliers to use water responsibly\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group is committed  to  supporting  its  strategic  suppliers  in  managing their  water  sustainably.  This  support  is  based  on  a  twofold approach:  it  must  be  ensured  that  each  supplier  has  a\n\nsustainable water management plan. It must also be ensured that  the  supplier  takes  into  account,  in  terms  of  its  industrial water consumption and wastewater treatment, the condition of the drainage basin in which it operates.\n\n## Associating the Group's suppliers in the CDP Water Disclosure Project\n\nAs  part  of  its  sustainability  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the Water Disclosure Project as soon as it was launched in 2013.\n\n2022  marked  the  ninth  edition  of  the  Water  Disclosure Project Supply Chain. As such, L'Or\u00e9al selected 240 suppliers based on three criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 technology  or  activity  consuming  particularly  large amounts of water;\n\n## \u00b7 the size of L'Or\u00e9al's purchase volumes.\n\n198  of  them  agreed  to  take  part  in  the  programme  and received an individual summary report with comments from the  Group's  environmental  experts.  This  will  enable  them to identify their key points for progress. L'Or\u00e9al encourages its  suppliers  to  measure, report and set water consumption reduction  targets  for  each  production  site  by  deploying a water-related risk assessment and management system.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  suppliers  fulfilling  this  commitment represented  67%  of  the  expenses  incurred  on  all  selected suppliers. Their average score was B.\n\n- \u00b7 location of at least one production site in a high water stress area; and\n\n## C/ Using the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion\n\nThe objectives of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future express the conviction that  reducing  the  environmental  footprint  of  products  has  to be  accompanied  by  an  improvement  in  their  social  and societal benefit.\n\nThanks to its many industrial and administrative sites all over the world,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  strongly  involved  in  the  life  of  the  local communities.  As  a  company  committed  to  demonstrating strong  corporate  citizenship,  L'Or\u00e9al  builds  good  relations with  the  local  communities  and  strives  to  share  its  growth with them.\n\n- \u25cf continued to develop online toolboxes to improve supplier understanding of these issues.\n\nThe  CDP  Supply  Chain  assessment  is  at  the  heart  of  the discussions during annual  strategic meetings, but also throughout  the  year,  in  the  context  of  our  interactions  with suppliers.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group is committed to supporting its strategic suppliers in reducing their greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  50%  between  2016  and  2030 (Scopes  1  and  2).  The  Group  has  defined  a  methodology, applied  from  2022,  to  engage  suppliers  based  on  their emissions contributions and  to  manage  their  emissions performance  with  them (1) .  For  each  supplier,  an  emissions reduction  plan  is  established  according  to  commitments made (for  example,  alignment  with  the  +1.5\u00b0C  trajectory  as part  of  the  Science-Based  Targets  initiative).  In  co-operation with the suppliers in question, an action plan will be drawn up and  monitored,  utilising  the  decarbonisation  drivers  that  are suited to their business, their circumstances and their maturity.\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  encouraged  its  148  main  suppliers of paper, palm oil and soy to participate in the CDP supply chain  via  its  CDP Forest programme  dedicated  to  the supply  chain.  At  the  end  of  2022,  117  of  the  selected suppliers  had  participated  in  the  programme's  third  year. Suppliers  that  created  reports  and  implemented  a  Zero Deforestation policy and related initiatives represented 53% of  expenditure  in  respect  of  all  selected  suppliers.  Their average score was B.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By 2030, Solidarity Sourcing will have helped to achieve L'Or\u00e9al's goal of  enabling  100,000  additional  people  who  are  socially or economically vulnerable to access employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 85,544 people accessed work through the Solidarity Sourcing programme, 4,406 more people than\n\nin 2020.\n\nCreated in 2010, Solidarity Sourcing is L'Or\u00e9al's global inclusive sourcing programme. It uses the Group's purchasing power to serve  social  inclusion.  L'Or\u00e9al  allocates  part  of  its  total purchasing volume to suppliers that provide employment and a sustainable income to people who are generally excluded from  the  labour  market.  In  all  regions  of  the  world  in  which L'Or\u00e9al is present, the programme supports:\n\n- \u25cf companies  that employ people from economically vulnerable  communities.  These  communities  are  identified with reference to our DE&I policy: for example, people with disabilities, senior  citizens,  people  in  exile  etc.  Local authority  guidelines  are  also  considered  where  relevant (definition of vulnerable geographic areas: e.g. rural areas, priority  urban  neighbourhoods  [QPV]  in  France)  as  well  as international  standards  such  as  Women-Owned  Businesses as defined by the WeConnect guidelines; and\n- \u25cf companies that struggle to access major international calls for tenders.\n\nBy applying fair trade principles in their sourcing strategy, the Group's  raw  materials  purchasing  teams  enable  a  positive social  impact  while  integrating  the  challenges  of  responsible agricultural practices, environmental protection and biodiversity.\n\nOne example of this is the solidarity sourcing of shea in Burkina Faso.  Since  2014,  100%  of  our  shea  volumes  have  been sourced from Burkina Faso. The Group's purchasing contracts ensure prefinancing of crops, respect for a fair price, access to  training  and  the  establishment  of  community  projects  for 25,510  women  working  together  within  groupings  of  women producers.  More  information  is  available  at  Shea  Sourcing in Burkina Faso (loreal.com).\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al is committed to the living wage (1)\n\nIn  line  with  its  commitment  to  fair  pay  for  all  employees, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to ensuring that by 2030 all employees of  its  strategic  suppliers  receive  a  living  wage  from  their employer (calculated in line with best practices). To build its\n\nIn the ongoing progress approach, significant advances were made in the shea butter project in 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 the shea nuts purchased by the Group obtained the Fair for Life fair trade certification standard, and\n- \u00b7 an  inclusive  pilot  insurance  project  was  created  with partners,  including  the  Group's  shea  butter  suppliers  and an  insurance  specialist.  This  is  a  unique,  innovative  health and  crop  loss  micro-insurance  project.  It  is  designed  to improve  the  economic  resilience  of  producers  by  offering them  financial  cover  in  the  event  of  hospitalisations or accidents related to the shea harvest.\n\nThe  following  solidarity  sourcing  initiatives  should  also  be mentioned:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Group  and  its  suppliers  share joint  commitments  to support the emancipation of women .\n- \u00b7 In 39  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  Solidarity  Sourcing projects  related  to  the  emancipation  of  women,  which represent 42,542 jobs.\n- \u00b7 In  Latin  America,  704  single  mothers  who  are  solely responsible  for  their  household  income  are  employed full-time  across  10  Group  suppliers  (Mexico,  Peru  and Colombia).\n- \u00b7 In China, L'Or\u00e9al supports 33 companies owned and run by women, which employ 1,529 people between them.\n- \u00b7 As part of its global Supplier Diversity programme:\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  supports  4,906  jobs  at  certified  suppliers  that  are majority-owned  and  -led  by  women,  minorities,  people from the LGBTQIA+ community, veterans or people with a disability.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al USA has partnered with Creator Deck, an agency certified  by  the  Women's  Business  Enterprise  National Council  (WBENC).  This  partnership  illustrates  the  unique value that diversity-focused companies bring to the Group and  how  they  are  fostering  innovation.  Its  diversified database  of  influencers  and  its  social  media  content enable  brands  such  as  Maybelline  and  NYX  to  promote a daring and inclusive vision of beauty.\n- \u00b7 In  29  countries, L'Or\u00e9al  supports  access  to  employment for 1,390 people over 50 years of age through its purchases of  packaging  production,  POS  items,  promotional  items and services.\n\nThe  Group  is  convinced  of  the  need  to  act  collectively  to transform  the  corporate  business  model  and  increase  the impact.  It  therefore  joined  the  Business  for  Inclusive  Growth (B4IG) coalition from the beginning. Housed within the OECD, this  initiative  covers  31  international  companies  that  decided to  join  forces  around  the  central  issue  of  fighting  inequalities. In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  involved  in  the  working  group  on inclusive  purchasing and living wages, the publication of the Inclusive  Sourcing  methodology  and  several  projects  with  a positive social impact within the B4IG incubator.\n\nliving wage strategy and implementation plan, L'Or\u00e9al has partnered  with  the  Fair  Wage  Network,  a  meticulous, internationally  recognised  NGO.  To  extend  this  approach to  its  strategic  suppliers,  the  Group  strives  to  establish dialogue, collaboration and common strategic frameworks with supply chain partners, but also with other companies, civil society stakeholders, governments etc.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.1.2.3. Reducing the environmental impact associated with transporting L'Or\u00e9al products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  reducing  the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the transportation  of  its  products.  The  Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme initiated the reduction of GHG emissions by 24% per unit sold per kilometre between 2011 and 2020.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  commitments,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  going  further  and has set itself  a  target  of  reducing  GHG  emissions  by  50%  per finished  product  by  2030.  The  scope  of  consolidation  covers the transportation flows of finished products  from  the production sites to the first customer delivery point. The  commitments  have  been  shared  with  the  entire  internal and  external  ecosystem.  As  such,  sustainable  transportation was  ranked  as  a  priority  and  one  of  the  major  strategic components of the Group's sustainability transformation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's sustainable transport strategy is based on five pillars. It focuses in particular on the two greatest contributors to GHG emissions associated with product transportation: air and road transport.\n\nThe five pillars of the sustainable transport strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Limit air travel and provide for specific monitoring\n\nThe  reduction  of  air  transport  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the distribution  strategy.  As  such,  it  is  included  in  the  Divisions' budget  targets  and  is  integrated  into  our  purchasing strategies; for example, by favouring local production.\n\nIn 2022, the Group transported 0.2% of its products by weight by air,  representing 42.7% of its transportation-related carbon footprint. As a result, the total carbon footprint of air transport in 2022 was reduced by 13% compared to 2021.\n\nThese results reflect a continuous decrease for three consecutive years.\n\nThis  has  been  made  possible  by  the  exemplary  work  of  our subsidiary Travel Retail APAC, for example. Through increased collaboration with its customers, it has been able to implement alternative  solutions  to  air  transport,  such  as  multimodal transport  (road-sea).  These  have  reduced  its  CO2  emissions related to air transport by 52%.\n\n## 2. The Greener Lanes programme dedicated to long-distance road transport\n\nThis  programme  implements  solutions  that  will  reduce  CO2 emissions  on  long-distance  road  flows  with  the  highest emissions. In 2022, transportation of finished products by road represented 47.6% of the Group's GHG emissions.\n\nTo  cut  these  emissions,  new  solutions  are  being  rolled  out gradually  for  all flows between  the  Group's  factories, distribution centres and customers:\n\n- \u25cf the  use  of  multimodal  transport,  for  example  river  or  rail freight, rather than road; and\n- \u25cf the utilisation of energy with a lower environmental impact, such as biogas or biofuel vehicles, to replace diesel.\n\nThe Group has therefore identified priority transport lines that require  a  change  to  an  alternative  method  of  transport, one of the main ways to reduce GHG emissions.\n\nThese priority lines have been identified according to several factors,  including:  the  distance  travelled,  the  weight  of the  finished  products  transported,  and  their  contribution  to the CO2 emissions related to road transport.\n\nBy way of example, this year, Europe launched a major call for tenders for its inbound flows, i.e. between its factories and its local  distribution  centres  in  eurozone  countries.  Its  objective was  to  select  partners  offering  solutions  that  reduce  the carbon footprint of these flows. Following this call for tenders, 54% of the transport lines in the scope under consideration will transition  to  an  alternative  solution  to  diesel  (rail,  sea,  biogas and  biofuel).  Operational  start-up  is  expected  between  the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## 3. The  GLAM  (Green  Last  Mile)  programme  designed  to implement  solutions  that  will  reduce  CO2  emissions  from urban transport\n\nThe  Group  is  also  specifically  addressing  the  environmental impact  of  urban  transport.  It  aims  to  deploy  lower-impact solutions, such as electric vehicles, cargo bikes or natural gas vehicles.\n\nFor example, the Latin America Zone has established initiatives with  electric  vehicles  in  Uruguay  and  Brazil.  The  GLAM programme,  supported  by  the  Group's  main  small  parcel carriers,  has  also  increased  the  number  of  green  deliveries in  France  (18%),  the  UK  (11%)  and  Spain  (12%).  The  Nordic countries  have  also  implemented  a  biogas  solution  for  9% of  the  volumes  sent  to  their  customers,  resulting  in  a  7.9% reduction in CO2.\n\n## 4. Performance  management,  an  important  aspect  of  the Group's strategy\n\nFor  several  years,  the  Group  has  committed  to  a  sustainable decarbonisation  policy  and  applied  robust  action  plans  that are specific to each country.\n\nDigitalisation,  a  strategic  driver,  facilitates  access  to  data. Indeed,  by  analysing  the  precise  data  associated  with  the upstream  and  downstream  transport  from  the  distribution centres of the Group's subsidiaries, the sourcing and transport teams  are  able  to  prioritise  their  actions  according  to  their impact.\n\nThis  regular  monitoring  of  action  plans  and  performance  for the different modes of transport used is crucial. It provides the Group's stakeholders with the visibility they need to implement the Group's carbon footprint reduction strategy.\n\nThe Transport Management  Systems  (TMS),  which  are operational  in  a  number  of  countries,  provide  access  to transport  operational  data  for  consolidating  and  analysing performance in a pertinent manner.\n\n## 5. Working in partnership with the stakeholders in its ecosystem: a  key  driver  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  reduction roadmap\n\nThe Group selects and assesses its suppliers and transportation partners based on their environmental and social policy. It also considers  the  actions  they  take  to  support  the  Group  in  its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  also  conducts  regular monitoring to identify new opportunities.\n\nThis  involves,  for  example,  solutions  proposed  by  our  partners to  address  a  tense  environment  in  the  maritime  transport sector. Our partners suggested the development of multimodal  transport  (rail-road-sea)  between  Europe  and North Asia (China, Korea and Hong Kong).\n\nDuring Strategic Meetings with its partners, decarbonisation of transport  and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the previously  defined  action  plans  are  routinely  discussed. Specific in-depth discussions are organised if necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit sold)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe transport of products led to 443,534 tonnes of CO2 quivalent being emitted in 2022, which represents 65,2 g/CO2 per unit sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's carbon footprint linked to the transport of finished products rose by 6,7 % between 2016 and 2022. This change is largely due to the increased use of air transport over the same period  because of  the  growth  of  the  Asian  markets  and  the increase in the Luxury Division flows to this Zone.\n\nBetween  2021 (1) and  2022,  global  consolidation  of  the  CO2 emissions  related  to  the  transport  of  finished  products  shows a reduction in CO2 emissions (-5.6 %). This is a 9.2 % decrease in  intensity  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  (gCO2/unit  sold) over  the  same  period.  In  2022,  CO2  emissions  linked  to  air transport  fell  by  13  %  compared  to  2021 (2) ,  with  a  beneficial carry-over  to  maritime  transport  modes,  the  use  and  carbon footprint of which increased by 9 %.\n\nThanks to the actions of the Supply Chain teams across the five pillars  of  the  Group's  transport  decarbonisation  strategy, CO2  emissions  per  tonne  of  goods  transported  and  per kilometre travelled decreased by 9,4 % from 2022 (3) .\n\n(1)\n\n## 4.3.1.3. Sustainable development: from use to consumption\n\nAs  part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  the  new  sustainability programme announced in June 2020, the Group is continuing its  long-standing commitments to keep its activities within the planet's limits. The new targets have been designed to ensure the sustainability of its activities and to reconcile the Group's needs with the preservation of a planet with limited resources.\n\nFor the  Group,  preserving  resources  is  a  long-standing commitment. It applies to the entire life cycle of our products, from  their  creation  to  their  use  by  consumers.  Whenever a product is designed, created or updated, its environmental and/or social profile is improved.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  activates  a  range  of  drivers  to  promote  sustainable innovation:  reduction  of  the  environmental  footprint  of  its formulas and packaging; respect of biodiversity by means of a  sustainable  and  responsible  raw  materials  sourcing  policy; and a commitment to 'Zero Deforestation'.\n\nTogether with the Management  Committees of the international brands, the packaging and development teams, the  CSR  team  and  the  laboratories  analyse  their  portfolios of formulas and their packaging. Sustainable innovation plans are defined with their drivers for each product category.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has decided to adopt an approach based  on  recent  developments  in  life  and  environmental sciences.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  therefore launched  a  Green  Sciences programme  to  drive  sustainable  innovation through  the development of raw materials based on crops and practices that are good for the soil, water and biodiversity as well as on biotechnology  and  fermentation,  'green'  extraction  and physical processes, and, lastly, green chemistry.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Research & Innovation strategy in the field of Green Sciences aims to establish numerous strategic partnerships with innovative  start-ups  in  the  biotechnology  sector,  both  in France  and  throughout  the  world.  As  such,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the French biotech specialist Microphyt are developing a strategic partnership. Against this background,  L'Or\u00e9al's venture capital fund BOLD has acquired a minority stake in Microphyt. L'Or\u00e9al  and  Microphyt  are  aiming  to  build  a  technology platform  and  combine  their  material  and  human  resources to  create  new  raw  materials  from  microalgae  biomass. This cooperation follows numerous strategic scientific partnerships  that  L'Or\u00e9al  has  formed  in  recent  months  to strengthen its pioneering Green Sciences for Beauty ecosystem. These partners include: the life  sciences  research specialist  VERILY,  the  National  Institute  for  Materials  Science (NIMS) in Japan, the Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) and the Laboratory of Organic Polymer  Chemistry  (Laboratoire  de  Chimie  des  Polym\u00e8res Organiques - LCPO) in Bordeaux.\n\nThis  proactive  policy  is  central  to  achieving  L'Or\u00e9al's  targets for  2030  as  part  of  its  sustainability  programme,  in  particular, the  target  of  ensuring  that  95%  of  its  ingredients  are  from bio-based  sources,  derived  from  abundant  minerals  or  from circular processes.\n\nFinally, through its brands and thanks to a scheme that displays the environmental and social impact of its products ( Product Impact  Labelling ),  the  Group  aims  to  engage  its  consumers and allow them to make informed choices about sustainable consumption. In 2022, 50 companies from the cosmetics sector (including  L'Or\u00e9al),  as  well  as  professional  associations, joined forces to launch the EcoBeautyScore Consortium.",

Products with an improved environmental profile\n\nA/ Reducing the environmental footprint of products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n97 % of new or updated products have an improved environmental and social profile in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) Basis of calculation representing 72% of all projects, excluding items considered to be irrelevant, such as ad hoc animation and promotion products and regulatory compliance leading to changes that are not visible to consumers.\n\nIn 1995,  L'Or\u00e9al  opened  its  first environmental  research laboratory to evaluate  and  reduce  the  environmental footprint  of  its  formulas.  Through  this  initiative,  the  Group  has developed expertise with regard to the potential impacts of its cosmetic  products  on  aquatic  environments.  Right  from  the design stage, raw materials used in the formulation of products are evaluated as part of a strict ingredient selection process. Since  2005,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  abstained  from  registering  new  raw materials  with  an  adverse  environmental  profile  (see  section 4.3.1.3.1 B and C).\n\nPackaging represents a significant  part  of  the  environmental impact  of  cosmetic  products.  Reducing  the  environmental footprint  of  packaging  is  therefore  naturally  part  of  the commitments under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme (1) . In 2007, L'Or\u00e9al launched a Packaging and Environment Policy that  incorporates  respect  for  consumers,  the  environment  and biodiversity.\n\nThe  new  programme  highlights  three  major  challenges  to improving  the  environmental  profile  of  packaging:  resource optimisation,  the  choice  of  materials  and  circularity  after product use (see section 4.3.1.3.1. C).\n\n## Measuring the environmental impact of products\n\nFor several years, L'Or\u00e9al has carried out Lice Cycle Analysis of the life cycles of its products in order to identify, evaluate and improve their environmental impact.\n\nSince 2017, SPOT (2) , based on a rigorous scientific methodology for  assessing environmental impacts, has been rolled out to all Group brands (except recent acquisitions). This tool calculates the  environmental  and  social  footprints  of  a  product  in accordance with the European Commission recommendation (3) . SPOT  is  an  important  part  of  L'Oreal's  product  launch processes,  putting  sustainable  innovation  at  the  very  heart  of product development.\n\n- 1. SPOT precisely measures environmental impacts by integrating  14  impact  factors  used  by  the  European product environmental footprint framework.\n- 2. These different impacts are standardised on the basis of the average impacts of a worlwide consumer.\n- 3. To  obtain  a  single  value  for  the  product  environmental footprint  (formula  and  packaging),  these  impacts  are aggregated  using  a  method  based  on  the  planetary boundaries (4) .\n- 4. Lastly, the footprint is compared to a benchmark in order to obtain  a  dimensionless  score  between  0  and  10,  which allows the product design teams to measure their progress.\n\nSPOT  also  includes  a  methodology  for  measuring  the  social impact  of  products.  It  was  jointly  developed  with  internal expertise  (formula,  packaging,  factory,  stakeholders)  and eleven  international  experts  in  environmental  and  social  life cycle analyses (5) .\n\n## B/ Reducing the environmental footprint of formulas\n\nAll  products  manufactured by the Group are analysed, from shampoos and haircare products to hair dyes and perfumes. This analysis enables products with the same consumer benefit to be classified according to their environmental footprint.\n\n150 product categories that provide a consumer benefit were defined  and  over  40,000  formulas  were  screened.  Then, the  performance of each category was established to allow for the eco-design of products using SPOT. The aim is to ensure that  new formulas are developed with the goal of obtaining an improved environmental profile while maintaining the same benefits for the consumer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 49% of created or renovated products had an improved environmental profile due to a new formula with a smaller environmental footprint.\n\n## Improving biodegradability through eco-design\n\nThe Group  is working to measure  and  increase  the biodegradability  of  its  formulas  and  reduce  their  water footprint  at  the  end  of  their  life  cycle.  These  two  parameters have been integrated in the SPOT product eco-design tool.\n\nAll product formulator teams  use  this tool to assess biodegradability and water footprint whenever new formulas are created.\n\nIn 2022, 100% of formulas put into production for the first time were  evaluated  and  80%  of  these  have  an  improved environmental profile.\n\nAmong the new products launched in 2022, those listed below have  formulas  with  biodegradability  levels  of  over  98% (all L'Or\u00e9al geographic Zones):\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  example, L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  updated  the  formula  for  its  Masque  Els\u00e8ve Extraordinary  Oil  Jojoba,  increasing  its  biodegradability  level from 76% to over 99%. For its part, Garnier updated the formula for  its  Ultra  Soft  Coconut  Water  Conditioner  and  increased its biodegradability level from 81% to over 99%.\n\nThe  biodegradability  of  the  raw  materials  portfolio  was  82% in 2022.\n\n## Using eco-design to reduce the impact of the product use phase\n\nInnovation reduces the impact of the consumer use phase. In the  rinse-off  cosmetics  sector,  the  main  impacts  are  the carbon and water footprints during product use.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  preserve  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water resources.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  sustainability commitments,  the  Group  wants  to  develop  innovative solutions  that  enable  consumers  to  reduce  their  greenhouse gas  emissions  and  water  consumption  associated  with  using its products.\n\n## The three pillars of the Group's strategy to meet the challenge of water consumption\n\n- \u25cf A  reduction  in  the  quantity  of  water  used  for  rinse-off products:  this  means  developing  formulations  that  offer better  rinsability.  For  example,  in  2022,  the  Garnier  brand doubled its sales of solid shampoos that offer a 20% saving in the rinse volume used.\n- \u25cf Innovation  in  routines:  the  Group  continually  adapts  its innovation  model  to  meet  all  beauty  aspirations  around the world. L'Or\u00e9al wants to enable its consumers to reduce the impact of their use phase by offering innovations in the areas  of  product  use  and  routines.  The  goal  is  to  reduce the  impact  of  the  use  phase  by,  for  example,  eliminating the rinse phase. In 2022, the Garnier brand extensively rolled\n\nout  its  Ultra  Soft  range  of  leave-in  conditioners  contained in  a  cardboard  tube  across  Europe.  This  eco-designed technology  (91%  biodegradable  and  94%  renewable ingredients) eliminates the usual need to rinse off with water as required by traditional conditioners.\n\n- \u25cf The  deployment of technologies: the Group is developing equipment  to  reduce  water  consumption  in  salons.  It  is collaborating with its ecosystem to develop new solutions. The Group has also partnered with the Swiss start-up Gjosa to optimise the rinse-off technology for shampoos, haircare products  and  hair  dyes.  Called  L'Or\u00e9al  Water  Saver,  this sustainable  haircare  technology  for  use  in  salons  was presented at the Consumer Electric Show in January 2022. It  reduces  water  flow  by  69%  and  is  currently  being  rolled out in Europe and Dubai. In 2023, a total of 23,000 units will be installed in these countries.\n\nSince  2016,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  have  been  favourably decorrelated  from  the  water  consumption  associated  with the use of the products.\n\n## Water consumption linked to the use of the products (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(water consumption per litres/kg of formulas sold)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  protocol  aims  to regulate  access  to  the  genetic  resources  of  a  given  region and to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of those resources.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nConscious  of  these  issues  well  before  the  Nagoya  Protocol came  into  force, L'Or\u00e9al's Research Department  has adopted,  since  2005,  an  approach  aimed  at  securing  its sourcing channels for the future. This approach must address the issues surrounding sustainable use of biodiversity. To do so, the  Group  gives  preference  to,  inter  alia,  renewable  raw materials (2) while ensuring that they are responsibly sourced.\n\nFor more than 10 years, green chemistry has been a catalyst for L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable innovation  policy. L'Or\u00e9al has adopted its  principles  to  promote  the  use  of  renewable  raw materials, to design raw materials serving to reduce waste and to  preserve  the  water  cycle.  In  a  broad  sense,  green chemistry aims to prevent upstream pollution and to combat the  use  and  contamination  of  the  environment  at  source. The increasing use of plant-based ingredients presents supply risks  due  to  climate  change  (availability  and  price)  and  can also result in environmental  consequences  through  the cultivation  of  the  crops  that  produce  these  ingredients (deforestation,  soil  depletion,  consequences  for  biodiversity, etc.). It is therefore necessary to take measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, among the raw materials newly referenced by the Group 82% in number were renewable and 24% in number respected green chemistry.\n\nProducts marketed in 2022 with a proportion of renewable raw materials above 98%\n\n| Product                                                      | Product type   | Brand           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| KIEHL'S CALENDULA CLEANSING FACIAL BAR                       | Face cleanser  | Kiehl's         |\n| ATELIER COLOGNE BOHEME FLEUR DE TANGER CREME MAINS ET ONGLES | Body care      | Atelier Cologne |\n| HAIR DRINK LAMELLAR PINEAPPLE                                | Haircare       | Garnier         |\n| EVERPURE SIMPLY CLEAN SHEER OIL                              | Oil            | L'Or\u00e9al Paris   |\n\nIn 2022, in addition to marketing new products with a very high proportion  of  renewable  raw  materials,  L'Or\u00e9al  updated  its formulas  that  were  already  on  the  market.  For  example, Lanc\u00f4me  updated  the  formula  for  its  GENIFIQUE  CREME BARRIERE NUIT face care product, increasing the percentage of renewable materials from 31% to 92%. Kiehl's updated the formula for its KIEHL'S CREAMY EYE TREATMENT WITH AVOCADO eye  care  product,  increasing  the  percentage  of  renewable materials  from  35%  to  93%.  La  Proven\u00e7ale  launched  a complete  certified  organic  or  natural  makeup  routine. It  includes  certified  organic  makeup  containing  up  to  100% naturally sourced ingredients, without compromising the result or the sensory experience.\n\nThe  Group  also  set  up  the  Green  Sciences  transition programme to drive  change  in  its  portfolio  of  raw  materials, with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  ingredients  have  a  favourable environmental  profile.  To  do  so,  the  programme  is  based  on production and transformation processes that respect human health and environmental ecosystems.\n\nThanks to the Green Sciences pillars, the Group can optimise the  production  and  transformation  of  raw  materials  in  the existing  portfolio,  as  well  as  those  under  development. The Sustainable Cultivation pillar will ensure biomass production while respecting best practices for agriculture and biodiversity, soil quality, use of phytosanitary products, greenhouse gas emissions and sound water management. The biomass transformation pillars correspond to biotechnology and  fermentation, green chemistry and extraction  processes.  The  Group  promotes  green  chemistry principles aimed at developing ingredients with a favourable environmental and human safety profile. These ingredients are made  from  plant  raw  materials  from  renewable  resources, minimising the number of synthesis stages, the consumption of non-ecotoxic  solvents  and  energy,  and  the  production  of by-products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This represents 665 (2) raw  materials.  During  the  same  year,  82%  of  the  newly registered raw materials were renewable. Furthermore, 13 new raw  materials  based  on  green  chemistry  principles  were registered, representing 24% of the total.\n\nThe  Group  considers  biodiversity  to  be  a  key  source  of innovation.  Plans  to  increase  the  use  of  raw  materials  from renewable sources must ensure that the ecosystems and the availability  of  these  resources  for  other  purposes  are  not adversely affected. The Group is committed to a sustainable and responsible supply chain (see section 4.3.1.2.2.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 61% of our ingredients in formulas were from biobased sources, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  part  of  its  target  for  2030,  the  Group  is  working  with specialised external partners such as BRGM to define a robust scientific methodology aimed at classifying the minerals used and ensuring that they are from abundant sources.\n\n## Respect for biodiversity and societal contribution\n\nIn 2018, as part of the Act4nature initiative, L'Or\u00e9al set a goal of  having  100%  of  its  bio-based  raw  materials  coming  from sustainable sources by 2030. To be included in this category, raw  materials  must  meet  various  requirements  in  terms  of traceability,  respect  for  Human  Rights  and  compliance  with the Nagoya Protocol.\n\n## Traceability of raw materials from sustainable sources\n\nTraceability  means  that  the  raw  materials  have  an  identified botanic and geographic origin.\n\nFurthermore,  the  traceability  campaigns  with  the  Group's suppliers  have  made  it  possible  to  trace  100%  of  plant-based ingredients to their country of production, or even as far as the biomass production site. In 2022, the portfolio of bio-based raw materials  comprised  1,704 (3) raw  materials  from  328  botanical species cultivated in more than 100 countries.\n\n## Respect  for  Human  Rights  throughout  the  entire  production chain\n\nRespect for Human Rights in accordance with ILO principles is now  expected  throughout  the  entire  production  chain  of these raw materials. In 2022, 100% of bio-based raw materials used  by  the  Group  were  reassessed,  in  particular  based  on criteria  such  as  respect  for  biodiversity  and  forced  labour (see SCAN Index below).\n\n## Compliance with the principles of the Nagoya Protocol\n\nPlants  are  sourced  in  a  way  that  promotes  the  economic development  of  the  producers  and  respect  for  traditional knowledge  associated  with  biodiversity  in  accordance  with the principles of the Nagoya Protocol.\n\nOut  of  the  328  botanical  species  that  are  the  source  of  the biosourced  raw  materials  used  by  the  Group,  around  6% (4) present significant biodiversity challenges (endangered species,  and  impact  of  production  on  natural  environments) depending  on  their  geographic  origin  and  the  method  of extraction or production used. They are the subject of specific action plans initiated with suppliers  and,  if  necessary,  benefit from  the  systematic  support  of  independent  external  third parties, in order to manage the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.\n\nThe palm oil and its by-products segment is  the  subject  of  a specific 'Zero  Deforestation'  approach (see  below).  At  the end of 2022, 100% of supplies were covered by action plans with the suppliers concerned.\n\nOther  segments  represent  22%  of  the  portfolio  of  bio-based raw  materials  in  volume  and  86%  in  number.  For  these segments, L'Or\u00e9al has defined sustainable sourcing challenges indicators (5) in order to assess their sustainability.\n\nThese  indicators  are  consolidated  within  the  SCAN  index (6) , which  enables  priorities  to  be  set  in  the  sustainable  sourcing action  plans.  The  Group  regularly  updates  the  information collected.  There  are  already  improvement  action  plans  in place with suppliers for 71% of the volumes (45% in number) of raw  materials  that  have  sustainable  sourcing  challenges according  to  the  SCAN  index.  These  action  plans  aim  to ensure  sustainable  sourcing  in  order  to  achieve  the  goal  of 100%  of  the  Group's  bio-based  raw  materials  coming  from sustainable sources.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has also launched a support and training programme for more  than  200  suppliers.  They  are  now  trained  in sustainable sourcing of raw materials in order to guarantee the traceability  of  the  raw  materials  delivered  to  L'Or\u00e9al  and  to ensure that the associated supply streams are secure.\n\nDepending  on  the  level  of  environmental  and/or  social  risk identified  on  these  streams,  suppliers  are  notably  asked  to deploy the field audit procedure for producers. This procedure is  based on 88 indicators defined by L'Or\u00e9al with the support of  the  Rainforest  Alliance  NGO  and  was  reviewed  in  2019 by  EcoCert,  The  Biodiversity  Consultancy  and  The  Danish Institute for Human Rights.",

        "page_content": "Suppliers  are  also  asked  to  make  use  of  sustainable  sourcing certifications adapted to their stream (Fair Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic etc.).\n\nBy  adopting  a  sustainable  sourcing  approach  for  bio-based raw materials, L'Or\u00e9al contributes to the social and economic inclusion of vulnerable population groups while respecting the environment.  In  2022,  the  proportion  of  sustainably  sourced bio-based ingredients was 92%, showing a slight decrease due to  the  ongoing  improvement  in  the  traceability  of  the bio-based  portfolio  and  the  updating  of  countries  at  risk  via the  Scan  Index  in  line  with  the  development  of  each geopolitical context.\n\n## Rice bran oil: improving resilience to climate change in Thailand\n\nL'Or\u00e9al uses rice bran oil from Thailand for its anti-dandruff and antioxidant properties (haircare and skincare products). In Thailand, rice production accounts for a total of  4  million  hectares,  representing  around  20%  of  the country's  agricultural  land.  As  the  world's  fifth  largest producer  of  rice,  Thailand  is  also  one  of  its  leading exporters.  Rice  production  is  therefore  one  of  the  main pillars  of  the  local  economy,  although  the  monoculture  of rice has a negative impact on the environment.\n\nIn  2016,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  project  for  the  responsible sourcing of rice bran from small producers in the Isan region in north-eastern Thailand. L'Or\u00e9al works with the PUR Projet NGO and its suppliers to support four producer cooperatives in implementing climate-smart practices in order to reduce the  amount  of  methane  produced  by  the  region's  rice farming  and  to  improve  its  resilience  to  climate  change. In  this  context,  four  plots  were  established  to  provide\n\n## Respecting biodiversity and measuring our impact\n\nThe loss of biodiversity undermines food security, health, quality of life and  many  services  provided  to  our  economies (pollination, the purity of air and  water,  soil fertility). It also  effects  the  Group's  resilience  to  climate  change. The  conversion  of  natural  ecosystems  for  agricultural  and urban development purposes is recognised by science as the primary factor for the loss of biodiversity, followed by pollution, climate change and the introduction of invasive species.\n\nThe Group  has  a  long-standing commitment  to  the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The L'Or\u00e9al for the  Future  programme  reaffirms  this  commitment  by  placing biodiversity right at the heart of its goals.\n\nThe  Group  has  worked  with  The  Biodiversity  Consultancy  to develop an innovative way of measuring the impact that its industrial activities and sourcing have on natural ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 92% \u2611 of the biobased ingredients in our formulas were traced and sourced from sustainable sources (1) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) For the definition of the scope see the Methodological Notes.\n\n\u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator.\n\nfull-scale  demonstrations  of  agricultural  techniques.  The practices presented in the demonstration plots include:\n\n- \u25cf the  cessation  of  ploughing  to  preserve  the  different  soil horizons and maintain their capacity to sustainably retain water;\n- \u25cf agroforestry  on  the  edge  of  rice  fields  to  encourage the  diversification  of  farmers'  incomes  and  improve the surrounding biodiversity;\n- \u25cf the adoption of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) to reduce  the  use  of  water  and  limit  methane  emissions; and\n- \u25cf the smart use of water to improve adaptation to droughts.\n\nThanks  to  the  determination  of  volunteer  farmers,  the project  has  successfully  demonstrated  the  benefits  of regenerative  agriculture  to  the  agricultural  community, in  particular how carbon sequestration and the protection of biodiversity can significantly increase yields and improve their livelihoods.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al strongly encourages as many farmers as possible to adopt  SRI  practices.  In  2022,  1,186  local  producers benefited from the project, 59% of which were women.\n\nThis  new  indicator  is  based  on  three  parameters:  the  ground surface  required,  the  loss  of  biodiversity  related  to  Group practices and the significance of biodiversity in the ecosystem concerned. It estimates that sourcing plant-based ingredients accounted for more than 80% of our biodiversity footprint.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is therefore committed to ensuring that, between now and 2030, its footprint on the ecosystems required to produce its  plant-based  ingredients  remains  unchanged  from  2019 levels.  The  following  drivers  have  been  identified  as  key  to achieving this goal:\n\n- \u25cf the  adoption  of  regenerative  agricultural  practices  by suppliers,  in  order  to  improve  yields,  preserve  biodiversity and  help  farmers  transition  towards  more  sustainable agriculture;\n- \u25cf the  implementation  of  an  ambitious  plan  to  develop alternatives  to  the  raw  materials  with  the  highest  impact, particularly  through  biotechnology  and  circular  processes, as part of the Green Sciences programme; and\n- \u25cf support for  rehabilitation  projects  for  ecosystems  adjacent to our strategic supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, the Group takes part in the work of the Science-Based Targets for Nature  network's  Corporate  Engagement  Programme,  CDC Biodiversit\u00e9's  B4B+  club (1) and  the  One  Planet  Business  for Biodiversity (OP2B) collective.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al refined the footprint calculation methodology and  the  databases  used,  and  also  improved  its  traceability data through constant exchange with its suppliers.\n\nThanks to the quality of its traceability data, L'Or\u00e9al was able to analyse the importance of biodiversity relative to its supply areas, using the STAR metric based on IUCN data (see details in the methodological notes). This analysis shows that:\n\n- \u00b7 approximately 70% of the land use related to the sourcing of  the  Group's  bio-based  ingredients  occurs  in  countries where the risk of significant impact on biodiversity is very low or low; and\n- \u00b7 30% of bio-based ingredients come from regions where the risk  of  significant impact on biodiversity is medium, such as Indonesia  and  Malaysia  for  palm  oil  or  the  Philippines  for coconut.\n\nThese  results  will  enable  us  to  refine  the  supply  strategy  for each plant and each country, but also to work on innovative alternatives.\n\n## 'Zero Deforestation' commitment\n\nIn its 'Zero Deforestation' policy published in 2014, the Group pledged that by 2020 it would no longer include any product linked to deforestation in its ingredients or raw materials. Since 2007,  L'Or\u00e9al's  action  plans  have  promoted  a sustainable supply of agricultural raw materials that could be a cause of deforestation  (palm  oil,  soybean  extract,  fibrewood-based products, etc.).\n\nIn  2021,  aware  of  the  increasingly  critical  global  threat  to forests  and  the  social  and  environmental  consequences  of deforestation,  the  Group  renewed  its  goals  following  a consultation  with  its  stakeholders.  These  new  goals  can  be found in its 2030 Forest Policy .\n\nCapitalising  on  past  achievements  in  the  areas  of  palm, soy  and  wood  fibre,  the  2030  Forest  Policy  covers  more  raw materials,  prioritised  according  to  their  strategic  importance and the social and environmental risks identified. It is based on sustainable  and  responsible  management  throughout  the supply  chains  and  on  the  preservation  and  rehabilitation  of natural  ecosystems  adjacent  to  production  areas.  It  is therefore  incorporated  into  the  Group's  sustainable  sourcing strategy for its ingredients and sets new goals that are specific to these raw materials.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  environmental  dimension,  the  2030  Forest policy  focuses  on  Human  Rights  and  improving  the  living conditions of the communities affected.\n\n## Results for raw materials\n\nPalm: In  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  consumed  284  tonnes  of  palm  oil  and 88,156  tonnes  of  palm  oil  and  palm  kernel  derivatives.  These derivatives  come  from  the  pulp  or  the  kernel  of  palm  fruit respectively.  These  oils  are  used  to  produce  glycerine,  fatty acids  and  fatty  alcohols  which  form  part  of  the  composition of the Group's products.\n\n(2)\n\nwww.rspo.org\n\nAs  part  of  its  'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment,  L'Or\u00e9al  is rolling  out  a  specific  strategy  for  palm  oil  derivatives,  in partnership  with  all  stakeholders  (producers,  NGOs  and suppliers):\n\n- \u00b7 100%  of  purchases  of  palm  oil,  and  palm  oil  and  palm kernel  derivatives  have  been  certified  as  sustainable according to the RSPO (2) criteria since 2012; and\n- \u00b7 96%  of  the  main  derivatives  come  from  sources  that  are identified (as far as mills).\n\nPalm  -  certification :  100%  of  the  palm  oil  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al meets  the  standards  and  procedures  of  the  Roundtable  on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) according to the SG (Segregated) model, the most demanding traceability model of the RSPO. 100% of the derivatives are also certified.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al had increased the proportion of its physically certified purchases  to  99%  RSPO  Mass  Balance  by  the  end  of  2022, up from 98% in 2021 and 95% in 2020. The remainder is covered by the RSPO Book & Claim model.\n\nTo  complete  its  certification  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  made  a commitment  for  at  least  30%  of  its  volumes  to  be  physically connected  to  field  projects  that  support  small,  independent planters.  In  2022,  25.4%  of  these  volumes  were  physically connected to sustainable sourcing projects in  Indonesia  and Malaysia.\n\nPalm  -  traceability : In  2014,  within  the  framework  of  its 'Zero Deforestation' commitment ,  the Group had pledged to trace the  main  palm and palm kernel derivatives that it uses as far as the mills by the end of 2015. This was a complex task as  the  process  for  transforming  derivatives  involves  a  large number of players and many branches of the supply chains.\n\nWith  the  support  of  a  firm  of  independent  experts,  an  initial phase  involving  a  survey  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategic  suppliers  was conducted in 2014. These suppliers represented more than half of  the  volumes of palm and palm kernel derivatives supplied to  L'Or\u00e9al.  Since  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  updated and enriched its data collection by extending the scope to cover all suppliers in  order  to  be  able  to  trace  and  identify  the  origin  of  100% of its main palm and palm kernel derivatives. The results of this work show that Malaysia and Indonesia are the main countries from which supplies are obtained. It was also established that, for  2021,  98%  of  these  volumes  of  palm  and  palm  kernel derivatives could be traced back to the refineries, 96% to the mills and 48% as far as the plantations.\n\nIn  2022,  on  the  basis  of  this  work  and  with  the  goal  of transparency, for the fifth consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al published on  loreal.com  the  list  of  the  944  mills  (928  in  2021)  indirectly connected to its supply chain (over 90% of its palm derivative volumes) and the list of its direct suppliers of derivatives.\n\nPalm  -  measurement  tools :  In  2016,  L'Or\u00e9al  sought  to  round out its evaluation and selection tools for suppliers in this stream by  developing  a  specific  tool,  the  Sustainable  Palm  Index. Every year, it is used to assess the commitment, progress and achievements of direct suppliers in favour of sustainable palm oil.  It  also  evaluates  the  progress  made  towards  the  'Zero Deforestation'  objective  and  suppliers'  compliance  with  the Group's  requirements.  First  made  public  in  2016,  this  tool  is available to all players in the supply chain.",

        "page_content": "In  2018,  to  take  its  commitment  further,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  a collaboration  with  ZSL  (Zoological  Society  of  London)  and Transitions.  The  goal  was  to  develop  a  tool  to  evaluate refineries and crushers (which extract the oil from the kernels) on  the  basis  of  their  reporting,  policies  and  procedures. The  indicators  used  in  this  evaluation  were  aligned  with  the requirements of the Group's standards in respect of deforestation.  This  tool  has  been  available  and  public  since 2019.  At  mill  level,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  has  used  Global  Forest Watch's  risk  assessment  tool  since  2016  to  ensure  that  no\n\nderivative  traced  to  mills  is  linked  to  deforestation.  In  2018, the procedure for dealing with cases of non-compliance with the  'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment  by  direct  or  indirect suppliers  was  also  published.  Since  November  2019,  in  order to  contribute  to  the  sector  transformation,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been a  founding  member  of  Action  for  Sustainable  Derivatives (ASD),  an  initiative  coordinated  by  BSR  and  Transitions. The Group actively contributes to ASD, in particular by sharing all its methodologies and tools developed since 2014.\n\n## Palm Project with the Livelihoods Fund for Family Farming (L3F): integrating regenerative agriculture into palm production in Indonesia\n\nIndonesia  is  the  main  country  from  which  L'Or\u00e9al  obtains supplies of palm oil derivatives, accounting for 72.8% of the Group's purchase volumes. Sumatra, and more specifically North Sumatra, is an area that is particularly  vulnerable  to climate  change.  For  decades,  millions  of  independent smallholder  farmers  in  emerging  countries  have  relied  on palm  oil  to  make  a  living.  Today,  they  are  still  mainly excluded from the necessary industry transition to sustainability but are facing numerous challenges: competition  with  large  plantations,  declining  productivity and a lack of financial means to replace their ageing trees.\n\nIn  keeping  with  its  'learning-by-doing'  approach  as  part of  a  coalition  of  international  and  local  stakeholders,  the L3F  has  launched  an  unprecedented  project  to  help 2,500  smallholder  farmers  in  Sumatra  to  successfully  make this  transition.  The  project  aims  to  build  a  transparent, deforestation-free supply chain. To achieve this, the project adopts  an  approach  that  uses  agroforestry  models adapted  to  local  conditions  and  regenerative  agriculture practices,  with  a  focus  on  preserving  biodiversity  in  the plots.\n\nSoy: In 2022, L'Or\u00e9al consumed 309 tonnes of soybean extract and 2,098 tonnes of soybean extract derivatives. In 2022, 100% of the soybean extract originating from Latin America used by L'Or\u00e9al  was  from  certified  sources  (IP  -  Identity  Preserved Proterra)  or,  for  the  most  part,  from  a  land  project  certified RTRS, Bio and Fair For Life. This project aims to support 36 small soybean producers in Brazil and Paraguay. Derivatives mainly come from areas classed without risk of deforestation.\n\nSince  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  supported  this  project (1) ,  which  will help  to  regenerate  8,000  hectares  of  degraded  farmland and  to  restore  an  additional  3,500  hectares  of  local biodiversity in addition to the plots in surrounding productive and  protected  forests.  Project  partners  Mars  and  Danone source their palm oil from the pulp of the fruit, while L'Or\u00e9al is committed to sourcing palm kernel oil extracted from the kernel of the fruit, a by-product supplied by the smallholders from the project area.\n\nPalm oil monoculture is currently the dominant agroecosystem  in  almost  all  villages  (95%).  The  main objective  is  to  train  smallholders  in  better  practices  that enable  the  sustainable  management  of  palm  plantations and  in  regenerative  agriculture  for  the  purpose  of ecological intensification. These farmers are also supported and trained in income diversification through intercropping as well as in agroforestry, organic fertiliser production, and integrated  pest  and  disease  management  in  order  to reduce  the  use  of  synthetic  phytosanitary  products  and to encourage soil rehabilitation and the gradual replanting of trees.\n\nThe  demonstration  plots  established  by  Livelihoods  and local  partners  for  teaching  regenerative  agriculture  and agroforestry  practices  aim  to  extend  to  a  total  area  of 46 hectares, covering 13 villages.\n\nPaper/cardboard: Regarding materials used by L'Or\u00e9al for its packaging,  the  paper  used  for  product  leaflets  and  the cardboard  used  for  boxes  are  certified  as  coming  from sustainably  managed  forests  (FSC  or  PEFC  certified)  (see  the section  entitled  'Materials  vigilance  and  preservation  of resources').\n\n## Improving the environmental profile of packaging, new displays and Free-Standing stores in accordance with the Group's sustainable development principles\n\nThe environmental policy for packaging is based on three drivers (the 3Rs): Reduce, Replace, Recycle .\n\n| Reduce   | designing filling levels, packing components and finished goods that are smaller and lighter in relation to the contents,  thereby consuming fewer resources;                        |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Replace  | substituting high-impact materials with alternative materials with lower environmental footprints, such as recycled materials  and materials from natural and renewable sources; and |\n| Recycle  | making sure that the packaging can contribute to circularity by being recycled.                                                                                                      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  harnesses  these  via  a  global, systematic eco-design process for packaging, notably with the help  of  the  SPOT  measurement  tool.  The  Group's  packaging strategy fully incorporates its sustainable development commitments.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  rolls  out  new  tools  (databases, guides and procedures) to support the product development teams.\n\nSince  2018,  the  Group  has  used  a  specific  POS  programme that is based on the principles of eco-design and the circular economy. For our Free-Standing Stores, we have drawn up an eco-design  and  construction  guide  in  line  with  the  Group's sustainable  development  principles.  The  Group  shares  the guidelines and best practices for both these initiatives with its suppliers and partner distributors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 73% of created or renovated products had an improved environmental profile due to improved packaging.\n\n## Materials vigilance and preservation of resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al requires a food-grade level for all materials used in its packaging that is in contact with its products. The Group also takes a proactive approach with its suppliers in order to ensure that  packaging  does  not  contain  any  sensitive  substances. Regular audits ensure the compliance of the filling and packing components delivered, thus ensuring an uncompromised level of quality and safety for consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has pledged that it will stop the production of finished products  containing PVC .  This  commitment  has  been  kept since 1 January 2018.\n\nControlling  the  source  of  materials  used  in  packaging  is  a major  challenge  that  requires  responsible  sourcing.  For  its paper, cardboard or wooden packaging, L'Or\u00e9al has set itself the target of using materials from sustainably managed forests, exploited with respect for populations and forest ecosystems. The  Group  therefore  uses  packaging  from  forests  that  are preferably  FSC  or  PEFC  certified  (or  that  have  obtained  any other certification recognised by PEFC International) .\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  member  of  the  Forest Stewardship  Council  (FSC)  in  France.  Since  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  has been  a  member  of  Forest  Stewardship  Council  (FSC) International. The FSC label is the only one claimed on paper or cardboard packaging for the Group's products.\n\nIn  2022,  98%  of  the  paper  used  for  product  leaflets  and  99% of  the  cardboard  used  for  boxes  (secondary  packaging) were  certified  as  coming  from  sustainably  managed  forests. As part of its new 2030 Forest Policy ,  L'Or\u00e9al is stepping up its goals to go beyond certification requirements while extending its  scope  of  application  to  cover  its  primary,  secondary  and tertiary  packaging.  As  such,  in  2022,  90%  of  the  Group's primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  packaging  were  certified  as coming from sustainably managed forests.\n\nIn  an  approach  to  achieve  continuous  improvement  in traceability ,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  that,  by  2030, 100%  of  its  packaging  biomaterials  will  be  traceable  and come  from  sustainable  sources,  with  no  connection  to deforestation.  To  do  so,  the  Group  will  rely  on  the  Chain  of Custody  certification  of  its  packaging  suppliers  and  on\n\nknowledge about their supplies' countries of origin (production sites  of  the  material,  origin  of  fibres).  As  such,  in  2022,  89%  of direct suppliers of primary, secondary and tertiary packaging were Chain of Custody certified, while 98% of direct purchases of  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  packaging  made  in  2021 have been traced to their country of origin (forests).\n\n## Reducing weight and volume to optimise the resources used\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the Group reduced by 3% in intensity the quantity of packaging used for its products, compared to 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReducing the weight and volume of product packaging is an integral  part  of  the  design  stage.  It  is  also  a  major  driver for  improving  their  environmental  profile.  Every  year,  L'Or\u00e9al launches  new  initiatives  aimed  at reducing  the  quantity of materials used in packaging .\n\nA  continuous  process  is  in  place  to  reduce  the  weight  of existing products. As an illustration, two initiatives implemented in 2022 can be mentioned:\n\n- \u25cf Lanc\u00f4me updated its La Vie Est Belle perfume by reducing the bottle weights by 10% to 15%; and\n- \u25cf the  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  Inoa  hair  dye  was  updated, resulting in the  product  leaflet  being  replaced  with information printed on the inside of the box. These changes have reduced the weight of the packaging (primary and secondary) by 25%.\n\nIn  addition, in order to reduce the use of resources intended for  packaging,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  marketing  an  increasing  number  of reusable products ,  i.e.  those  that  are  reloadable  or  refillable. For example, Giorgio Armani launched its refillable fragrance Armani Code, while the Garnier brand introduced new Ultra Doux shampoo pouches for refilling the original bottle. In the latter  case,  new  and  improved  caps  now  make  it  easier to refill the bottles.\n\nTo limit packaging volumes for its finished products, L'Or\u00e9al has established  a  roadmap  for  reducing  packaging  at  source, as  well  as  its  own  procedures  that  respect  local  regulations and, in most countries, even go beyond these.\n\n## Replace: new sources of materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 26% of the plastic packaging materials were from recycled or biobased sources. \u2611\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2611 The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator.",

In 2022, L'Or\u00e9al used 172,158 tonnes of plastic in its primary, secondary and  tertiary  packaging. The  Group  is  committed  to  using non-fossil sources for 50% of its plastics by 2025 .\n\nIn the context of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group is aiming to reach 100% non-fossil plastic by 2030 .\n\nMany  brands  use recycled  plastic in  their  bottles  (some  as much  as  100%)  as  well  as  other  recycled  materials  in  the packaging  (recycled  glass,  paper  or  aluminium).  In  2022, 94,230 tonnes of recycled materials (1) , including 58,142 tonnes in  primary  and  secondary  packaging,  saved  the  equivalent amount of virgin materials. 78.1% of the volume of PET (2) used by the Group worldwide is recycled PET, i.e. 33,912 tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  example, Garnier Micellar Waters now contain 100% PCR PET (3) . The same efforts have been made with PE (4) containers, in particular the CeraVe bottles, launched in China, which are now made from 100% PCR PE. Other product ranges also use other types of recycled materials. For example, the tubes for Dia Light and Inoa hair dye products are now made from 95% PCR  aluminium.  Recycled  materials  are  not  just  used  for haircare  and  skincare  product  packaging  but  also  makeup, for  example.  In  2022,  the  bottle  for  the  Maybelline  Green Edition Mega Mousse Mascara was made from 96% recycled PP. The bottle for its Tinted Oil is made from 20% recycled glass. For glass packaging, initiatives to integrate recycled glass are continuing to be rolled out in the following product categories: skincare, makeup, perfumes and haircare.\n\nIn order  to  implement  new  circular  solutions  for  plastic packaging, L'Or\u00e9al is working with an ecosystem of partners :\n\n- \u25cf the  L'Or\u00e9al  consortium  with  Carbios  is  developing  a  biorecycling process. This involves using very specific enzymes in  order  to  recycle  PET  plastics  and  polyester  fibres  more broadly.  This  innovative  process  will  produced  a  recycled PET  equivalent  to  virgin  PET.  In  April  2019,  Suntory,  Nestl\u00e9 Waters and Pepsi-Co joined this consortium;\n- \u25cf the  partnership  signed  in  2018  with  LOOP  Industries \u00ae to  depolymerise  post-consumer  PET  into  virgin-quality  PET; and\n- \u25cf the  partnership  signed  in  July  2019  with  PURECYCLE to produce recycled PP.\n\n## Recycle: integration into circular streams\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, 38% of the Group's plastic packaging was refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n\nTarget\n\n2025\n\n%\n\n100\n\nIn  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  New  Plastics  Economy  (NPEC) initiative of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This initiative aims to  rethink  the  life  cycle  of  plastic  so  that  plastic  packaging never  becomes  a  waste  product  and  is  re-inserted into  the circular  economy in  the  form  of  materials  with  biological or technical value.\n\nSince 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has been a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. One specific goal of this partnerhsip is to engage actions  to  have  plastic  packaging  100%  refillable,  reusable, recyclable  or  compostable  by  2025.  This  goal  is  one  of  the commitments  L'Or\u00e9al  made  as  part  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur Global  Commitment.  These  commitments  are  monitored  by the annual Progress Report.\n\nIn  2022,  the  percentage  of  refillable,  reusable,  recyclable or compostable plastic packaging was 38%.\n\nRemoving certain components that interfere with the recycling process improves the recyclability of packaging. For example, Garnier has discontinued the use of metallised labels across its Micellar Waters range in Europe. These measures have helped to eliminate disruptors that interfere with the plastic detection process in automatic sorting centres.\n\nThe Group's brands have  developed  detailed  sorting instructions  for  consumers  to  improve  the  recycling  of  their products.\n\nIn  addition,  in  partnership  with  the  eco-organisation  CITEO, several  L'Or\u00e9al  brands  in  France (5) are  pursuing  a  sorting awareness  campaign  (media,  advertising  etc.).  Lastly,  the ' www.beaute.fr '  platform supports consumers in their process to sort their beauty products at the end of use.\n\n## Environmental impact and tools\n\nTo  evaluate  the  impact  of  its  finished  products,  the  Group makes the following tools available to its design centres:\n\n- \u25cf SPOT (Sustainable  Product  Optimisation  Tool), a  tool  for assessing  the  impact  of  packaging.  Since  2017,  this innovation  has  made  it  possible  to  meet  the  Group's sustainability commitments (see section 4.3.1.3.1.);\n- \u25cf a  tool  to  help  in  reducing  the  environmental  impacts  of transportation packaging  for  packaging  components from  suppliers  to  plants  and  transportation  packaging  of finished  products  from  plants  to  the  Group's  distribution centres, particularly through optimisation of palletisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The purpose of SPICE is to share  the  best  practices  and  methodologies  of  each cosmetics  player  in  order  to  harmonise  and  enhance  the methods used to assess the cosmetic packaging environmental footprint.  L'Or\u00e9al shares its own SPOT Packaging methodology through the SPICE initiative. Tracking of work and achievements, as  well  as  the  plan  for  the  coming  months,  are  accessible  on the  open  platform  www.Open-Spice.com.  The  SPICE  initiative now  has  more  than  34  members  worldwide.  The  dedicated SPICE tool was launched in July 2020.\n\nTo  increase  transparency  towards  consumers,  L'Or\u00e9al  has initiated the roll-out of the PIL (Product Impact Labelling) tool. This involves allocating a score on a scale from A to E for the environmental impact of products , which is made available on the  websites  of  certain  Group  brands  for  eight  formula categories (see section 4.3.1.3.2. B).\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  working  with  its  teams  and suppliers  to  implement  a  global  programme  to  eco-design POS materials and furnishings, which is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 14 robust and pragmatic golden rules;\n- \u00b7 training support for teams and suppliers;\n- \u00b7 monitoring indicators;\n- \u00b7 sharing best practices; and\n- \u00b7 inter-team events on sustainability, including suppliers.\n\nThe  principles  relate  in  particular  to  materials:  recycled materials  and  those  from  biobased  sources,  their  weight, recyclability  or  separability  and  the  optimisation  of  electricity consumption  (for  permanent  POS).  L'Or\u00e9al  is  testing  and developing circular economy processes with its suppliers and local operators, notably in the context of uninstalling, recycling or  donations.  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  share  its  best  practice, for example with the French Federation for Beauty Companies (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Entreprises de la Beaut\u00e9 - FEBEA).\n\nIn  2022, L'Or\u00e9al continued the roll-out of its Sustainable Retail Box  programme.  This  action  plan,  aligned  with  the  highest standards,  sets  out  concrete  actions  for  the  design  and responsible construction of free-standing stores (1) . In 2022, all of the Group's 52 new or renovated stores made a commitment to  an  eco-responsible  process  aligned  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  highest standards. 26 (2) of  them recorded an eco-design rate of over 100% or are certified LEED Gold.\n\nFor  our  permanent  POS  materials,  but  also  our  Free-Standing stores, the Group uses design firms that are experts in lighting to  optimise  energy  consumption  without  compromising  the quality  of  in-store  lighting.  The  pilot  projects  are  promising, in  particular  for  the  reduction  of  environmental  impacts. In  2022,  the  teams  continued  to  roll  out  the  operational guidelines launched in 2021 for new developments.\n\nIn 2022, 97 % of advertising displays at points of sale were eco-designed and 50% of free-standing stores, whether new or refurbished, were designed and built in line with the Group's principles of sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) Consolidated data based on a questionnaire filled out directly by the sales outlets/POS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.1.3.2. Involving consumers in the Group's transformation\n\n## A/ Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nL'Or\u00e9al develops and devises cosmetics that meet the needs of  both  consumers  and  professionals  in  terms  of  quality. As consumer safety is an absolute priority for L'Or\u00e9al, assessing the safety of these formulas and their ingredients is central to any new product development process. It is also a prerequisite for any new product being brought to the market. As a result, consumers  across  the  globe  have  access  to  cosmetics  of identical quality, with proven safety records .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  factories  worldwide  manufacture  cosmetics  that comply  with  ISO  international  standards.  Almost  all  factories are  ISO  9001  certified  and  implement  the  requirements of ISO 22716 on Good Manufacturing Practices for cosmetics. This  standard  sets  out  the  requirements  for  the  production, filling  and  packing,  control,  storage  and  shipment  in  order for a cosmetic product to comply with the defined quality.\n\n100%  of  the  Group's  products  undergo  a  rigorous  safety assessment. A safety report is then prepared.\n\nThe  Worldwide  Human  and  Environmental  Safety  Evaluation Department specifically evaluates the safety of raw materials and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the  toxicological  profile of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  formulas  before  they  are launched on the market. It draws on data from a wide range of  sources:  literature,  in  silico  experiments,  in  vitro  tests  on cellular  models  and  clinical  trials  evaluating  tolerance  in humans. These same safety standards are applied everywhere to  protect  the  health  of  consumers  from  across  the  globe. Once  the  finished  product  is  launched  on  the  market, potential adverse effects are monitored to ensure the safety of the product over its lifetime.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  goes  one  step  further  in  safety  assessments  by monitoring the potential adverse effects that may arise once the  product  is  on  the  market.  The  Group  carries  out  this  task with its international cosmeto-vigilance network, which collects, validates and analyses, using recognised and rigorous methods, the adverse effects related to the use of a cosmetic product. This allows for appropriate corrective measures to be taken where necessary.",

        "page_content": "Policies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe safety cycle is summarised in the following graphic:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The product safety assessment process\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  process  to  ensure  that  all  products developed  by  the  Group,  whatever  the  geographical location  of  the  laboratory  in  charge  of  the  project, are subject to the same level of rigorous safety evaluation. The  Worldwide  Safety  Evaluation  Department  carries  out these  evaluations,  based  on  a  multidisciplinary  scientific approach,  at  all  stages  of  a  product's  life  cycle.  L'Or\u00e9al therefore  meets  the  safety  requirements  of  the  national regulations in force in all countries in which its products are put on sale.\n\n## A  safety  assessment  is  conducted  for  each  product launched on the market\n\nProduct  safety  evaluation  is  based  on  evaluating  each constituent  ingredient  and  the  finished  product  itself.  It  is carried  out  on  the  basis  of  existing  safety  data  and  the latest scientific knowledge, and takes into consideration the conditions  of  use  of  the  product.  If  necessary,  L'Or\u00e9al conducts additional  safety  studies  in  qualified  laboratories all  over the world. Experienced scientists who are specially trained in safety issues with regard to cosmetic ingredients and products interpret the results.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles,  rooted  in  both  scientific  rigour and  responsiveness  to  societal  concerns,  lead  to  a  preemptive  approach.  This  means  that  formulations  are evolved by removing and/or replacing certain substances on the basis of new data.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's added value, in terms of the safety assessment of ingredients  and  finished  products,  lies  in  its  investment for  nearly  40  years  in  the  development  of  predictive methods  and  tissue  engineering,  and  their  international\n\nIn responding to questions that civil society may ask regarding certain  substances  and  their  effects  on  health  and  the environment, three points summarise L'Or\u00e9al's position:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u00b7 cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u00b7 precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nThe  launch  of  the  website  'Au  coeur  de  nos  produits'(Inside our  products)  in  2019  is  testimony  to  the  Group's  desire  for increased transparency on this issue.\n\nFinally,  production  quality  standards  govern  the  quality  of products,  for  all  stages  from  creation  and  production  to distribution. Almost all factories are ISO 9001 certified for their production  and  follow  the  Best  Manufacturing  Practices  in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard.\n\nregulatory recognition. For many years, the Group has been investing  in  science  and  technology  to  create  new evaluation  tools  which  are  used  every  day  by  safety assessors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also works  closely with all the international stakeholders  involved  in  relevant  industries  in  order  to develop  alternative  cross-disciplinary  solutions  in  the  field of safety assessment.\n\nThis  longstanding  commitment  means  that  since  1989,  or 14  years  before  regulations  required,  the  Group  no  longer carries  out  animal  testing  in  laboratories  for  any  of  its products.  Equally,  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tests  its  ingredients on  animals.  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tolerates  any  exceptions  to this rule and this applies worldwide. The Group also does not delegate  responsibility  for  doing  so  to  anyone  else. Some health  authorities  may  nevertheless  decide  to  carry out animal testing themselves for certain cosmetic products and  this  is  still  the  case  in  China.  For  more  than  10  years, L'Or\u00e9al has been the company most committed to getting Chinese  authorities  and  scientists  to  recognise  alternative methods  and  changing  cosmetic  regulations  to  achieve the  complete  and  final  elimination  of  animal  testing. Progress  made  in  2014  put  an  end  to  testing  on  animals of  some  products  manufactured  in  China.  Since  2021, non-functional  products  imported  into  China  no  longer need to be tested on animals if they are accompanied by a  safety  assessment  and  a  manufacturing  best  practice certificate issued by their country of origin.\n\nUltimately,  L'Or\u00e9al's  products  continually  evolve  as  and when  technological  innovations  occur,  but  with  the constant desire to guarantee the highest level of safety for both consumers and professionals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  takes  into consideration 14 planetary impact factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, water stress, ocean acidification or the impact on biodiversity.\n\nThese impacts are measured at each step in the life cycle of a product and calculated by taking into account not only the cultivation and extraction of raw materials and the processing and  transport  of  the  product,  but  also  the  usage  phase  by the consumer and the recyclability of the packaging.\n\nThis  information  is  accessible  to  consumers  on  the  product pages  of  our  brands'  websites.  The  first  phase  of  the  roll-out began  in  France  with  the  Garnier  haircare  category  in  July 2020.  The  information  is  now  available  for  four  product categories  (shampoo,  conditioner  &  mask,  face  wash,  body wash), five  international  brands  (Biotherm,  Garnier,  La  Roche Posay,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  Vichy),  and  in  twenty-three  European countries, the United States, Canada, Mexico and Indonesia.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  sectoral approach,  coming  together  with  its  competitors  to  form  the EcoBeautyScore  Consortium ,  which  aims  at  developping  a\n\ncommon  environmental  labelling  system  for  the  entire cosmetics  industry.  This  system  is  backed  by  a  scientific methodology for measuring environmental impacts in line with the recommendations of the European Commission, similar to the  one  used  by  the  Group  for  its  environmental  labelling initiative.  Alongside  the  other  members, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to  sharing  its  experience  in  this  field  within  the  Consortium in compliance with anti-trust legislation.\n\nIn  view  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  active  contribution  to  the  development of  the  EcoBeautyScore,  the  Group  slowed  down  in  2022  the deployment of its own system for displaying the environmental and  social  impact  of  its  products.  However,  in  2023  it  will continue to roll it out to new brands and new markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, an environmental impact score was calculated for 83% of the Group's rinse-off products. Labelling showing these scores, together with their social impact data, will be gradually rolled out in our markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental and societal commitment of L'Or\u00e9al brands\n\nConscious  of  the  influencing  ability  of  its  brands,  L'Or\u00e9al encourages  them  to  inform  and  mobilise  their  stakeholders around  major  environmental  and  societal  challenges.  Each brand  must  therefore  identify  a  cause  of  its  own,  support  a community  partner  involved  in  the  field  and  conduct awareness-raising campaigns with the wider public.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme, the Group has made a commitment that three million people will  benefit  from  its  brands'  social  engagement  programmes by 2030. In 2022, 22 brands have activated a cause program in  partnership  with  NGOs,  leading  to  a  support  brought  to more than 2,500,000 beneficiaries (2) .\n\n| L'Or\u00e9al Paris             | L'Or\u00e9al Paris is backing the  Stand Up against street harassment   programme in partnership with the NGO Right To Be. In  2022,  more  than  800,000  people  in  more  than  41  countries  learned  how  to  react  safely  to  street  harassment.

GHG assessment: an annual exercise\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  carries  out  an  annual  Greenhouse  Gas  assessment (GHG assessment or balance) for all the Group's activities, in order  to  measure  its  CO2  emissions  and  identify  the  action plans  that  will  enable  to  reduce  its  impact.  Performed  since 2007,  this  assessment  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  the Greenhouse Gas Protocol ( GHG  Protocol ) rules, the international  reference  method  for  recording  GHG  emissions. It  makes  it  possible  to  determine  the  Group's  total  carbon footprint  in  three  categories  -  Scopes  -  defined  above  in section 4.3.1.1.3.\n\nIn  2022,  the  GHG  assessment  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  was estimated at 11,270 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 - emissions measured and reported on a monthly basis\n\nScopes 1 and 2 correspond to those for which the Group takes direct action:\n\n- \u25cf By implementing energy sobriety approaches and significantly improving the energy efficiency approaches of buildings, equipment and industrial processes;\n- \u25cf by making local contributions to the transition to renewable energies in the countries or sites where the Group operates. L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  an  ambitious  renewable  energy policy  that  prioritises  on-site  production  and  consumption (self-consumption); long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA);  and  finally  the  purchase  of  locally  produced renewable energy.\n\nThese  CO2  emissions  are  measured  by  all  the  Group's  sites and reported monthly.\n\n|                                           | 2025 TARGETS      | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Industrial sites                          | - 100% (vs. 2005) | -81%   | -87%   | -91%   |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | - 100% (vs. 2016) | -76%   | -83%   | -91%   |\n\n## Changes in the published figures for Scopes 1 and 2 since 2016 (in thousands of tonnes of CO2 equivalent) (1)\n\n|              |                                            |   2016 |   2017 (2) |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 | 2022   |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1      | Industrial sites                           |   55.5 |       49.7 |   46.6 |   43.6 |   39   |   25.9 | 18.9 \u2611 |\n|              | Administrative sites and  research centres |    6.5 |        8   |    7.7 |    6.4 |    4.1 |    1.8 | 0.9    |\n|              | Group                                      |   62   |       57.7 |   54.3 |   50   |   43.1 |   27.7 | 19.7   |\n| Scope 2      | Industrial sites                           |   25.7 |       15.9 |    8.9 |    8.2 |    7   |    5.7 | 2.5 \u2611  |\n|              | Administrative sites and  research centres |   26.5 |       25.3 |   25.7 |   22.1 |    5.7 |    4.9 | 2.9    |\n|              | Group                                      |   52.2 |       41.2 |   34.6 |   30.3 |   12.6 |   10.6 | 5.4    |\n| Scopes 1 + 2 | Industrial sites                           |   81.2 |       65.7 |   55.5 |   51.8 |   46   |   31.6 | 21.3 \u2611 |\n|              | Administrative sites and  research centres |   32.9 |       33.2 |   33.4 |   28.5 |    9.8 |    6.7 | 3.8    |\n|              | Group                                      |  114.2 |       98.9 |   88.9 |   80.3 |   55.8 |   38.3 | 25.1   |\n\n## Scope 3 - emissions estimated annually\n\nScope 3 covers all other greenhouse gas emissions not directly related to the sites operated by the Group or to the processing of products in the factories but to other stages in its life cycle (procurement, transportation, use, end of life, etc.) and other impacts related to the Group's activities (business travel, etc.). These  emissions  are  the  subject  of  an  annual  estimate according to the GHG Protocol methodology.\n\nIn  2022,  work  was  carried  out  on  Scope  3  of  the  GHG Assessment  in  order  to  improve  its  input  data,  limits  and emission  factors.  For  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  Group's  Scope  3  is estimated at 11,245 thousand tonnes, an increase of around 0.7  million  tonnes  compared  to  2021,  primarily  due  to  direct and indirect purchases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate commitments relating to Scope 3\n\nThe Group's commitments to low-carbon operations management have led to initiatives and achievements aimed at reducing the important categories under Scope 3:\n\n- \u25cf Since 2009, L'Or\u00e9al has involved its suppliers in the process of  reducing  its  carbon  footprint  by  encouraging  them to  participate  in  the CDP  Supply  Chain programme (see section 4.3.1.2.2.).\n- \u25cf In 2013, L'Or\u00e9al committed to reduce the carbon impact of downstream  transportation  of  its  finished  products  by  20% per  unit  sold  per  kilometre  between  2011  and  2020 (see section 4.5.2.1).\n- \u25cf In 2015, L'Or\u00e9al undertook to define Science-Based Targets (SBTs)  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  across  its entire value chain and over the long term, in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In December 2017,  the  SBT  initiative  validated  the  Group's  proposal: by  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  reducing  by  25%  in absolute value the greenhouse gas emissions of Scopes 1, 2 and 3 compared to 2016 (with full coverage of the items of Scope 3, in accordance with the definition of the GHG Protocol). By 2025, the Group is also committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sites it operates by 100% through energy efficiency programmes and a supply made up  exclusively  of  renewable  energy.  These  commitments were  revaluated  in  2019  over  Scopes  1  and  2  by  the  SBT initiative and considered to be in compliance with the new SBT  1.5\u00b0C  criteria.  Roadmaps  were  deployed  within  the different  business  lines  (packaging,  research,  sourcing, supply  chain  etc.)  so  that  each  one  contributes  to  the reduction  of  CO2  emissions  in  Scopes  1,  2  and  3.  Specific tracking  allows  each  of  the  segments  to  monitor  its  own performance;\n- \u25cf In September 2019, L'Or\u00e9al joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative, a call to action for the climate launched by a  broad  coalition  of  companies,  civil  society  and  UN leaders.  The  Group  has  committed  to  zero  net  CO2 emissions by 2050 and, in this way, is contributing to limiting the  increase  in  global  temperature  to  1.5\u00b0C  above  preindustrial levels.\n- \u25cf in June 2020, in the context of the launch of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future  and  in  line  with  its  SBT  commitment,  the  Group  set out  its roadmap  for  2030.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to a  reduction,  compared  with  2016,  of  25%  per  finished product  in  the  emissions  associated  with  the  product  use phase, a 50% reduction in the direct emissions of its strategic suppliers  and  a  50%  reduction  per  finished  product  in  the emissions associated with product transportation.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al reduced its Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 5% in absolute terms compared to 2016.\n\n## 4.3.1.4.3. The Group's alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) principles\n\nConscious  of  the  climate  emergency,  L'Or\u00e9al  hopes  to transition  to  an  innovative  low-carbon  company  model  and will make  increasing  contributions  to  combating  climate change.  The  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  rolled  out globally  in  2013,  has  helped  establish  a  culture  in  which environmental  impacts  and  climate  change  are  taken  into account  in  the  decision-making  process  of  each  of  the Group's business activities.\n\n(1)\n\nThe acceleration of the environmental and social challenges requires a more radical transformation. Since 2015, L'Or\u00e9al has been  one  of  the  100  leading  companies  to  join  the  SBT initiative  by  aligning  its  path  to  decarbonisation  with  climate science. In June 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced its new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. It includes a new set of very ambitious objectives  over  the  entire  value  chain  for  2030:  efforts  to combat  climate  change,  preservation  of  water  resources, forestry and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al publicly committed to adopt the recommendations  of  the  TCFD.  The  Group  committed  to incorporate  climate  issues  in  their  strategy  and  to  provide consistent,  reliable  and  clear  information  to  allow  investors  to take into account climate-related financial risks in their decisions.\n\nAlong with this dynamic move towards a low-carbon transition, L'Or\u00e9al  intends  to  fully  manage  the  risks  and  opportunities related to climate change, anticipate their effects and ensure its resilience. L'Or\u00e9al is adapting its business model, governance  and  decision-making  processes,  research  and Operations  in  respect  of  its  values  and  sense  of  purpose: 'Create the beauty that moves the world.'\n\n## Governance\n\nEvery year, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors determines the Group's strategic  orientations,  which  integrate  the  challenges,  risks  and opportunities of climate change and, more generally, the issues of sustainable development (see sections 2.3.2. and 2.3.4.).\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  (CSO) (1) ,  who  is  a member of  the  Executive  Committee,  reports  directly  to  the Chief  Executive  Officer.  She  reports  on  the  Group's  activities every  year  to  the  Board  of  Directors  or  to  the  Strategy  and Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe  Chief  Sustainability  Officer  is  responsible  for  defining  and implementing the sustainable development strategy. Her tasks include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  and  managing  the  climate-related  risks  and opportunities  through  sustainability  programmes  ( Sharing Beauty With All and L'Or\u00e9al for the Future );\n- \u00b7 leading an internal sustainability committee, which includes experts  responsible  for  the  rollout  of  these  programmes and  their  associated  policies.  These  experts  come  from the  Operations,  Research,  Public  Affairs,  Communication, Divisions and Brands departments;\n- \u00b7 guaranteeing  the  implementation  of  the  orientations  and decisions adopted by this Committee;\n- \u00b7 defining  annual  climate-related  objectives  and  ensuring their deployment throughout the L'Or\u00e9al value chain; and\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  level  of  commitment  of  all  of  the  Brands, Country Managers  and  subsidiaries in implementing the climate and sustainable development  strategy. This  implementation  determines  a  portion  of  the  variable remuneration  of the Brand and  Country  Managers (see section 4.1.).\n\nThe  mission  of  the Sustainable  Finance  Department ,  created in 2020, is to integrate the climate change-related environmental and  social challenges from a financial standpoint.  This  Department,  which  reports  to  the  Chief Financial  Officer  and  the  Chief  Sustainability  Officer,  aims  to develop and direct Sustainable Finance actions. This primarily involves  enabling  the  Group  to  manage  sustainable  and financial development performance in an integrated manner and to coordinate their actions globally.\n\nIn 2022, this Department was in charge of updating the study assessing the financial impacts of climate change risks for the Group (see section 4.1.).",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nThe concept behind the main environmental risks covers risks related to the impact of the Group's business activities on its ecosystem and the risks  of  the  impact  of  climate  change  in the short and medium-term on its business model, activity and financial performance.\n\nThe Group has identified four main risks and three opportunities relating  to  the  physical  and  transition-related  risks  associated with  climate  change.  There  is  the  potential  for  these  risks  to have  consequences  on  the  value  chain,  business  activities and the development of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe  in-depth  analyses  cover  the  identification  of  and  a dynamic  approach  to  these  risks,  the  evaluation  of  their impacts using scenarios developed on two assumptions based on the 1.5\u00b0C and 3-4\u00b0C paths, and the integration of political, economic,  social,  technological,  environmental  and  legal trends (PESTEL analysis).\n\n## Scenarios\n\nThese analyses were carried out according to the RCP 1.9 and RCP8.5 (1) scenarios  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) to identify and assess the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 A  'governed  transition'  scenario  on  the  basis  of  global warming of +1.5\u00b0C in 2100 (scenario RCP 1.9). It is based on a structured transition and restrictive regulation, with strong international cooperation, major increased consumer awareness  of  climate  and  external  effects  and,  globally, actions  to  anticipate  and  attenuate  climate  change  in  a more responsible world based on solidarity.\n- \u00b7 A 'disorganised transition'  scenario  on  the  basis  of  global warming of 3-4\u00b0C in 2100 (RCP 8.5 scenario). It is based on assumptions  of  limited  international  cooperation,  growing tensions  on  trade,  economic  stagnation  or  slowdown, significant  physical  impacts  and,  generally,  a  primarily reactive adaptation to climate change.\n\nTwo  timeframes  were  considered : a  medium-term  2030 timeframe  and  a  long-term  2050  timeframe  with  the  aim  of identifying  impacts  associated  with  climate  assumptions  at these dates.\n\nBusiness  experts  from  the  Purchasing,  Packaging,  Logistics, Research & Innovation, Sustainable Development, Prospective and Consumer Studies teams were called on for this risk and opportunities analysis.\n\nStudies  have  been  conducted  on  the  impact  of  the  supply of plant-based raw materials on climate change.\n\nAssumptions have been made on: the paths of carbon pricing, the  expectations  of  stakeholders  and  consumer  preferences. These  assumptions  represent  the  main  exposure  factors  of L'Or\u00e9al to climate transition risks.\n\nThis work enables the Group to adapt its policies and define its strategic  objectives  in  regard  to  the  risks  and  opportunities associated  with  global  warming.  Notably,  the  results  of  this study  and  the  action  plans  were  presented  to  the  Chief Sustainability Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe Group's risk review includes physical risks and transition risks associated  with  Operations  and  changes  in  its  value  chain and  ecosystem.  Risks  as  diverse  as  those  associated  with extreme weather events on the Group's infrastructures, or the risks inherent in the supply chain, those inherent in the scarcity of resources, carbon pricing (taxes, emissions trading schemes) and  their  financial  impacts  or  those  related  to  the  Group's reputation and consumer expectations are analysed. They  lead  to  impact  assessment  procedures  as  part  of  the scenarios  created  and  contribute  to  defining  strategic orientations.\n\nThe following main risks and opportunities were studied.\n\nRisk  1 : regulations  concerning  carbon  pricing  mechanisms (specific  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  carbon  taxes,  and  emissions trading schemes) are a major challenge for the Group and its suppliers.  In  this  context,  an  increase  in  the  price  per  tonne of  direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  suppliers  could  be reflected in the sale prices of their products and services and have  an  impact  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  operating  costs.  In  order  to mitigate  this  risk,  the  Group  is  working  with  its  suppliers, in  particular  through  the  CDP  Supply  Chain,  to  ensure  they devise  and  implement  emissions  reduction  targets  and associated action plans (see section 4.3.1.2).\n\nRisk 2: changes in consumer preferences towards consumption  choices  increasingly  influenced  by  the  carbon footprint of products and the overall climate performance of plants  could  have  a  material  financial  impact,  progressively and in the medium-term, for L'Or\u00e9al. If this risk was insufficiently managed,  the  reduction  in  consumer  demand  could potentially  have  a  negative  impact  on  revenue  for  L'Or\u00e9al. To  prevent  this  risk,  the  Group's  strategy  is  to  continue  to reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products  and  enable consumers  to  make  informed  purchasing  decisions.  They  will be informed in  a  way  that  is  both  transparent  and  responds to their expectations  of  the  challenges  of  sustainable development (see section  4.3.1.3.2).  The  study  also  took  into account  the  more  general  assumptions  associated  with  the company's  transformation  as  well  as  changes  in  consumer purchasing power, according to the scenarios considered.\n\nRisk  3 : as  a  world  leader  in  cosmetics,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  dependent upon  the  availability  of  the  materials  used  for  its  product packaging.  The  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  is accompanied  by  developments  in  the  design  of  more sustainable and innovative packaging and materials. Increased competition in the sustainable packaging materials market ,  resulting  in  a  shortage of associated materials, could have  an  impact  on  L'Or\u00e9al.  These  factors  may  result  in  an increase in the average price of packaging materials and in production costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The analyses and estimates carried out to  date  indicate  that  the  overall  change  in  the  costs  of  the main agricultural commodities (palm oil, coconuts, sugar cane and sugar beet, soy) would be more impacted in the medium term by changes in supply and demand than by the effects of  climate  change  on  the  crop  yield  of  these  commodities. However,  extreme  weather  events  could  occasionally  affect the  availability  of  certain  commodities,  forcing  an  increase in  costs.  The  climatic  phenomena  el  Ni\u00f1o  and  la  Ni\u00f1a,  for example,  had  an  impact  on  the  availability  of  plant commodities coming from Southeast Asia.\n\nOpportunity  1: current  and  future  regulations  and  standards, which  are  linked  to  the  environmental  footprint  of  products and  their  labels,  will  help  increase  consumer  awareness  to these  subjects. In France,  recent  studies  suggest  that consumers  are  paying  an  increasing  amount  of  attention  to product labels and  want  to  make  more  sustainable consumption choices.\n\nThis may offer players in the cosmetics sector who have opted for fair and transparent communication on their environmental and  social  impact  a  competitive  advantage  resulting  in  an increase  in  demand.  The  multi-criteria  approach  of  L'Or\u00e9al to the impact of products beyond regulatory standards makes it a  pioneer.  The  development  of SPOT , followed  by  the environmental  labelling  system,  meets  the  high  expectations of  consumers  and  informs  them  of  the  carbon  footprint  of products and a variety of other environmental criteria.\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al committed to a sectoral approach by coming together  with  its  competitors  to  form  the EcoBeautyScore Consortium ,  which  aims  to  develop  a  scientific  methodology for measuring environmental impacts.\n\nOpportunity 2: a market opportunity consists in innovating and developing products adapted for consumers located in areas of water stress .  One of the consequences of climate change is  the  increase  in  the  number  of  the  world's  regions  facing periods  of  water  shortage,  particularly  in  urban  areas. The  increasing  frequency  of  these  shortages  could  lead  to changes  in  consumer  habits  in  terms  of  showering  and hair-washing, for example.\n\nIn  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  could  increase  the  development  of new  products,  routines  or  new  technologies  that  improve rinsing  or  save  water  in  the  use  phase,  thereby  increasing consumer awareness of the challenges of water quality  and availability.\n\nOpportunity 3: globally, there is a trend towards an increase in the price of non-renewable energies in the medium term. This trend  is  linked  to  the  regulations  and  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  as well as the complex balance between supply and demand.\n\nThe progressive elimination by  L'Or\u00e9al  of  the  use  of conventional  fuels  in  favour  of  renewable  energies  would protect  the  Group  from  increases  in  the  fossil  fuel  prices, contributing to operating costs that are lower than those paid by  other  manufacturers  who  are  insufficiently  committed  to\n\nthis  energy  transition.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to  using 100% renewable  energy  at  all  its  operated  sites  by  2025 , by developing  projects  for  self-supply  of  renewable  energies on-site, as well as a 100% local and renewable energy supply (electricity, heat, biogas etc.). L'Or\u00e9al has already started on this  path  with,  for  example,  the  completion  of  a  series  of projects for its own consumption of renewable energy on-site in  locations  such  as  the  United  States,  Western  Europe,  Brazil, China and Australia.\n\n## Methods for managing risks and opportunities\n\nThe  Ethics,  Risks  and  Compliance  Department  identifies  and assesses  risks  with  all  departments  concerned.  An  additional risk  analysis  is  conducted  within  the  operational  entities,  in particular for the physical risks associated with climate change.\n\nContributions  are  collected  from  the  main  operational managers  and  experts  in  this  area  worldwide,  across  all the Group's  business  activities and  geographic  zones. Climate-related  risks  are  the  subject  of  a  regularly  updated, specific  approach  that  identifies  and  assesses  their  financial and strategic impact when the reputation or long-term growth\n\nof the Group are concerned.\n\nThe  Group's  global  risk  map  is  reviewed  regularly ,  validated by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Executive  Committee  once  a  year  and presented  to  the  Audit  Committee.  The  Group's  risk  review process and the regular update of the climate study allow for the constant adaptation of policies and priorities. The targets and action plans implemented as part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future are  a  significant  contribution  to  moderating  the  climate  risks that have been identified.\n\n## Measurement of results and reporting\n\nIn  2013,  the  Group  defined  a  number  of  environmental indicators as part of the first generation of their Sharing Beauty with  All  commitments.  Re-evaluated  and  completed  in  June 2020 as part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  these  indicators  cover the Group's entire value chain in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions,  water,  biodiversity,  resources  and  waste.  They support the goals for 2030. Their progress is published annually (see section 1.3.2).\n\nIn  terms  of  climate  change,  the  goals  announced  in  the context  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  are  aligned  with  the Science-Based  Targets  initiative  that  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  in  2015. In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  reducing  greenhouse gas emissions  over  its  entire  value  chain  (Scopes  1,  2  and  3) by 25% in absolute value (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) and by 50%  per  finished  product  by  2030,  compared  with  2016. In 2022, the Group's total CO2 emissions fell by 6.2% compared to 2016.\n\nIn  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  United  Nations  Business  Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative and made a commitment to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nA  GHG  balance  is  prepared  and  published  annually  and details  emissions  over  all  the  items  described  by  the  GHG Protocol.",

Alignment with the European Taxonomy\n\nThe European Taxonomy primarily targets sectors that have a strong  potential  for  contributing  to  the  adaptation  to  or mitigation of climate change, in which L'Or\u00e9al is not included.\n\n## Reminder  of  the  regulatory  environment  and  the  L'Or\u00e9al sustainable development strategy\n\nPursuant  to  the  European  'Taxonomy'  Regulation,  L'Or\u00e9al  is required  to  publish  indicators  for  the  2022  financial  year highlighting,  since  2021,  the  eligible  share,  and  from  2022, the  aligned  share  of  its  turnover  investments  and  operating expenses  considered  sustainable  within  the  meaning  of  this Regulation.  To  date,  it  only  covers  the  first  two  objectives  of the  Taxonomy  Regulation:  climate  change  mitigation  and adaptation  to  climate  change.  To  do  this,  the  Finance  and Legal,  Operations,  Real  Estate,  CSR,  Research  &  Innovation Departments have jointly conducted a detailed analysis of all the Group's activities within the consolidated entities.\n\nEligible activities and  their  level  of  alignment  with  the Taxonomy  Regulation  have  been  identified  in  accordance with  the  instructions  of  the  Delegated  Acts  by  verifying whether  they  contribute  substantially  to  climate  change, whether any of the five other objectives set by the Taxonomy Regulation (1) have  not  been  met  and  whether  they  comply with the minimum guarantees.\n\nIn its classification system, the European Commission prioritises business sectors with a strong potential for contributing to the adaptation  or  mitigation  of  climate  change.  Within  the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation, activities carried out by L'Or\u00e9al that are dedicated to beauty care are not considered to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  these  initial  climate targets. The low level of eligibility and alignment of the Group's Taxonomy indicators does not reflect the environmental pillar of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  sustainable  development  strategy  or  its  strong commitment  to  combating  climate  change,  which  it  has demonstrated for many years.\n\nThe  goals  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  and  the  2022  results  are described in greater detail in sections 4.3.1 and 4.4.\n\n## Presentation of the eligibility and alignment results for 2022\n\nSales indicator: as  was  the  case  for  2021,  the  Group  has  not identified  any  eligible  turnover  L'Or\u00e9al  is  dedicated  solely  to the  beauty  industry  and,  as  such,  its  activities  are  not considered, within the meaning of the Taxonomy, as making a significant  contribution  to  these  initial  climate  targets  or  as  a priority  sector  targeted  by  the  Taxonomy.  In  particular,  its industrial  activities  in  the  production  of  raw  materials  are  not covered  by  the  Taxonomy  Regulation  under  the  heading 'Manufacture of organic basic chemicals'.\n\nInvestment indicator :  as  there  were no eligible turnover there were  no  investments  corresponding  to  activities  related  to sales that could be classified as eligible. As a result, the various measures implemented to reduce the carbon footprint of the Group's  products  have  not  been  taken  into  account  in  the indicators  relating  to  investments.  Likewise,  all  investments used  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  the  entire  product production  value  chain  are  classified  as  ineligible  by  the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIt  should be noted that these investments do not include the amount  of \u20ac100  million  allocated  to  Impact  Investing  funds intended  to  finance  the  regeneration  of  damaged  natural ecosystems and the fight against climate change. Investments made in funds are not considered eligible expenditure under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe eligibility analysis of the investments was therefore focused on  'individual  measures'  to  reduce  the  Group's  emissions, which  explains  why  the  eligible  amounts  are  low  compared to  all  Group  investments,  a  significant  portion  of  which  is dedicated  to  implementing  the  sustainable  development strategy.\n\nThe eligible investments identified mainly correspond to:\n\n- \u00b7 Capitalised  leases  on  buildings  and  vehicles  according  to IFRS 16 (89%);\n- \u00b7 Expenditure  on  construction  and  renovation  of  buildings designed  to  improve  their  energy  efficiency  and  mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; and\n- \u00b7 Installation and repair of equipment that promotes energy efficiency.\n\nIn  2022, eligible investments totalled to \u20ac434 million (including \u20ac387 million related to long-term capitalised leases on buildings and  vehicles  according  to  IFRS  16),  compared  to  total investments  of  \u20ac2,011  million  as  defined  by  the  Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn 2021, the amount of eligible Capex (2) stood at \u20ac405 million. The change in the eligible balance in 2022 compared to the 2021  financial  year  is  primarily  the  result  of  the  frequency of  lease  renewals.  As  a  result,  it  does  not  correlate  with  the Group's investment policy on actions to adapt to or mitigate climate change.\n\nAligned investments in 2022 totalled \u20ac180 million.\n\nThe  alignment  level  for  the  2022  financial  year  was  classified with  care  and  using  the  currently  accepted  marketplace practices  in  order  to  validate  the  three  conditions  required for alignment:\n\n- (3) \u00b7 Substantial  contribution  and  DNSH criteria :  The  Group's property  policy  incorporates  high  standards  in  terms  of energy consumption and building labelling. The Group will continue to update and ensure the implementation of the Purchasing  Charter  and  the  Sustainable  Design  and Construction  Guide  for  construction  and  leasing  projects, in order to best address the climate issues described in the Taxonomy.\n- \u00b7 Compliance  with  the  minimum  safeguards: The  Group meets  the  requirements  on  minimum  safeguards  listed  in the Platform on Sustainable Finance's (PSF) report. The four themes are specified in other sections:\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a  Group-wide  Code  of  Ethics as  well  as  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Vigilance  Plan,  which  contains reasonable due diligence measures intended to prevent the risk of serious adverse impacts on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as health, safety and the environment  within  the  framework  of  a  best  efforts obligation (see sections 3.4.4.1. and 3.4.5.1.);\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  method  will  be  integrated  into  the  Group's investment validation processes in a more systematic way over the  coming  years.  The  Group  will  continue  to  adapt  its alignment and eligibility  analysis  and  methodology in light  of changes  to  the  regulations,  listed  activities  and  technical review criteria relating to the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nOperating expenses indicator: As there were no eligible sales, there were no operating expenses corresponding to activities related to sales that could be qualified as eligible. As a result, the  various  measures  implemented  to  reduce  the  carbon footprint  of  the  Group's  products  have  not  been  taken  into account  in  the  performance  indicators  relating  to  operating expenses.\n\nThe Opex (1) denominator required by the Taxonomy Regulation  is  primarily  composed  of  R&I  costs  (\u20ac1,139  million in  2022).  It  represents  a  low  percentage  of  the  Group's operating  expenses.  In  light  of  this  low  weighting,  the  Group applies the Taxonomy Regulation exemption that allows them not to calculate the Opex numerator and reports this amount as 0.\n\nFurthermore, L'Or\u00e9al concluded that its Research & Innovation programmes are not eligible because they do not fall within the scope of the activities currently covered by the Taxonomy (heavy  chemicals).  R&I  at  L'Or\u00e9al  is  focused  towards  Green Sciences  (as  described  in  section  4.3.1.3.1.).  The  allocated annual budget for this was \u20ac1,139 million in 2022.\n\n## Sales\n\n|                                                                                                  |                                 | Substantial  contribution  criteria   | Substantial  contribution  criteria        | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s   | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s   | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s                       | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s   | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s   | Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria  ion c t io n r ce s                                       |                                  |                                                                                 | tiv i t y)                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                  | A b s o l u t e  tu r n o v e r | Pr o p o r t io n o f t u r n ov er   | C l i m a t e  ch a n g e mi t i g a tio n | C l i m a t e  ch a n g e ad ap t a t                         | C l i m a t e  ch a n g e ad ap t a t ion                     | S u s t ain a b le  us e an d  p r o t e o f  w a te r  a n d m ar i n e r e so u | T r a n s i t i on  tow a r d s a c ir c ul a r ec o no m y   | P o ll ut i o n P r e v e n ti o n & C o n t r ol             | Pr o t e ct i on  a n d  r e s t o r a ti o n o f  b iod i v e rsi ty a nd a n d e c o s y ste ms | M i n i m u m  s a fe g u ar d s | T axo n o m y - a l ig n e d p r o por ti o n o f t ur n ov er , ye a r 2 0 2 2 | Cat e gor y  ( e n a bl i n g ac |\n| Economic activities                                                                              | \u20acm                              | %                                     | %                                          | %                                                             | Yes/ No                                                       | Yes/ No                                                                           | Yes/ No                                                       | Yes/ No                                                       | Yes/ No                                                                                           | Yes/ No                          | %                                                                               | M                                |\n| A.

Contributing to solving the environmental challenges of the world\n\nIn  addition  to  transforming  its  economic  model,  the  Group's ambition is  to  help  to  solve  some  of  the  most  pressing  social and environmental challenges.\n\n## 4.3.1.5.1. Accelerating the development of the circular economy\n\nConscious  of  the  growing  pressure  on  natural  resources  and the  global  waste  crisis,  at  the  end  of  2020  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a global  investment  fund  dedicated  exclusively  to  the  circular economy, called the Circular Innovation Fund (CIF). It aims to finance  companies  that  are  innovating  in  the  areas  of recycling, plastic waste management and materials from the bioeconomy (1) .\n\nThis  international  fund,  the  objective  of  which  is  to  reach \u20ac150  million,  is  co-managed  by  Cycle  Capital  Management and Demeter. At the end of 2022, more than \u20ac85 million raised and gathered 10 co-investors.  As the primary sponsor of the Circular  Innovation  Fund,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  investing  a total of  \u20ac50  million in  this  Fund.  More  than  560  investment projects  were  analysed  in  2022,  and  three  were  selected, committing    more  than  \u20ac15  million,  of  which  \u20ac6  million  have already  been  invested.  In  2022,  for  example,  the  CIF  fund invested  in  LIZEE (2) ,  a  company  which  specialises  in  reverse logistics on the repair and second-hand market.",

Contributing to the regeneration of nature\n\nAs  part  of  its  commitment  to  preserving  biodiversity,  L'Or\u00e9al launched the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Nature Regeneration (1) in 2020. This \u20ac50 million impact investment fund, managed by Mirova, is intended to combine financial performance with the creation of  environmental  and  social  value.  By  supporting  projects  to rehabilitate (2) degraded  soils,  regenerate  mangroves,  and restore  marine  areas  and  forests,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Nature Regeneration  aims  to  help  preserve  or  restore  one  million hectares of  ecosystem,  to  capture  15  to  20  million  tonnes  of CO2 and create hundreds of jobs by 2030. Since the fund was\n\nlaunched,  more  than  one  hundred  projects  have  been considered  for  the  purposes  of  building  the  investment portfolio. At the end of 2022, fifteen projects were selected for further  study,  and  eleven  investment  projects  totalling  more than  \u20ac22  million  were  validated.  For  example,  in  April  2022, the  L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Nature  Regeneration  invested  in  the technology  start-up  RIZE,  whose  mission  is  to  accelerate  the transition to low-carbon agriculture. The investment will enable RIZE  to  become  a  pioneer  in  the  regeneration  of  farmland in  France  and  Europe  by  means  of  a  digital  solution  and a unique service for farmers. RIZE's aim is to contribute to the regeneration of over 2.5 million hectares and the sequestration of 4 million tonnes  of CO2  by  providing  support  to 75,000 farmers by 2025.\n\n## 4.3.1.6. Issuance of a sustainability-linked bond\n\nOn 22 March 2022, the Group issued its first Sustainability-linked bond. This fixed-rate issue, which has a maturity of four years and  three  months  and  amounts  to  \u20ac1,250  million,  is accompanied by a coupon of 0.875% per year. It is aligned with  the  Group's  Sustainability-Linked  Financing  Framework, which covers all financial instruments with characteristics that are linked to the sustainability objectives.\n\nThe  bond  was  established  with  reference  to  the  2020 Sustainability-Linked  Bond  Principles  ('SLBP  2020')  as  defined by the International Capital Market Association.\n\nThe  Group's  Sustainability-Linked  Financing  Framework  was independently assessed by Sustainalytics, an organisation that evaluates the sustainability  of  listed  companies,  which  noted contributions  to  three  of  the  United  Nations  Sustainable Development Goals (3) .\n\nThe  financial  characteristics  of  Sustainability-linked  bonds  are linked  to  three  performance  objectives  that  are  related  to sustainable  development.  These  objectives  are  presented below  along  with  their  2022  level  of  achievement  in  relation to the objectives for 2025.\n\n| Performance objectives                                                                                                                                      | 2022 Results                                                  | Details    | 2025 targets   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|\n| All L'Or\u00e9al operated sites will be 'carbon neutral' (4)  (Scopes 1 and 2)  by 31 December 2025 (1)                                                          | 65% (Scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites operated in tCO2e)    | See p. 173 | 100%           |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) on a 'cradle-to-shelf' scope  will be reduced by 14% per product sold by 2025 compared to the 2021  base year. | 488 (g of CO2 per product sold) i.e.  +9.42% compared to 2021 | See p. 199 | -14%           |\n| By 2025, 50% of the Group's plastic packaging will be recycled or bio-based.                                                                                | 26%                                                           | See p. 192 | 50%            |\n\n## 4.3.2. Human Resources Policy\n\nThe mission of L'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources Department (HR) is to support the Group's growth and its transformation initiatives. The  Group,  which  places  people  at  the  heart  of  its organisation,  relies  on  its  employees  above  all.  L'Or\u00e9al's  HR strategy  is  built  on  this  double  conviction:  individualised management linked with collective strength.\n\nTo meet the challenges of a world that is constantly changing, which  impact  both  the  organisation  and  relationships  with work, the Group initiated a process of transformation to adjust its  model  to  new  aspirations.  It  is  implementing  dedicated HR  policies  on  recruitment,  development  and  engagement. The  Chief  Human  Relations  Officer,  who  is  member  of  the Executive  Committee,  reports  directly  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer on a regular basis.\n\n## Recruiting, developing and engaging: putting employees at the centre of the business model\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  placed  the  individual  at  the  centre  of  its model,  convinced  that  the  qualities  of  each  one  contribute to the performance of all. L'Or\u00e9al finds, recruits, and supports its  employees  with  a  long-term  engagement  vision.  Training and  development  play  a  central  role  all  along  their professional  careers.  In  order  to  fully  perform  their  function as strategic partner, Human  Resources  integrates  the technological and digital dimensions and takes into account strong challenges such as social responsibility.\n\nHR plays a central role in the transformation of work methods and  management  culture.  Thus,  they  supported  the  rollout of  the Simplicity programme,  initiated  in  2016,  to  foster  a management style based on trust, leaving  room  to  initiative, cooperation and development. The programme was supported by  a  major  training  programme,  LeadEnable  for  Simplicity, and specific goals target the highest level of the Group.\n\nSince  2020,  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  their Management  Committees  have  been  evaluated  by  their peers and their teams via the Leadership Survey .\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the Disrupt HR approach, the Group is continuing to prioritise co-construction and a test-and-learn approach designed to boost agility and respond  more  effectively  to  the  expectations  of  employees and job candidates.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  growth  cannot  be  separated  from social progress. To support this conviction, the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme,  created  in  2013  and  deployed  in  all  our subsidiaries,  offers  employees  a  set  of  benefits  organised around  four  pillars:  welfare  schemes,  healthcare,  work/life balance  and  the  working  environment.  In  2021,  these  pillars were  updated  to  remain  relevant  and  to  meet  employees' needs and expectations at every key moment of their lives.\n\nEmphasis is  placed  on  both  physical  and  mental  health  and on new working methods. An extensive plan for the renovation of  working  spaces  allows  more  than  two-thirds  of  employees concerned to work in new or renovated offices and includes the means for hybrid working.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  providing  training  to  100%  of  its employees every year, worldwide, with the aim of maintaining their employability over the long-term.\n\nAs part of a responsible and innovative social policy, L'Or\u00e9al has also developed L'Or\u00e9al for Youth, a global programme to promote  the  employment  of  young  people,  which  provides them  with  professional  opportunities  for  work.  25,000  young people  benefited  from  this  in  2022.  Concrete  actions  were also taken to improve their employability.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  offers  its  employees  a  policy  of  sharing  its  growth. Profit-sharing programmes have been in place for many years everywhere  in  the  world.  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  an  employee  share ownership  plan  in  2018,  2020  and  2022.  Over  37,000  Group employees worldwide have been able to become shareholders in L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nQuality social dialogue is also one of the essential components of the L'Or\u00e9al model. It illustrates the Group's desire to involve employees and their representatives to its development.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  acts  with  the  conviction  that  a  policy  in  favour  of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) allows everyone, regardless of their background, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, age or disability, to give their best in the company. This is an essential driver of performance and innovation and is crucial  for  maintaining  sustainable  growth.  In  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al launched the L'Or\u00e9al For All Generations programme in France, which it aims to introduce internationally on gradual basis.\n\n| Policy                                                                                           | INDICATORS AND PRINCIPAL RESULTS                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Preserving employee health  and safety                                                           | Moving towards 'zero accidents' is the ambition that L'Or\u00e9al has set for itself.

Preserving employee health and safety\n\n## An ambitious shared health and safety policy\n\nThe Health (H) and Safety (S) policy is a main priority objective of the Group's general policy, and one of its main managerial pillars.  All  managers are evaluated on their ability to apply it, and on their results in this area. It is based on the fundamentals presented in section 4.3.1.1.1.\n\nMoving towards 'zero accidents' is the ambition that L'Or\u00e9al has  set  for  the  safety  of  its  employees.  The  Group  has implemented  programmes  aimed  at  reducing  risks  and ensuring regular improvement in results through the leadership of managers and the participation of staff at all levels.\n\nThe Group strives to ensure regulatory compliance with its own standards on its sites (industrial or administrative sites, research centres,  stores),  and  makes  sure  that  its  subcontractors  and suppliers  ensure  the  health  and  safety  of  people  through  a programme of external audits.\n\n118  injuries  with  lost-time  (L'Or\u00e9al  and  temporary  staff)  were reported  in  2022,  compared  with  128  injuries  with  lost-time in 2021.\n\nChange in Conventional Frequency Rate (TFc) (1)\n\n2.00\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe conventional frequency rate (TFc) is 0.62 and the enlarged total incident rate reported (TIRe) (2) is 1.34.

Definition  and  deployment  of  strategy  and  action  plans to  achieve the targets set: Conventional Frequency Rate (TFc) <0.5 for all Group sites;\n- 2. Commitment and visible participation by management;\n- 3. Initiatives  to  fight  the  most  frequent  incidents,  which include a global ergonomics programme and a specific LIFE programme  on  potentially serious accidents (see section 4.3.1.1.1.);\n- 4. Health and Safety organisation and practices in compliance  with  the  Group's  standards  with  ISO  45001 certification for all Operations sites;\n- 5. Specific training programme for managers, EHS managers, operators/technicians and for all employees;\n- 6.

A total of 58 awards were won.\n\n## 4.3.2.2. Recruiting and supporting talents\n\nThe Group is continually enriching and diversifying its  pool  of talent around the world to meet its present and future needs.\n\nThe  recruitment  teams  are  tasked  with  attracting  the  best talent in all countries in which L'Or\u00e9al Group operates, so as to form  diverse  teams  that  resemble  our  consumers  and integrate  all  cultures.  The  local  implementation  of  the recruitment  policy  is  carried  out  by  a  network  of  local recruitment experts covering all countries.\n\nTo  select  the  best  talents  capable  of  contributing  to  its transformation, L'Or\u00e9al recruits  on  the  basis  of  a  candidate's skills  and  potential.  The  Group  is  putting  in  place  innovative means to ensure its recruitment is more inclusive. The aim is to capitalise on candidates' strengths such as ambition, resilience, empathy, judgement, and learning agility.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique  know-how  in  working  with  higher education  to  identify  and  recruit  new  graduates.  The  Group relies on the following schemes, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Brandstorm, the Group's innovation competition for students.  In  2022,  this  competition  brought  together  more than  80,000  students  from  65  different  countries,  in  a completely  digital  format,  enabling  them  to  immerse themselves  in  the  beauty  industry  and  find  out  about  the Group's values of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n- \u00b7 the Management Trainee programme, a rotational programme that prepares new graduates for major business responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7 the  French  International  Business  Internship  ( Volontariat International en Entreprise ,  or  VIE)  scheme, which enabled more  than  100  young  Europeans  under  the  age  of  29 complete  an  internship  of  between  12  and  24  months  in 16 Group subsidiaries in 2022.\n\nThe  Group  is  continually  improving  its  powerful  digital communications  system  which  allows  to  enhance  the employer image, to share, daily and transparently, the richness of its jobs and the diversity of its career paths and to explain its culture.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Social  Media  strategy  in  recruitment  is considered  to  be  one  of  the  best  in  the  world.  A  strong presence  on  LinkedIn,  with  more  than  4.3  million  followers, helps with proactively recruiting the best talent.\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  ranked  by  Glassdoor as one of the best employers in France.\n\nAn  International  Digital  team  provides  L'Or\u00e9al  recruiters around the world with cutting edge digital tools to efficiently select  the  best  candidates  from  among  nearly  one  million applications  received.  These  solutions,  such  as  Seedlink  and Paradox,  use  artificial  intelligence,  which  provides  greater efficiency,  improves  the  candidate  experience  and  targets a broader diversity of backgrounds.\n\nIn  2022,  the  recruiter  community  came  together  to  consider several  topics,  such  as  training  to  combat  unconscious  bias, overhauling  training  programmes  for  new  recruiters  and compliance with GDPR requirements.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  strengthened  its  global  L'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth programme,  through  which  it  is  committed  to  creating 25,000 job opportunities per year for those under the age of 30. New initiatives  have  been  launched,  such  as  L'Or\u00e9al BOOST , which  gives  young  people  access  to  the  Coursera  training platform. Other mentoring and coaching initiatives have also been  launched  to  support  and  strengthen  the  employment prospects of young people all over the world.\n\nSuccessful integration of new employees lays the groundwork for  a  lasting,  quality  relationship  with  the  Company.  The FIT integration  programme  provides  everyone  with  the  keys  to success within the Group, both from an operational standpoint and in terms of sharing the corporate culture.\n\n## 4.3.2.3. Training and developing employees throughout their working life\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  considered  the  development  of  its employees as one of the main drivers of its performance and its transformation.  L'Or\u00e9al's  ambition  is  to  develop  the potential  and  employability  of  each  employee  throughout their lives, and to prepare tomorrow's leaders.\n\nThe  People  Development  &  Learning  teams  are  committed to  providing  the  most  relevant  and  modern  training  and development solutions throughout the world.\n\nThis  strategy  means  the  Group  is  recognised  as  a  centre of excellence  and  contributes  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  competitive advantage,  as  well  as  to  the  attraction,  engagement  and retention of employees.\n\nThis  is  reflected  by  the  fact  that  100%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  employees took part in a development opportunity in 2022 (1) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumber of training hours\n\n<!-- image -->",

Around 55,000 employees benefited from this in 2022. This intermingling of different people helps to form a common vision and shared practices within the organisation.\n\nAs  an  example  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  high  standards  of  excellence, in  2021  the  L'Or\u00e9al  University  of  Leadership  and  Culture obtained CLIP (2) accreditation from the EFMD (3) ,  the European standard for business schools, which remains valid until 2026.\n\nIn order to continue to nurture the Group's ambition to be the market's  number  one  Beauty  Tech,  the  University  of  Tech, Data  &  Analytics  launched  the Data4All programme  in  the second  half  of  2022.  The  purpose  of  this  new  programme, which  targets  more  than  20,000  employees,  is  to  create  a data-based  culture  within  the  company,  while  training participants in the main principles of working with data.\n\n## Training to secure essential skills\n\nL'Or\u00e9al equips all employees taking up new positions with JOB MUST (essential skills), to  enable  them to perform well in their role. More than 30,000 employees benefited from this in 2022.\n\nIn order  to  anticipate  these  critical  skills, the  Training Departments of the Divisions and Business Lines work in close collaboration with the Operational Departments. This planning work lays down roadmaps for developing skills in various areas of  expertise  and  identifies  the  most  appropriate  learning solutions to meet these needs. The Training Departments in the various Zones play a key role in implementing these solutions. Regional campuses are used to deploy the solutions in every country, and the Training Departments ensure that at least 80% of  relevant  employees  take  part  in  them  at  the  appropriate time  in  their  professional  career.  In  addition  to  developing these  business-line  specific  skills,  and  in  partnership  with theInternal  Control  Department,  the  training  teams  are responsible for rolling out 6 regulatory training courses (1) . These solutions  were  delivered  to  more  than  100,000  employees Group-wide in 2022.\n\nattitudes  etc.).  This  new  mix  of  online  and  off-line  learning offers greater opportunity for an excellent learning experience, as it can be adapted to regional themes and contexts. The level of excellence is measured by an impact score  that  consolidates  evaluations  completed  by  those participating in each training session. This score is of 80/100.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  Covid-19  crisis,  which  has  significantly changed  consumers'  purchasing  habits,  the  emphasis  since 2021  has  been  placed  more  firmly  on  e-commerce  and  the University  of  e-Commerce  was  founded.  It  is  intended  for  all employees and aims to support the Group's ambitions for this distribution channel. More than 15,000 employees have been upskilled in this area of expertise.\n\nSince  2014,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  deployed  a  comprehensive  Digital upskilling programme, which has already reached more than 65,000  employees.  Around  2,000  employees  have  also  been trained in the challenges of the Metaverse and Gaming, both vectors of engagement for consumers.\n\n## A new experience in individual development, boosted by state-of-the-art technology\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al implemented a process called CONNECT, which is  based  on  regular  'conversations',  to  completely  overhaul  its performance  evaluation  system.  These  conversations  bring employees  together  with  their  managers,  as  well  as  with  other internal stakeholders, to define their performance and development objectives.\n\nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  they  may  select  the  most appropriate  training  courses  from  over  20,000  available resources,  developed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  or  by  digital  content providers  such  as  LinkedIn  Learning,  TED,  Coursera  and Busuu.  These  conversations  provide  flexibility  as  they  can  be adjusted to suit each individual's operational reality. To  support  this  brand  new  development  experience,  L'Or\u00e9al has  implemented  specific CONNECT training  programmes, which benefited 36,000 employees in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Creating conditions for a stimulating and attractive work environment\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme: an accelerator of social progress\n\nThroughout its history, L'Or\u00e9al has aimed to offer its employees security  and  protection.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Share  &  Care  programme follows on from a long tradition of social progress and caring of  the  individual.  L'Or\u00e9al  makes,  and  will  continue  to  make, a difference by putting people at the centre of its concerns, its organisation and therefore its development.\n\nThe Group has set itself the goal of creating an attractive work environment  that  encourages  all  employees  to  thrive,  both professionally and personally.\n\nWith  its  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has universalised its social model in a manner that is consistent with its global  dimension.  This  strong  commitment  reflects  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompany's  vision  that  sustainable  growth  necessarily  goes hand-in-hand with a high level of social performance. L'Or\u00e9al launched and implemented L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care collaboratively  in  all  its  subsidiaries  in  2013,  and  renewed  the programme in 2017 and again in 2021. Its ambition is three-fold:\n\n- \u00b7 to have a common base of social protection with minimum guarantees in all subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 to  be  one  of  the  top  performers  in  each  market,  and  to adopt  local  best  practice  where  that  goes  beyond  the common base; and\n- \u00b7 to  make  each  subsidiary  a  'social  innovation  laboratory' by  encouraging  local  initiatives  that  are  in  line  with  their employees' expectations.\n\nThe  programme  is  constantly  adapted  to  reflect  global changes and keep up with the new demands of employees. Particular  attention  is  currently  paid  to  personal  ecology, with  mental  health  prevention  measures,  and  to  flexibility  in the workplace, with a global hybrid working policy.\n\nThe  core  elements  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care  have  now  been implemented in all subsidiaries. Furthermore, new elements will be implemented gradually between now and the end of 2023, in accordance with the priorities set by the programme.\n\n## The four pillars of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nThis  social  programme  revolves  around  four  pillars  that  were updated in 2021 and implemented in all countries:\n\n| Pillars                      | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Main commitments achieved or in progress in all countries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PROTECTION (Welfare schemes) | Providing employees and their  families with financial support in  the event of unexpected life events,  by allocating appropriate assistance.                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension, in the event of natural or accidental death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| HEALTH (Healthcare)          | Providing employees and their  relatives with access to a high-quality healthcare system as well as  prevention measures, placing  greater emphasis on mental  and emotional health, in order  to create a new global approach | 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension, in case of total permanent disability.

A  close collaboration  was  developed. L'Or\u00e9al is  a  founding  member of  the  Global  Business  Network  for  Social  Protection  Floor, which  was  launched  in  2015  by  the  ILO.  This  network  allows acting  collectively  and  mobilising  to  create  a  basic  set  of social protection measures for everyone.\n\n## Flexible work organisation\n\nIn  each  subsidiary,  work  is  organised  according  to  local context  and  to  the  activity  performed  in  compliance  with legal and contractual obligations. In several subsidiaries, both work  organisation  and  working  time  are  part  of  collective agreements.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  flexibility  at  work  is  a  key  element  in attractiveness. This flexibility is strengthened further by the new global  'Hybrid  Working'  policy.  Eligible  employees  may  work remotely for up to two days per week, on a voluntary basis, in agreement with the direct line manager and in keeping with the team's organisational structure. All Group subsidiaries have now  adopted  this  policy,  wherever  this  has  been  possible, given  the  local  health  situation.  In  addition,  58  subsidiaries have now set up a flexible working time policy.\n\nEmployees  from  all  categories  have  chosen  the  option  of part-time work. In 2022, there were 4,982 part-time employees, 4,468 of whom were women and 514 were men.\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al For All Generations programme\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  inclusion  of  more  experienced  employees  is  a long-standing  commitment.  Furthermore,  at  a  time  when careers  are  getting  longer  and  the  digital  transformation  is accelerating,  the  Group  has  launched  the  L'Or\u00e9al  For  All Generations  programme,  which  makes  intergenerational relationships a core objective. The programme aims to create an  attractive  working  environment,  encouraging  employees to flourish both professionally and personally from the moment they  join  the  company  until  they  retire.  The  programme focuses on five key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting intergenerational inclusion, equity and diversity;\n- \u00b7 adapting health and wellness programmes;\n- \u00b7 developing employability throughout the professional career;\n- \u00b7 preparing in advance for a successful transition to retirement; and\n- \u00b7 facilitating new life projects for the post-L'Or\u00e9al era.\n\nLaunched  in  France  in  2022  and  inspired  by  the  Spanish Generaciones initiative,  this  programme  will  gradually  be rolled  out  internationally,  and  subsidiaries  where  more  than 20% of employees are over 50 years of age will be prioritised.\n\n## An active social dialogue with employees and their representatives\n\nAs  a  signatory  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  since 2003,  and  in  compliance  with  its  Employee  Human  Rights Policy,  L'Or\u00e9al  respects  the  freedom  of  association  and  the right to collective bargaining.\n\nWhen  employees  wish  to  be  represented  by  authorised employee  representatives,  these  representatives  are  elected without company  interference. They have access to workplaces,  to  consenting  employees,  as  well  as  to  local documentation  useful  for  the  performance  of  their  duties, subject  to  compliance  with  Group's  legitimate  rules  on confidentiality  and  security.  In  countries  where  freedom  of association and the right to collective bargaining are restricted or non-existent, there are other modes of dialogue that enable employees to report any concerns they may have.\n\nIn the context of these general principles, the social climate at L'Or\u00e9al  is the fruit of an  ongoing  dialogue  between Management,  employees  and  their  representatives, in accordance with local trade union rights  and  with  a  neutral attitude with regard to the various trade union organisations.\n\nEmployee representation bodies are in place in most European subsidiaries,  in  several  Asian  subsidiaries (1) ,  in  Africa (2) ,  in  North and  South  America (3) ,  as  well  as  in  New  Zealand.  In  total, 86% of the Group's employees work in countries where there are  employee  representative  bodies  (at  one  of  the  sites  at least). 45% of the Group's employees are covered by  a  collective  agreement  and  97%  of  them  are  covered by company collective agreements.\n\nTwo Directors representing the employees have been member of L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors since 2014 (see section 2.2.1.3.).\n\nIn  1996,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  an  agreement  with  the  French  and European trade unions, which led to the establishment of the Instance Europ\u00e9enne de Dialogue Social ,  or  European  Works Council. This council represents more than 30,000 employees in 25  member  countries  of  the  European  Economic  Area  and the  United  Kingdom.  With  30  members,  this  council  holds regular  discussions  with  Management  about  the  Group's current  situation  and  its  future  perspectives,  on  the  basis  of an agenda prepared with the Liaison Secretariat.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, 204 agreements were signed in  France  and  94  agreements  were  signed  in  the  rest  of  the world.  In  total,  the  number  of  agreements  in  force  on 31  December  2022  was  772,  432  of  which  were  in  France and 121 of which wholly or partially involve health and safety issues.  These  agreements  primarily  cover  work  organisation, remuneration  and  working  conditions  (working  hours,  quality of  life  at  work,  professional  equality,  remote  working,  health and  safety,  etc.).  They  contribute  to  the  proper  functioning and  to  the  performance  of  the  Group  by  strengthening employee participation and dialogue with their representatives.\n\n## 4.3.2.5. Offering a motivating and competitive remuneration system\n\n## The principles of the remuneration policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's remuneration policy is an integral part of the Group's development  strategy.  L'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  attract  and  retain talents,  propose  motivating  career  paths  and  encourage performance  and  engagement  of  its  employees  while accompanying the evolution of its jobs and business.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  all  employees  receive  at  least  the minimum  salary  set  by  local  law  or  applicable  collective agreements.  In  most  of  the  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al's  lowest  base salaries  are  much  higher  than  the  national  minimum  wages in force.\n\n- A  remuneration  monitoring  process  is  in  place  to  adjust, if necessary,  the  remuneration  of  the  Group's  permanent employees  so  that  they  can  receive  a  living  wage,  which  is generally  higher  than  the  minimum  wage.  A  living  wage covers basic needs and is calculated in accordance with best practice  by  the  Fair  Wage  Network,  an  internationally recognised NGO.\n\nA total rewards approach is used to provide each employee with a competitive rewards package  including both compensation  elements  (fixed  pay,  variable  pay,  long-term incentives) and employee benefits.\n\nThe Group is implementing a remuneration policy that combines external  competitiveness  with  internal  equity.  This  rewards  both individual  and  collective  performance.  In  addition,  employees share  in  the  Company's  results  through  results-based  collective profit-sharing schemes rolled out globally.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al remuneration policy is formalised within a Rewards charter and is implemented by a network of Rewards experts present  in  the  different  countries.  External  surveys  are conducted every year with specialist firms to ensure L'Or\u00e9al's competitive  positioning  in  relation  to  each  local  reference market.\n\nThe  ambition  is  for  all  employees  to  understand  their remuneration and how it is determined. The Group makes sure that it communicates clearly and transparently on this subject.\n\nThe remuneration policy is supported by an annual employee performance  assessment  system  applied  in  all  subsidiaries.  It enables the communication of remuneration decision making principles, processes and outcomes. The Group is implementing a new HR information system that will enhance and update communications on this subject.\n\n## Personnel costs (including welfare contributions)\n\n| \u20ac millions   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total        | 6,124  | 6,471  | 7,264  |\n\nThe  comparison  between  the  three  years  takes  into  account  the  impacts  of foreign  exchange  and  is  not  representative  of  the  real  changes  in  personnel costs.\n\n## Employee shareholding plans\n\nKeen to share its growth with its employees, L'Or\u00e9al launched its  first  worldwide  employee  share  ownership  plan  in  2018. The  results  were  very  satisfactory.  L'Or\u00e9al  wanted  to  provide employees wishing to support the growth of the company and participate  in  its  strategic  plan  the  opportunity  to  do  so, by launching two new plans in 2020 and 2022. These plans are designed  to  gather,  unite  and  increase  the  loyalty  of employees  worldwide  by  enhancing  a  feeling  of  belonging, engagement and social cohesion.\n\nEligible employees had the possibility of purchasing shares with preferential  conditions  including,  where  permitted  by  local law,  a  20%  discount  on  the  share  reference  price,  with  an employer  matching  share  contribution  of  up  to  four  free shares.\n\nThe  plan  was  rolled  out  in  62  countries  in  2022,  seven  more than in 2020. It was a big success with a 35% subscription rate, similar  to  the  first  two  plans.  This  is  a  high  percentage compared  to  other  companies  that  have  set  up  employee shareholding plans . (1)\n\n## Plans for the conditional grant of shares to employees (ACAs)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  sets  up  long-term  incentive  plans  in  favour  of  its employees and corporate officers in an international context. These  take  the  form  of  grants  of  performance  shares.  These grants  serve  a  dual  purpose:  to  motivate  and  include  the major  contributors  in  the  Group's  future  successes,  and  to strengthen  the  commitment  and  feeling  of  belonging  of  its beneficiaries  by  fostering  long-term  loyalty  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nIn accordance  with  the  Group's  strategic objectives, the  choice  of  beneficiaries  and  the  vesting  criteria  are determined  by  a  specific  policy.  The  Board  of  Directors, subject to the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, approves the conditional grant of shares and lays down the applicable rules. The vesting of these shares is  subject  to  the  achievement  of  performance  targets and  the  beneficiary's  continued  presence  in  the  Company. Performance conditions include both financial and non-financial performance criteria (see section 7.4.).\n\n53%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  13  October  2022  plan  are women. More than 4,200 employees, representing approximately  10.5%  of  the  managers  around  the  world, nearly  58%  of  whom  are  in  international  subsidiaries,  benefit or  have  benefited  from  at  least  one  conditional  grant  of shares  plan  since  2017  and  were  still  employees  of  the\n\nCompany on 31 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "## L'Or\u00e9al Retention Plan\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al developed the L'Or\u00e9al Retention Plan, a new employee retention scheme. This new scheme targets young employees  who  are  not  yet  eligible  for  the  employee  share plans. It takes the form of a deferred bonus over three years. The  scheme is  implemented at country level. The first  edition of the scheme targets 1,000 beneficiaries in 35 countries.\n\n## Profit sharing schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  wishes  to  include  employees  in  the  results  of  the Company  with  the  aim  of  strengthening  their  feeling  of belonging and their motivation. In 2022, on the basis of its 2021 results,  the  Group  redistributed  \u20ac418  million  to  employees under  the  profit-sharing  schemes  in  place.  In  1968,  an employee  profit  sharing  agreement  ('participation')  was signed in France, followed by another agreement ('int\u00e9ressement')  in  1988,  and  these  agreements  have  been constantly  renewed  since  then. Since  2001,  L'Or\u00e9al  has implemented a Worldwide Profit Sharing Programme in all the Group's  subsidiaries  in  which  the  employees  do  not  benefit from legal or contractual profit sharing schemes. The amounts paid within this framework are calculated locally on the basis of  the  turnover  and  profit  of  each  subsidiary,  as  compared to the budgeted targets.\n\n| Amounts paid under these  programmes  (\u20ac millions)   |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total (1)                                            |    368 |    352 |    418 |\n\n## Employee benefit and pension schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  ensure  that  its  employees  benefit  from competitive  retirement  and  welfare  schemes  in  all  countries. Since  2002,  an  International  Benefits  Supervisory  Committee has  overviewed  the  management  of  these  schemes  in  the subsidiaries  and  monitored  the  implementation  of  L'Or\u00e9al's Retirement and Employee Benefits policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitments with regard to welfare schemes are part of the Protection pillar of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme. In  all  subsidiaries,  L'Or\u00e9al  guarantees  the  payment  of  a  lump sum, or equivalent pension, equal to a minimum of 24 months' salary in the event of death or total permanent disability, or a higher amount where it is the local practice.\n\nThe  characteristics  of  retirement  schemes  and  other  end  of career benefits offered by the subsidiaries vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations as well as local practices.\n\nIn  89%  of  the  countries  where  L'Or\u00e9al  employees  work,  the Group contributes to the build-up of supplemental retirement benefits for its employees in addition to the minimum benefits of the public social security system.\n\nRetirement  plans  are  financed  by  payments  into  specialised funds,  or  by  setting  up  provisions,  in  accordance  with  the accounting standards adopted by L'Or\u00e9al. The performance of the managers of the main investment funds, as well as the financial  stability  rating  of  the  custodians,  are  regularly reviewed by the International Benefits Supervisory Committee.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  does  not  propose  company  retirement  plans  in countries  that  do  not  have  an  appropriate  legal  framework, or  long-term  investment  instruments,  and  in  countries  where there  is  a  satisfactory  public  social  security  system.  The International Benefits Supervisory Committee remains attentive to  changes  to  local  situations  and,  when  needed  additional complementary schemes are put in place.\n\n## Overview of the pension and employee welfare schemes in France\n\nPension  schemes: To  supplement  the  pensions  provided  for by  the  compulsory  French  pension  scheme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has implemented some supplementary pension schemes described below.\n\nDefined  contribution  scheme :  In  September  2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  set up a 'defined contribution pension scheme'. After one year of employment, all categories of employees are beneficiaries of this  scheme,  which  is  financed  jointly  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the employee.  This  makes  it  possible  for  everyone  to  build  up retirement savings. This scheme entitles pensioners to a lifelong annuity  (or to a lump-sum,  under  certain  conditions), calculated  after  they  claim  their  pension  rights  under  the Social  Security  pension  system.  This  annuity  is  calculated  on the basis of the capital formed by the contributions paid and the financial income on such contributions at the end of the employee's  career,  as  well  as  the  annuity  option  selected. On 1 April 2021, the scheme was converted into a Mandatory Company Savings Plan (Plan d'\u00c9pargne Retraite Obligatoire PERO)  within  the  framework  laid  down  by  the  French  Pacte law  (Loi  Pacte).  This  made  it  possible  to  introduce  many improvements to the scheme, such as new options for paying into it, more diversified financial investments and more flexible exit conditions.\n\nDefined  benefit  schemes :  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  several  defined benefit schemes with unvested entitlements, that were initially differential  and  then  additive.    The  aim  was  to  take  into account  important  developments  impacting  these  schemes, with  the  aim  of  building  a  coherent  system  between  the different pension schemes that exist in the Company.\n\nFrench Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 no longer allows the acquisition  of  unvested  new  rights  in  schemes  open  on 20 May 2014 for employment periods after 31 December 2019. In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  froze  the  rights  at  31  December  2019. In 2021,  the  Group  finalised  the  establishment  of  two substitution  schemes with vested rights :  the  'Supplementary pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior  Managers  with  vested rights'  (Retraite  suppl\u00e9mentaire des Retrait\u00e9s Anciens Cadres Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis)  and  the  'Retirement  Income Guarantee  for  former  senior  managers  with  vested  rights' (Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis).  These  schemes  are  considered as  the  continuations  of  the  old  schemes  because  of  the consistency in terms of population and benefits. (2) (1)\n\nThe  'Supplementary  pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior Managers'  (Retraite  suppl\u00e9mentaire  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres Dirigeants) concerns retirees who have held positions as  senior  managers  for  a  minimum  of  10  years,  hired  or promoted  to  this  position  between  1  January  2016  and 4  July  2019,  who  end  their  career  in  the  Company.  This  is  an additive  defined  benefit  pension  scheme  which  grants entitlement to payment of a life annuity. The reference salary taken  into  account  for  calculation  of  the  pension  is  the fraction  of  the  salary  which  exceeds  six  times  the  French annual  Social  Security  ceiling.  The  calculation  base  of  the supplementary  pension  is  the  average  of  the  revalued reference salaries for the best three full years of activity out of the  seven  calendar  years  prior  to  the  end  of  their  career. The  supplementary  pension  is  1.36%  of  the  calculation  base per year of service within the Group until 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. Any retiree who so wishes could elect an option of a surviving spouse pension.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This scheme, created on 1 January 2001, was open to former senior  managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  who,  in  addition  to  fulfilling  the requirement of having ended their career with the Company, met the condition of having had the status of senior manager for  at  least  ten  years  at  the  end  of  their  career.  It  provides entitlement to payment to beneficiary retirees of a life annuity, as  well  as,  after  their  death,  the  payment,  subject  to conditions,  to  their  spouse  and/or  ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving spouse  pension  and,  to  the  children,  of  an  orphan  pension. The calculation base is the average of the salaries for the best three years out of the seven calendar years prior to the end of the senior manager's  career  at  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  income guarantee is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service in the Company up to 31 December 2019, up  to  a  limit  of  25  years.  The  amount  of  the  Guarantee  is progressively  and  regularly  increased  by  1.8%  each  year. The  pension  cannot  exceed  50%  of  the  calculation  base  or exceed  the  average  of  the  fixed  part  of  wages.  A  gross annuity  and  gross  lump  sum  equivalent  are  then  calculated, taking into account the sum of the annual pensions accrued by  beneficiaries  as  a  result  of  their  professional  activity  and assuming that their retirement age is 65. The life annuity is the result  of  the  conversion  into  an  annuity  at  the  beneficiaries' actual  age  on  the  date  they  apply  for  their  pension  of  the gross  lump  sum  equivalent,  less  the  amount  of  all  payments due  as  a  result  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract, excluding any paid notice period and paid holiday, and less all  salaries  paid  under  any  early  retirement  leave.  Around 330 senior managers are eligible for these schemes if they fulfil all conditions after ending their career with the Company.\n\nAccess to the 'Pension Cover for Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' was closed on 31 December 2000. This former scheme  granted  entitlement,  to  beneficiary  retirees  who ended their career with the Company, of a life annuity as well as, after their death, the payment under certain conditions to the spouse and/or ex-spouse(s) of a surviving spouse pension and,  to  the  children,  of  an  orphan  pension.  The  calculation base for the pension is the average of the salaries for the best three years out of the seven calendar years prior to the end of the beneficiary's career at L'Or\u00e9al. The pension is calculated on the basis of the beneficiary's number of years' service, with a  ceiling  of  40  years,  it  being  specified  that  at  the  date  of closure  of  the  scheme,  on  31  December  2000,  the  minimum length of service required was 10 years. The pension may not exceed 40% of the calculation base, plus 0.5% per year for the first  twenty  years,  then  1%  per  year  for  the  following  twenty years, nor exceed the average of the fixed part of the salaries. Around 120 senior managers (active or retired) are eligible for this  scheme  subject  to  the  requirement,  for  those  in  active employment,  that  they  fulfil  all  the  conditions  after  having ended their career with the Company. ( Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture )\n\nCollective  Retirement  Savings  plan  (PERCO) : Since  2003, L'Or\u00e9al  has  proposed  that  employees  make  savings  with  a view to their retirement within the scope of the PERCO. If the profit  sharing  is  placed  in  the  PERCO,  a  100%  matching contribution is paid by the Company on the first \u20ac1,200 gross and  50%  thereafter  (capped  at  \u20ac4,600/year  total  PERCO employer contributions). For employees who pay 100% of their profit  sharing  into  the  PERCO  for  five  consecutive  years,  an employer  contribution  of  \u20ac600  gross  is  paid  into  the  PERCO (Club  PERCO)  in  the  fifth  year.  Since  2021,  an  additional\n\nemployer contribution  of  \u20ac150  gross  has  been  paid  from  the sixth consecutive year in which 100% of the profit sharing has been  invested  into  the  PERCO.  Each  year,  employees  may also  transfer  10  days  of  saved  leave  time  (Compte  \u00c9pargne Temps,  or  CET)  in  the  PERCO.  An  additional  employer contribution of 20% is paid for these days.\n\nPre-retirement  arrangements : L'Or\u00e9al  pays  close  attention to its employees' retirement conditions. The existing arrangements are, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 early  retirement  leave  ('cong\u00e9  de  fin  de  carri\u00e8re',  CFC): this  early  retirement  arrangement  consists  of  exempting employees from the requirement to perform their activities, while  maintaining  their  remuneration  (up  to  a  limit  of \u20ac10,887  gross/month);  profit  sharing;  incentives;  and  paid leave.  The  CFC  may  range  from  3  months  for  20  years' seniority to 9 months for 30 years' seniority and more; and\n- \u00b7 retirement  compensation  ('indemnit\u00e9  de  d\u00e9part  \u00e0  la retraite', IDR): the scale set by collective agreement is more favourable than that of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries.  When  they  retire, employees may benefit from retirement indemnities ranging from  2  months'  salary  for  5  years'  service  to  8  months' salary for 40 years of service.\n\nIn  order  to  increase  the  special  leave  prior  to  retirement, employees may opt to convert all or part of their  retirement indemnities into time, or may choose to receive payment of all or  part  of  the  retirement  indemnities,  which  will  be  made at the time they leave the Company. These commitments are guaranteed  by  external  financial  cover  aimed  at  gradually building  up  funds  derived  from  premiums  paid  to  external organisations;\n\n- \u00b7 the  Time  Savings  Account  (CET):  this  optional  scheme enables  employees  to  plan  the  end  of  their  career  or increase their retirement income. Employees can bank up to 10 days of leave per year in the CET, five days of which attract  an  employer  contribution  of  25%  and/or  a  cash payment,  up  to  a  maximum  of  8%  of  gross  remuneration per year. This scheme is capped at 300 days.\n\nThe CET can finance a shift to part-time working from the age of 55, early retirement, increased retirement income, providing a retirement lump-sum , by taking the opportunity to transfer a  maximum of  10  days  per  year  to  the  defined  contribution scheme or the L'Or\u00e9al PERCO . (2) (1)\n\nEmployee  welfare  schemes  in  France : In  addition  to  the compulsory  guarantees  provided  for  by  the  collective bargaining agreements, L'Or\u00e9al has set up, in France, under an agreement, an Employee Welfare scheme providing  additional  collective  guarantees  to  its  employees. All  these  guarantees  are  based  on  gross  income  and  can total up to eight times the French annual social security ceiling. They  are  generally  financed  on  Brackets  A,  B,  and  C  of income, except for the Education Annuity which is based on Brackets  A  and  B,  and  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  which  is based  on  Brackets  B  and  C.  This  Employee  Welfare  scheme provides guarantees in the event of:\n\n- \u00b7 incapacity: to all employees, 90% of their gross remuneration  limited  to  eight  social  security  caps,  at  this level  net  of  charges,  after  the  first  90  days  of  work stoppage;\n- \u00b7 disability: to all employees, a fraction that depends on the level  of  disability,  rising  to  90%  of  their  gross  remuneration limited to eight social security caps, up to this amount net of charges;",

The amount of this Benefit is doubled in the event of accidental death,\n- \u00b7 for  the  employees  affiliated  with  the  benefit  scheme for  managers,  employees  governed  by  Article  36  of the  AGIRC  convention  and  sales  representatives,  the payment  of  a  Spouse  Pension  to  the  surviving  spouse. This  ensures  that  the  spouse  has  an  income  similar  to the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  paid  for  supplementary retirement  contributions  on  the  portion  of  remuneration greater  than  the  annual  cap  on  social  security  if  death had occurred at the age of 65, and\n- \u00b7 for all employees, the payment of an Education Annuity to  each  dependent  child,  according  to  an  age-based schedule.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  Lump  Sum  Equivalent  for  these guarantees may not exceed \u20ac2.3 million per event.\n\nMinimum  guaranteed  lump  sum  death  benefits: L'Or\u00e9al  has established  an  additional  guaranteed  Lump  Sum  Death Benefit that supplements, where applicable, for all employees, the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefit  in  an  amount  equal  to  three years'  average  income.  The  total  amount  of  the  risk  capital needed to fund the Surviving Spouse Pension and Education Annuity,  the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefits  and  the  minimum guaranteed Lump Sum Death Benefit is capped.\n\nHealthcare  expenses: the  healthcare  scheme  is  compulsory for  all  the  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its  French  subsidiaries. Employees have the option of including their family members in  these  schemes.  Contributions  are,  generally,  individual. The  contribution  by  the  employee  is  partly  financed  by  the Company.\n\n## 4.3.2.6. Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nDiversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  are  part  one  of  the  Group's strategic commitments, which aims to have teams that reflect the diversity of its consumers all over the world and to provide all  its  employees  with  an  equitable  and  inclusive  working environment.  The  Group  also  adopts  an  inclusive  approach towards communities, suppliers and stakeholders. The Group's DE&I strategy is built around four key pillars:\n\n- 1. Socio-economic  and  multicultural  background :  promote and  increase  the  diversity  of  socio-economic  and  cultural origins in the Group's teams;\n- 2. Disability : accelerate the inclusion of people with disabilities, by means of targeted actions, with a minimum target for the number of employees with disabilities in all countries;\n- 3. Age  and  Generations: value  and  take  into  consideration people of all ages and generations; encourage dialogue and cooperation  among  employees  of  different  generations; combat stereotypes based on age; and\n- 4. Gender and LGBTQIA+ :  achieve  gender  parity  at  all  levels and functions of the company; contribute to the establishment of  more  inclusive  environments  in  favour  of  the  LGBTQIA+ communities  everywhere  in  the  world;  act  against  any  type of harassment or violence, particularly sexism, sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\n\nThe  Group's  DE&I  policy  is  also  reflected  in  its  approach towards  its  suppliers  (see  section  4.3.3.6.),  its  consumers, partners, communities  and  the  NGOs  and  associations dedicated to inclusion in all Zones.\n\nTo  achieve  its  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  relies  particularly  on  an internal  network of 'DE&I Leads' in all of its entities. They are the guarantors of the Group DE&I policy, which they adapt to their  local  context.  The  Group  shares  its  achievements  and progress in a dedicated section on the loreal.com website. To measure employees' perception of DE&I, 'Pulse', the annual in-house survey on employee engagement, includes questions on this issue.\n\nIn advertising and marketing its products, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to communicating responsibly by ensuring that it respects the\n\ndiversity of beauty needs and desires around the world. In its Code of Ethics, the Group commits not to harm the dignity of human  beings  or  present  degrading  stereotypes  in  its advertising.  It  is  also  sensitive  to  possible  reactions  to  the Group's advertising from different religious,  ethnic,  cultural  or social groups.\n\nTo strengthen its commitment to more inclusive marketing and advertising,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  Unstereotype  Alliance  in  2021. As  a  member of the World Federation of Advertisers, in  2022 L'Or\u00e9al  contributed  to  the  publication  of  a  Charter  for Change, which aims to drive progress on DE&I issues within the advertising industry.\n\nThe  Global  DE&I  Advisory  Board,  brings  together  a  diverse group of external experts and leaders from within the Group. The Board is co-chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and the Global Chief DE&I Officer. It met three times in 2022, and local boards  also  met  in  North  America  and  the  United  Kingdom & Ireland.\n\n- In  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  the  Beauty  of  Inclusion  Awards, a  competition  to  recognise  the  best  DE&I  initiatives  led  by local teams. The 18 finalist projects, which came from all Zones, reflect  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  in  all  four  pillars  of  the  DE&I strategy.\n\n## Reinforcing multicultural and socio-economic diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's goal is to reflect, at all levels and in all functions, the diversity  of  the  markets  in  which  it  operates.  Particular attention is therefore paid to the diversification of recruitment pools,  to  ensure  equal  opportunities  in  terms  of  professional development,  and  to  raise  awareness  of  employees  and management  on  this  subject.  Under  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth programme, the Group is committed to diversifying its sources of  recruitment,  with  the  aim  of  recruiting  at  least  20%  of the  talent  for  the  Management  Trainee  Programme  from non-partner schools and universities.\n\n168: Number of nationalities (in the global workforce) distributed among the 68 countries (1)\n\n<!-- image -->",

L'Or\u00e9al  has signed  the  Charter  on  the  inclusion  of  refugees  and  exiled people in the workplace , drafted by SINGA and Utopies, as part of its commitment to professional integration and the fight against the underemployment of refugees.\n\n## Promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities\n\nFor more than 20 years, L'Or\u00e9al has applied a global policy to include  people  with  disabilities  within  the  Company.  In  2022, the Group  employed  1,625  statutory employees with disabilities,  i.e.  1.9%  of  the  total  workforce.  The  goal  is  2%  by 2025. The priorities for the disability pillar of the DE&I policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 recruitment:  promoting  the  recruitment  of  people  with disabilities in all countries;\n- \u00b7 retention:  supporting  employees  who  have  experencied accidents, illness or the worsening of an existing disability;\n- \u00b7 declaration of disability: promoting an inclusive environment and  creating  conditions  that  encourage  employees  to declare  their  disability,  so  that  the  company  can  adapt positions, jobs and support;\n- \u00b7 digital accessibility: any new digital platform must now meet this objective;\n- \u00b7 employee  awareness:  the  success  of  the  Disability  pillar  is closely linked to internal communication and training; and\n- \u00b7 partnerships  and  sharing  best  practice:  collaboration  with recognised experts, associations and NGOs on the subject, as  well  as  with  the  protected  and  disability-adapted  work sector is an important element in advancing inclusion.\n\nAn active member of the ILO since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the  first  signatories  of  the  Global  Business  and  Disability Network  Charter  in  2015  and  chaired  the  network  in  2021. Since 2020, L'Or\u00e9al has been a member of the Valuable 500, a  global  collective  of  500  companies,  whose  objective  is to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  support  the  Disability  Hub  Europe initiative, which brings together various stakeholders in the field of disability and sustainable development.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  strengthening  its  commitment  to  greater  inclusion in sport by supporting a group of sportspeople with disabilities.\n\n## Valuing and taking into consideration people of all ages and generations\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  ensures  that  every  employee  has  their  place  in  the company,  regardless  of  their  age  or  experience.  In  this context, in continuation of the Spanish Generaciones initiative and the French inter-company commitment to enhance the role  played  in  the  company  by  those  over  50  years  of  age, a dedicated international programme, named L'Or\u00e9al For All Generations, was launched in 2022 . (2)\n\n## Gender equity: professional parity and equality for women and men\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  most  strategic positions,  is  a  key  challenge  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  aim  is  to strengthen  the  Group's  ability  to  innovate  while  promoting a  culture  of  inclusion.  The  Group  ensures  that  all  jobs  are accessible  to  women  and  men,  both  at  the  level  of recruitment  and  with  regard  to  opportunities  for  career development.  Special  attention  is  given  to  pivotal  periods such as parenthood (see section 4.3.2.4.).\n\nThe policy on diversity  and gender balance deployed in the Group includes a goal to maintain,  every  year,  a  proportion of male or women employees that may not be less than 40% in strategic positions (around 300 positions). General Management reports annually to the Board of Directors on this policy  and  the  results  obtained  during  the  previous  financial year.  From  2022,  the  long-term  remuneration  plans  include criteria  for  non-financial  performance  in  addition  to  financial performance,  one  of  which  is  a  criterion  linked  to  gender balance in strategic positions.\n\nSince  March  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  published  its  'Index  of Professional  Gender  Equality',  which  is  calculated  using  five indicators  defined  by  the  'Professional  Future'  law.  This  2023 Group Index is at 97% for all of L'Or\u00e9al's French entities.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  collaborated  with  the  INED  (National Institute  for  Demographic  Studies)  to  conduct  an  annual analysis  of  the  differences  in  remuneration  between  women and men working in  France.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  equal  pay among  those  with  the  same  level  of  skills  and  the  same classification.  The  median  pay  gap  in  France  decreased from 10% in 2007 to 0% in 2019 (stable in 2020 and 2021) and the  average  (mean)  pay  gap  in  France  also  fell  during  this period, from 31% in 2007 to 10% in 2021 (3) .\n\nIn  addition  to  the  INED  analysis  in  France,  in  2020  L'Or\u00e9al launched  a  global  tool  to  measure  gender  pay  equality 'all  things  being equal' (net of structural effects) certified by EDGE,  which  applies  a  tolerance  threshold  of  +/-5%.  The analysis  was  extended  to  32  countries (4) in  2022,  representing more  than  85%  of  the  global  workforce  (compared  to 28 countries in 2021). L'Or\u00e9al aims to expand the scope of this analysis to all the countries in which the Group has more than 150  employees  by  2025.  According  to  this  analysis,  the adjusted  average  salary  gap  in  these  countries  is  0.90%  in favour of men.\n\nIn  addition to the EDGE methodology, L'Or\u00e9al is deploying a Gender  Pay  module  in  the  HR  information  system,  which enables  each  country  to  monitor,  analyse  and  improve  its gender pay statistics.",

The  Group's head  office  in  France  and  25  of  its  countries have  been awarded the GEEIS label \u2611 ,  and are audited every two years by Bureau Veritas to measure the progress achieved. (4)\n\nEight other countries currently rely on the EDGE certification process \u2611 . The  countries  are  audited  by  the  third-party organisations Flocert or Intertek in order to be certified. L'Or\u00e9al Brazil  has  achieved  EDGE  Lead  status,  the  highest  level  of EDGE  certification.  L'Or\u00e9al  USA  and  L'Or\u00e9al  Canada  have achieved  EDGE  Plus  status,  which  provides  an  additional analysis  in  terms  of  intersectional  equality  (gender  identity, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, disability and nationality). (5)\n\nIn  total,  33  countries continued to be EDGE or GEEIS certified in  2022  (compared  with  31  countries  in  2021) \u2611 , which represents more than 60% of the Group's workforce.\n\nIn  2022,  an  initiative  from  L'Or\u00e9al  Pakistan  was  awarded  a GEEIS-SDG trophy in the third edition of the awards, organised by Arborus under the patronage of the Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations.\n\nIn another area, L'Or\u00e9al has conducted a pioneering initiative designed to promote gender equality in the legal profession. A Charter has been drawn up and put forward to our principal law firms. At the end of 2022, 14 firms had signed this Charter, which supplements any action taken in this area by the firms themselves.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al is committed to combating gender-based violence\n\nIn 2018, L'Or\u00e9al was the first company to join the One in Three Women  network,  the  first  European  network  of  companies committed to fighting violence against women . Its aim is to create and test measures to combat violence against women and to support the employees concerned, through specialised (6)\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n- \u00b7 7% of all key positions within the Group including: (2)\n- \u00b7 48% of strategic positions ; (3)\n- \u00b7 53% of other key positions monitored at Group level;\n- \u00b7 59% of key positions monitored at local/regional level;\n- \u00b7 32% of Executive Committee members; and\n- \u00b7 50% of members of the Board of Directors.\n\nNGOs. With this network, concrete actions were taken in 2022, such as:\n\n- \u25cf the  provision  of  online  training  (translated  into  seven languages)  to  raise  employee  awareness  of  violence against women;\n- \u25cf the  launch  of  an  awareness-raising  advertising  campaign, to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nAfter having committed to support the ILO's adoption of the first international convention against violence and harassment in  the  workplace  in  2019  along  with  the NGO CARE ,  L'Or\u00e9al established  a  global  HR  policy  on  combatting  domestic violence. This policy was launched in March 2021 in the new version of Share & Care, with the aim of implementing a local policy in all subsidiaries in the Group.\n\nIn  2018,  the  #StOpE  initiative  against  so-called  'ordinary' sexism  in  the  workplace,  led  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  teams  in  France with  AccorHotels  and  EY,  brought  together  30  companies and  organisations.  They  signed  a  commitment  under  the patronage  of  the  French  Minister  for  Gender  Equality and  the  Fight  Against  Discrimination.  Today,  more  than 190 organisations are involved with this initiative, which aims to promote  best  practices  to  combat  sexism  in  the  workplace. This  initiative  is  deployed  globally  within  the  Group.  Online training has been developed collaboratively by seven of the companies in the network.\n\n## Contributing to the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the LGBTQIA+ communities\n\nWith  a  presence  in  all  Zones,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  contributing  to  the establishment  of  more  inclusive  environments  in  favour  of people  identifying  as  LGBTQIA+ .  Since  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has been  one  of  the  sponsors  of  the  'Standards  of  Conduct for Business' established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human  Rights in the fight against discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people.

This  policy has  been  incorporated  into  the  Share  &  Care  programme since 2021.\n\nThe  Employee  Human  Rights  Policy  sets  out  the  Group's commitment  to  combating  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of gender identity or sexual orientation. Once again, L'Or\u00e9al USA received  the  maximum  score  of  100  on  the  2022  Corporate Equality Index of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.\n\n## Training employees in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nIn order to support these initiatives, L'Or\u00e9al trains its employees in DE&I by organising Diversity Training Workshops. This training is  now available virtually. In 2022, more than 5,000 employees were trained through these workshops.\n\nSince 2010, L'Or\u00e9al has participated in the EVE programme, an initiative led by the Danone Group, aimed to help women to be agents of change in their company and to develop their leadership  and  careers.  Editions  of  this  programme  were launched in Asia in 2014 (EVE Asia-Pacific) and in Africa in 2017 (EVE  Africa).  In  2022,  105  Group  employees  took  part  in  this programme.\n\n## 4.3.3. Human rights policy\n\n## 4.3.3.1. A commitment of the entire organisation\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment to Human Rights is based in particular on  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the  Fundamental  Conventions  of  the  International  Labour Organisation.\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  a  member  of  the Executive Committee, is responsible for overseeing the respect of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms in the Group. This mission has been entrusted to her by L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer,  to  whom  she  reports.  She  chairs  the  Group's  Human Rights Committee. She relies on a dedicated team of Human Rights experts and has a budget to carry out her work.\n\nThe Group's Human Rights commitments are rolled out across all markets through a network of Human Rights Correspondents.\n\nMore  than  80  DE&I  learning  resources  are  now  available  on the  Group's  internal  training  platform.  In  2022,  the  Group made  available  13  online  training  courses  on  DE&I  topic , as  well  as  quarterly  online  conferences  and  a  selection  of podcasts. L'Or\u00e9al also supports Octave, an intergenerational leadership  programme  launched  more  than  ten  years  ago by Danone. (1)\n\nIn 2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  in-house  training  in  inclusive leadership  within  the  Consumer  Products  Division,  training more than 140 Human Resources Directors, Diversity Leads and managers  in  2022.  The  course  is  being  rolled  out  within  the Luxe Division, and the aim is to roll it out to all Divisions during the course of the year.\n\n## Awards obtained in 2022\n\nFor  the  fifth  consecutive  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  by Bloomberg's  Gender-Equality  Index  2022  (GEI)   for  its commitments  to  female  leadership,  talent  management, gender equality, inclusion, and policies on sexual harassment. (2)\n\nFor the seventh consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the top 100 companies in the Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index 2022. (3)\n\nFor the fifth consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the top 20 most  advanced  companies  in  the  world  in  terms  of  gender equality,  according  to  the  Equileap  Global  Gender-Equality Ranking 2022 . (4)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Human Rights Committee is composed of representatives from the various Zones, activities and departments (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security, etc.). It is responsible  for  coordination  and  exchange  on  the implementation of the Group's Human Rights policy. Its primary objective  is  to  facilitate  the  emergence  of  a  Human  Rights culture within the Group.\n\nIn  order  to  best  address  the  Human  Rights  issues  that  relate to  its  operational  activities  and  commercial  relationships, L'Or\u00e9al  has  structured  its  Human  Rights  policy  around 4 stakeholder groups that are potentially affected: (i) employees,  (ii)  employees  of  the  Group's  suppliers, (iii) consumers, and (iv) communities.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve its Human Rights goals and face the risks that have been identified, L'Or\u00e9al has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003, and is committed to  respecting  all  internationally  recognised  Human  Rights. This commitment is supported each year at the highest level of the company by its Chief Executive Officer and by the Chief Sustainability Officer.\n\nAware of the scale of the challenge throughout its entire value chain,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  ambitious  goals  in  respect  of Human  Rights,  through  the  various internal or public documents described below.",

L'Or\u00e9al's commitment to protecting personal data\n\nThe  Group  attaches  great  importance  to  the  principle  of transparency and aims to establish a relationship of trust with its  stakeholders. It  ensures  that  its  responsible  use  of  personal data  is  underpinned  by  the  protection  and  security  of  that data.\n\nIn  support  of  this  ambition,  the  Group's  principles  governing the  processing  of  personal  data  (data  privacy)  have  been shared  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees about respect for ethical principles and the legal and regulatory requirements in this area. These principles are supplemented  by  a  framework  of  policies,  procedures  and operational guidelines.\n\nThe  Group  has  put  in  place  a  structure  based  on  a  Data Privacy Office (Global DPO Office) ,  which consists of a Legal unit  and a Programme unit. A Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) was appointed in 2018 and a network of Country DPOs has been set up worldwide and is growing in strength (44 DPOs in  2022).  This  structure  also  relies  on  a  network  of  Heads  of Personal Data Protection in each region and in each business area (IT, Digital, Marketing, HR, Research & Innovation, Retail, Operations,  etc.).  They  are  responsible  for  defining  and deploying personal data protection policies that are tailored to the challenges and specific features of their fields.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Led  by  the  Group  DPO, this Committee is composed specifically of the Chief Financial Officer,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer,  the Group  General  Counsel  and  the  Chief  Information  Officer. For  the  sake  of  consistency  and  operational  efficiency,  a Steering Committee is in place for each Zone.\n\nThis governance  ensures  the  Group's  compliance  with different  laws,  such  as  the  GDPR  in  Europe,  the  CCPA  in California, the LGPD in Brazil, the PIPL in China or the POPI Act in  South  Africa.  It  ensures  stakeholder  involvement  and  that client, supplier  and  business  processes  are  adapted  to applicable local laws.\n\nIn  order  to  comply  with  European  rules,  the  Group  has established a record of data processing performed in Europe. This  tool  is  also  offered  in  countries  not  subject  to  the  GDPR that wish to use it.\n\nIn  support  of  the  privacy  by  design  principle,  the  Group  has deployed  a  digitalised  tool  that  is  available  to  operational\n\nstaff.  This  tool  helps  them  to  ensure  that  a  project  complies with operational principles and rules relating to personal data protection  from  the  very  start  and  to  carry  out  the  required privacy impact assessments.\n\nAll employees  within  the  Group  have  access  to  an awareness-raising  programme  on  the  protection  of  personal data. Specific training is available for the main business lines. An  Intranet  site  dedicated  to  this  subject  can  be  accessed at any time by all employees worldwide.\n\nThe  Group  Internal  Control  organises  annual  self-assessment of  the  implementation  of  the  personal  data  protection compliance programme for all countries and business lines.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Group's  digital  activities,  the  Internal  Audit Department conducts audit checks on the protection of the personal data of consumers.\n\nSince  2019,  a  specific  audit  programme  on  personal  data protection has been aimed at all European countries that are subject  to  GDPR,  which  has  been  conducted  by  an independent auditor.\n\n## 4.3.3.3.

BFBL provides vocational trainging on beauty skills  for  people  in  vulnerable  situations.  As  this  training  is  professional,  L'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  it  promotes  and  contributes  to  access  to  employment.  Solidarity Sourcing is a programme that encourages L'Or\u00e9al suppliers to directly employ workers from socially or economically vulnerable communities.\n\n## Measures taken in favour of communities\n\nThroughout  the  production  chain : The  environmental  risks related to L'Or\u00e9al's sites and activities may potentially have an impact  on  the  local  communities  in  which  the  Group operates. In this area, L'Or\u00e9al has a long-standing commitment to managing risks and reducing its environmental footprint,  and  is  implementing  an  ambitious  policy  described in detail in section 4.3.1.\n\nA  responsible  approach  to  property  assets :  For  prospective acquisitions of premises or building land, L'Or\u00e9al ensures that the  former  owners  and/or  occupiers  have  not  been  unfairly removed and/or that any expropriation by the authorities was conducted in accordance with international law, namely with the free agreement and compensation of the previous owners and/or occupants.\n\nResponsible sourcing : See section 4.3.1.3.\n\nSolidarity  Sourcing:  using  the  Group's  purchasing  power  to serve social inclusion : Through the Solidarity Sourcing programme,  launched  in  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  numerous local projects in favour of local communities. It aims to use the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion. A  proportion  of  its  purchases  are  dedicated  to  suppliers providing access to work and a sustainable income for people who  are  generally  excluded  from  the  labour  market, economically vulnerable communities, including small businesses and those that truggle to access major contractors. The programme concerns all the Group's suppliers and values their  commitment to  DE&I  issues.  It  involves,  for  example,  fair trade  producers,  companies  which  employ  people  with disabilities,  social  inclusion  companies,  or  companies  owned by  minorities (1) ,  where  national  legislation  permits. Solidarity Sourcing offers  a  novel  sourcing  approach  due  to  its  global, holistic  nature.  Rolled  out  in  all  Zones,  it  concerns  all  fields  of purchasing (2) . Its ambition is to associate economic\n\nL'Or\u00e9al wants to carry this goal beyond the Group. This is why the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  includes  a  new demanding  commitment  ensuring  that  all  employees  of strategic  suppliers  are  paid  at  least  the  level  of  a  'living' wage. Calculated by region and aligned with the best local practices,  these  new  standards  must  allow  employees  to cover  their  basic  needs  and  those  of  their  family  for  decent housing,  food,  education  and  any  other  needs.  In  many countries, this 'living' wage goes beyond the legal minimums.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Solidarity  Sourcing  today  has 401  projects  up  and  running  in  886  local  initiatives  (including an additional 214 initiatives launched in 2022) in 70 countries, with the support of 84 third parties.\n\n## Focus on the Group's Inclusive sourcing in France\n\n80  projects  of  the  global Solidarity  Sourcing programme support  employment  in  France  (1  in  5  projects),  deployed  in 129 local initiatives. France is the country that undertakes the highest  number  of  Solidarity  Sourcing  projects.  In  2022, solidarity purchases in France represented 2,890 full-time jobs, an increase of 15% compared to 2020, representing 381 jobs.\n\nThese  projects  cover  a  wide  range  of  purchases,  including: cardboard,  glass  and  plastic  packaging,  POS  advertising materials, services, filling and packing, and logistics.\n\n- \u00b7 21% of the beneficiaries are people with disabilities (615 jobs);\n- \u00b7 nearly  half  of  the  beneficiaries  are  in  zones  classified  as vulnerable (1,339 jobs). These are areas classified as 'Rural Revitalisation  Zones'  and  'Sensitive  Urban  Zones'.  These jobs cover production needs (glass bottles, tubes, cardboard  boxes,  subcontracting)  or  services  related  to L'Or\u00e9al's business;\n- \u00b7 other Solidarity Sourcing projects in France mainly concern support  for  Living  Heritage  Enterprises  (EPV),  SMEs,  older workers facing hiring discrimination, women entrepreneurs, women  who  are  victims  of  domestic  violence,  people  in inclusion, and bio-solidarity cooperatives.\n\nCitizen Day - a day of employee involvement : every year since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al employees dedicate a day of their working time by providing their skills and devoting their energy to hundreds of  social  and  environmental  non-profit  organisations.  This involves, for example,  cleaning  natural  sites,  setting  up well-being  workshops  for  people  in  vulnerable  situations, repainting  centers  for  elder  people,  etc.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  also developed the L'Or\u00e9al Citizen (1) program, offering its employees the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  different  causes  through several  ways,  such  as  Payroll  Giving,  Hackathons  for  good, crowdfunding campaigns, and mentorship.\n\nBeauty for  a  Better  Life  -  a  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  programme  for vulnerable people :  Convinced that beauty contributes to the process of rebuilding oneself, the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al, through its Beauty  For  a  Better  Life  programme,  assists  fragile  people in  improving  their  self-esteem  by  giving  them  access  to  free beauty  and  well-being  care.  The  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  also promotes employment  for vulnerable women  through excellence training programmes in the beauty professions.\n\n## Beauty care and well-being treatments\n\nThe  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  the  provision  of  free  beauty care  and  well-being  treatments  in  medical  and  social environments  through  the  partnerships  it  has  built  with non-profit  and  hospital  organisations.  These  treatments  are provided by specially trained socio-beauticians or socio-hairdressers.  They  play  a  role  in  improving  well-being, self-esteem,  fighting  spirit  and  social  cohesion.  They  offer essential  moments,  whether  for  patients  whose  bodies  are ravaged by illness or for people in a fragile social situation.\n\nIn 2022, the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al made it possible for more than 15,500  people  in  difficult  circumstances  to  receive  beauty care and wellbeing treatments in France. By increasing access\n\nto these treatments, the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al is also encouraging social innovation:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  continued  the  mobile  beauty  and well-being  salon  initiative  that  it  launched  in  2019,  in  the \u00cele-de-France, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and Provence-AlpesC\u00f4te d'Azur regions of France. More than 500 vulnerable or isolated women  have  benefited  from  socio-beauty treatments;\n- \u00b7 in partnership with Emma\u00fcs Solidarit\u00e9, another beauty and well-being  space  has  been  specifically  dedicated  to vulnerable  people  to  give  them  no-cost  access  to socio-beauty  and  socio-hairdressing  services  within  a welcoming space.\n\n## Training in the beauty professions\n\nIn  partnership  with  local  NGOs  in  nearly  27  countries,  the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al offers free training on beauty  skills (hairdressing  and  makeup)  to  women  in  very  difficult  social or economic situations to assist them in finding employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, as part of the Beauty For a Better Life programme,\n\n7 430 people in very difficult social or economic situations were trained in Beauty professions.\n\nThe  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  partners  with  M\u00e9decins  du  Monde  for the  benefit  of  women  and  children :  The  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al supports  the  M\u00e9decins  du  Monde  (Doctors  of  the  World) association's facial reconstructive surgery operations ('Op\u00e9ration  Sourire\").  The  Fondation  L'Or\u00e9al  enables  children or  women  who  suffer  from  congenital  malformations  or  who are  victims  of  physical  violence  to  regain  their  integrity  and return to their community.\n\n## 4.3.3.7. Measures for the promotion of women's rights\n\nAs  an  active  supporter  of  the  UN  Women's  Empowerment Principles, the Group is involved in numerous initiatives aimed not  only  at  improving  the  situation  of  women  in  the  private and  public  spheres,  but  also  at  recognising  the  contribution of women to the advancement of humanity.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.1. Responsible communication\n\nThe Group's Code of Ethics and the principles of Responsible Communication,  which  are  summarised  in  an  operational brochure distributed worldwide, cover namely the prohibition of stereotypes and degrading images of women.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.2. Gender equality\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  highest  levels  of responsibility,  is  a  key  challenge  for  the  Group,  both  to promote a culture of inclusion and to increase L'Or\u00e9al's ability to  innovate.  The  Group,  therefore,  ensures  that  all  jobs  are equally  accessible  to  women  and  men,  both  at  the  level  of recruitment and with regard to career development. Special attention is given to pivotal periods such as parenthood (see section  4.3.2.6.).  During  supplier  audits,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  seeks  to ensure the absence of discrimination and sexual harassment.",

        "page_content": "Policies, performance indicators and results\n\n## 4.3.3.7.3. For Women in Science: a programme of the Fondation L'Or\u00e9al\n\nSince  1998,  the  L'Or\u00e9al-Unesco  For  Women  in  Science programme  works  to  accelerate  the  careers  of  female scientists and fight the obstacles they encounter so that they can contribute to solving the great challenges of our time for the benefit of all.\n\nTo  date,  the  International  'L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO  For  Women  in Science'  Awards  has  honoured  127  women,  distinguished for  their  careers  and  the  excellence  of  their  scientific  work. They  include  Professors  Elizabeth  H.  Blackburn,  Ada  Yonath, Emmanuelle  Charpentier  and  Jennifer  Doudna,  all  of  whom received  a  Nobel  Prize  after  winning  the  International  Prize. Each  year,  the  programme  also  recognises  more  than 250 young talented scientists at doctoral or post-doctoral level in over 110 countries.\n\nTo support these scientific women even further, and to allow them  to  break  the  glass  ceiling  more  easily,  the  Fondation L'Or\u00e9al has made a commitment to train them in skills to which they  generally  do  not  have  access  during  their  academic courses  (such  as  personnel  development,  management, communication, negotiation, gender bias).\n\nThis  year,  the  For  Girls  in  Science  program  was  deployed nationaly. This program launched in 2016, in 6 cities in France with  150  high  school  girls  aims  to  encourage  them  to  pursue scientific vocations. Through academic  support, inspiring meetings with women scientists, orientation workshops, scientific challenges and stays, the participants of the program discover together how  science, in particular STEM -Science, Technology,  Engineering,  Mathematics  -  have  an  impact  on society and in our lives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.3.7.4. The L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women: a charitable fund to support women in extremely vulnerable situations throughout the world.\n\nThe crisis triggered by  the  Covid-19  health  crisis has exacerbated  many  inequalities,  with  particularly  devastating effects  for  those  who  were  already  struggling  socially  or economically  or  were  victims  of  abuse,  where  women  are at the top of the list.\n\nAs  a  long-term  supporter  of  women's  rights,  in  2020  L'Or\u00e9al launched  a  \u20ac50  million  charitable  endowment  fund  as  part of  its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme.  This  fund  aims  to\n\nsupport local organisations on the field in their efforts to assist women  in  extremely  vulnerable  situations,  prevent  domestic and sexual violence and support victims. Particular attention is paid to projects aimed at helping women who are vulnerable on  a  number  of  fronts,  particularly  refugees  or  women  with disabilities.  Beyond  emergency  relief  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for Women  wants  to  make  a  proactive  contribution  to  the resilience  of  women  and  girls,  by  supporting  social  and professional  integration  projects  and  breaking  down  the barriers to education. Since it was launched, the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women has supported more than 240 organisations around the world, which  support  more  than  1,230,000  direct beneficiaries.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.5. Brand programmes: examples\n\nAlongside  the  NGO  Care,  Lanc\u00f4me  has  been  taking  part  in Write  your  Future,  an  international  programme  aimed  at fighting  illiteracy among  girls,  since  2017.  In  2022,  the programme had more than 77,000 beneficiaries (1) .\n\nOver  the  past  14  years,  the  Helena  Rubinstein  brand  has supported  women  who  want  to  become  entrepreneurs. In 2022, with the assistance of its partner NGO Forces Femmes, it supported 283 women (1) .\n\n## 4.3.3.7.6. Responsible and inclusive purchasing\n\nOver 60% of the beneficiaries of the Group's Solidarity Sourcing programme  are  women  (see  section  4.3.3.6.).  A  total  of 42,543  beneficiaries  come  from  83  projects  -  encompassing 180 local initiatives - specifically related to the emancipation of women in 39 countries, with the support of 22 associations and NGO partners. These projects support:\n\n- \u00b7 women producers of raw materials such as shea, centella, argan,  babacu  or  galanga  collected  and  harvested  in accordance with fair trade principles;\n- \u00b7 women from various vulnerable local communities, or who have assumed positions usually held by men;\n- \u00b7 beneficiaries through support for women-owned businesses (suppliers  owned,  controlled  and  led  by  51%  or  more women).  In  2022,  the  Group  continued  to  accelerate  its strategy  to  support  female  entrepreneurship,  reconfirming its  commitment  in WEConnect  International (2) . Since  2020, the Group has increased sevenfold the number of jobs with suppliers  owned,  controlled  and  managed  by  women: 4,522 jobs in 27 countries. This strategy, initiated many years ago in  the  United  States  through  the  partnership  with  The Women's  Business  Enterprise  National  Council,  is  being deployed and accelerated worldwide;\n- \u00b7 single mothers (704 single mothers in Latin America);\n- \u00b7 military wives; and\n- \u00b7 women victims of violence.\n\nIn addition to agriculture, these projects concern a broad range of manufacturing activities and services: production, assembly, logistics, sales, marketing, or digital business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It applies to all employees, directors and corporate  officers  and  members  of  the  Executive  and Management  Committees  of  the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries worldwide.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Code  of  Ethics  was  updated  in  2014. Available  in  45  languages,  and  in  French  and  English  Braille, it is distributed to all employees worldwide.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  also  published  a  more  detailed  corruption prevention policy that is available on its website, loreal.com.\n\nWith regard to employees, the Group also has other reference documents for the purpose of specifying the practices to be adopted and preventing corruption.\n\n- \u00b7 Specific Corruption Prevention Guide : rolled out throughout the  Group  as  a  whole  since  2013  and  complemented  in 2018,  it  covers  the  relationships  with  each  of  L'Or\u00e9al's stakeholders,  in  particular  with  the  public  authorities  and intermediaries.

Tax policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al considers that taxation is an integral part of its social, environmental  and  societal  responsibility  and  constitutes  a way  to  participate  positively  to  the  development  of  the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Group's  tax  policy  forms  part  of  the  sustainable development of its business. It is based on three pillars, which are  defined  in  the  Internal  Tax  Charter  prepared  and distributed around the world: Compliance, Transparency and Legitimacy.\n\n## Compliance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al completes its tax declarations and pays its taxes by the deadlines in compliance with the laws and regulations in the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nSpecial  vigilance  is  required  on  compliance  with  the  rules related to the fight against tax fraud and tax avoidance.\n\nIn  2022, L'Or\u00e9al has strengthened the distribution of roles and responsibilities  of  tax  and  accounting  functions  and  their interactions, in order  to  harmonise  the  standards  and processes that relate to tax compliance by the Group.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  located  in  countries  where  it  conducts  a  real operational  and  commercial  activity.  If  applicable,  the Group's presence in certain so-called 'tax haven' countries is justified  for  operational  reasons  and  the  development  of  its activity, and not for tax purposes.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al ensures that transactions between Group companies are carried out in compliance with the arm's length principle defined  by  the  OECD  and  the  UN  and  satisfies  increasingly digitalised reporting obligations (transfer pricing documentation, country-by-country reporting, etc.).\n\nIn view of the OECD reform that provides for a minimum level of  taxation  of  15%  in  each  country  (Pillar  2),  L'Or\u00e9al  is preparing to adapt its information systems in order to comply with this future regulation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al aims for excellence in tax compliance.\n\n## Transparency\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  establishes  and  maintains  relations  with  Tax  and Customs  Authorities  based  on  transparency,  pursuant  to  the Group's 'zero tolerance' rule on corruption.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also develops a constructive relationship with Tax and Customs Authorities, a relationship based on the principles of co-operation and mutual respect. L'Or\u00e9al responds appropriately and promptly to requests from the tax authorities regarding  the  exchange  of  information,  in  compliance  with tax conventions.\n\nWhere permitted  to  do  so  by  governments,  L'Or\u00e9al  joins  the cooperative  compliance  programmes  launched  by  the  tax authorities.  For  example,  the  trust  relationship  (' relation  de confiance ') with the French tax authorities.\n\nThe  Group  may  contribute  to  the  analysis  of  legislative changes  at  the  request  of  Tax  and  Customs  Authorities  or professional  associations  involved.  Consequently,  the  Group takes part in OECD working groups relating to Pillars 1 and 2.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  takes  into  consideration  global  challenges  and standards  in  terms  of  tax  transparency.  In  particular,  it adheres  to  the  reporting  recommendations  of  the  GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and, more specifically, standards GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2 and GRI 207-3.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a member of the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF),  a  European  companies  association  that  seeks  to increase transparency in the tax debate.\n\n## Legitimacy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  legitimately  applies  the  most  relevant  tax  treatment, in accordance  with  the  economic  reality,  operational objectives and the laws in force.\n\nIn  an  evolving  international  tax  environment,  the  positions taken  by  the  Group  may  be  questioned  and  subject  to  tax and customs audits by local authorities. If there is disagreement with a Tax or Customs Authority, L'Or\u00e9al is able to  legitimately  defend  its  interpretation  of  the  law,  prove  its good faith and, as needed, bring the disputes to court.\n\nA  regular  review  of  tax  risks,  carried  out  by  the  Group's  Tax Department in contact with the local financial teams, enables the  risks  to  be  assessed,  resulting,  if  applicable,  to  the recognition  of  a  provision.  The  main  risks  are  reported  to the General Management and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Organisation\n\nCentralised expertise and a strong geographical presence of the tax function in the Countries ensure compliance with these three pillars.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officers are responsible for tax compliance,  backed  up  and  relayed  by  the  Tax  and Accounting Departments. These Departments monitor changes in tax regulations to ensure that the Group complies with  these  regulations.  They  are  assisted,  where  applicable, by external advisors.\n\n## Centralised expertise\n\nWithin the Department of Operational Finance, the Group Tax Department  ensures  compliance  with  the  Tax  Policy  in collaboration with the Finance Departments, through intermediaries in the form of different group-wide tax experts:\n\n- \u00b7 Intra-group Transactions & Customs, which ensures compliance  with  tax  and  customs  standards  and  secures the  prices  of  intra-group  transactions  and  the  related documentation;\n- \u00b7 Analytics  &  Compliance,  which  analyses,  verifies  and informs on the Group's compliance and global tax liability;\n- \u00b7 Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), which assists and provides tax advice on proposed merger-acquisition projects;\n- \u00b7 Tax  Digitalisation,  which  enables  the  Group  to  meet  the new  requirements  for  digitalisation  imposed  by  the  tax authorities (e-returns, e-invoicing, e-audits, etc.);\n- \u00b7 Tax Governance, which ensures the correct deployment of the Group's tax policy; and\n- \u00b7 Digital Taxation and E-commerce, launched in 2022, which assists  and advises on the tax implications of e-commerce and digital projects.",

The  371  employees  in  the  Retail  Excellence  4,  Thermes  de La  Roche  Posay,  Saint  Gervais  Mont  Blanc,  \u00c9cole  OA and  Mugler  Fashion  entities  are  included  in  the  total workforce. The distributions of these employees are calculated in proportion to the distribution of France employees. They are excluded  from  the  indicators  on  diversity,  training,  minimum salaries and the number of collective agreements.\n\nIndicators : the  indicators  chosen  are  those  used  in  the management of employees and of the social aspects of the Company. They reflect the results of the HR policy.\n\nData: four  methods are used to collect data for the defined scope.  Most  of  the  data  are  collected  using  the  dedicated 'Country Reporting' Intranet, available in all countries in which there is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  'subsidiary'.  In  the  context  of  this  'Country Reporting',  a  subsidiary  is  a  structural  HR  concept:  each subsidiary  comprises  one  or  more  legal  entities,  and  covers one  country.  By  way  of  exception,  Korea,  the  United  States and  Hong  Kong  each  have  two  subsidiaries,  while  some subsidiaries cover several countries: the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia,  Estonia),  Croatia  (Croatia,  Slovenia),  UAE.  (UAE,  Saudi Arabia). The system covers several topics: employees; training; absenteeism;  labour  relations;  the  L'Or\u00e9al Share  &  Care programme;  remuneration;  diversity;  recruitment;  freedom  of association;  and  profit  sharing. At  the  beginning  of  the financial year, the local HR Directors provide the required data for the previous year. Other data are collected by the Training and Recruitment Departments using dedicated systems which follow  the  same  operational  and  dissemination  approach. If  information  is  not  consolidated  for  the  entire  scope  of  the Group, it can be extrapolated from the available results for the entities  connected  to  the  local  Information  Systems  (IS), provided  that  the  scope  covered  by  such  entities  is representative. The data relating to specific populations, such as expatriates or key positions, for example, are gathered from the 'CAROL' online career monitoring system, deployed in all subsidiaries of the Group. Trained employees include the total number  of  employees,  including  those  who  left  the  Group during the year, who completed at least one training course during  the  year,  regardless  of  the  format  (in-person,  virtual classroom, digital) and  length  of  the  training  course. Hours  spent  in  a  training  course  that  straddles  two  years  are recorded  in  the  second  year.    Training  hours  may  include lunch breaks for all-day training. Concerning the L'Or\u00e9al Share &  Care  indicator  relating  to  healthcare  coverage,  the  best practices  in  the  countries  are  regularly  evaluated  in  each country in which the Group is present.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place. They are reviewed each year, taking into account  the  Statutory  Auditors' recommendations  and\n\nthe monitoring objectives for subsequent years (updating the indicators to be monitored; improving their definition and their communication, monitoring and control process).\n\n## 4.5.1.2. Health and safety data\n\nScope of consolidation: safety indicators relate to 99.2% of the sites, such as factories, distribution centres, administrative sites, research  centres  with  more  than  50  employees,  stores, and  sales  forces.  At  year-end  2022,  172  administrative  sites and research centres, sales  forces  and  stores  participated  in the reporting. To achieve better monitoring of accident history by  type  of  site,  safety  reporting  from  administrative  sites  has been  refined  and  split  into  three  categories:  administrative sites  with  only  administrative  staff,  sales  forces  for  travelling staff  and  stores  for  in-store  beauty  consultants  managed by  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  safety  indicators  of  the  factories,  distribution centres, administrative sites or research centres sold or closed during  the  financial  year  are  reported  in  full  up  to  the  date they  exit  the  scope.  The  factories,  distribution  centres, administrative  sites  or  research  centres  that  join  the  Group have  a  maximum  period  of  two  years  to  integrate  the environmental and safety reporting systems.\n\nIndicators : the  indicators  applied  are  those  used  in  the management  of  the  Group's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results of  the  Group's  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  policy. Hours worked report the time during which the staff is exposed to  professional  risks,  including  remote  work  or  the  equivalent. They  include  overtime  hours.  However,  they  do  not  include public holidays or days of absence, such as sick days and paid holidays.\n\nData: the  health  and  safety  data  are  collected  using  the dedicated  Intranet-based  site reporting system. This is available in all countries in which there is a L'Or\u00e9al subsidiary. The  required  data  are  reported  every  month  by  the  local managers.  When  the  data  are  compiled,  each  site  or  zone must  validate  the  accuracy  of  all  the  data  provided. A  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place.\n\nThe systems are reviewed each year, taking into account the Statutory Auditors' recommendations and monitoring objectives for subsequent years (updating the indicators to be monitored;  improving  their  definition;  and  enhancing  the communication, monitoring and control process).\n\nIn rare cases,  certain  data  already  published  for  the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and included in the annual consistency review, before being included in the reported figures.",

Environmental data\n\nScope of consolidation: environmental indicators cover 98.8% of the factories and  distribution centres, as well as administrative  sites  and  research  centres  with  more  than 50  people.  Environmental  indicators  for  sites  sold  or  closed during  the  financial  year  are  reported  in  full  up  to  the  date they exit the scope. Sites joining the Group have a maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental and safety reporting systems. The indicators do not take into account the impacts  of  exceptional  external  incidents  or  events,  such  as construction  or  extension  works.  Similarly,  in  the  special  case where a subcontractor is located geographically on the sites, its impacts are not taken into account In 2022, 85 administrative sites and research centres participated in the reporting. Some sites are unable to obtain certain information (e.g.  water  withdrawal,  waste  generation  etc.)  and  may temporarily  use  estimates,  which  must  be  validated  by  the Operations  Department.  In  addition,  100%  of  these  sites provided  information  on  energy  consumption  and  CO2 emissions, 100% of the sites reported their water consumption and 100% of the sites reported their quantity of waste. The sites of  Vichy  and  La  Roche  Posay  are  part  of  a  single  company (Cosm\u00e9tique Active Production) but are accounted for as two Group  factories.  Four  Group  factories  contain  a  logistics centre  in  their  building.  These  four  logistics  centres  are  not included  in  the  count  of  the  total  number  of  Group  logistics centres.\n\nIndicators : the  indicators  chosen  are  those  used  in  the management of the Company's sites. They reflect the results of the Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy.\n\nActivity :  the  activity  of  L'Or\u00e9al  sites  is  measured  on  the  basis of  finished  goods  for  industrial  sites  and  hours  worked  for administrative sites and research centres. The production units included are the equivalent units produced on-site or affected by  occasional  subcontracting.  Hours  worked  are  the  hours performed on-site, thus excluding remote working hours.\n\nGreenhouse gases : the Group's CO  emissions are calculated in  accordance  with  the  concepts  defined  by  the GHG Protocol ,  and monitored according to the Market-Based CO 2 indicator. 2\n\nManagement  of  the  reference  year : in  accordance  with the  methodology  of  the  GHG  Protocol  relating  to  the management  of  reference  years,  CO   emissions  data  are reviewed, if  necessary,  in  accordance  with  the  rules  defined by  the  Group  using  a  like-for-like  recalculation.  In  this  way, base  years  take  into  account  investments  and  divestments (brands,  sites),  changes  in  methodologies,  significant  errors and  changes  in  scope.  Any  changes  in  base  years  are validated by the Statutory Auditors. 2\n\nScope  1:  the  main  emissions  are  related  to  natural  gas;  the consumption data are taken from supplier invoices. Potential leaks of cooling gas from refrigeration units are also included in the  calculations.  The  emission  factors  used  come  from  the ADEME Base Carbone database (Agence de l'Environnement et  de  la  Ma\u00eetrise  de  l'\u00c9nergie,  the  French  Agency  for  the\n\nEnvironment and Energy Management) for fossil fuels, such as natural gas, fuel oil, etc. and the 6 th report of the IPCC (IPCC AR6)  for  cooling  gas.  All  data  are  incorporated  into  the internal reporting software on a monthly basis.\n\nScope  2:  the  main  emissions  are  related  to  electricity;  the consumption  data  are  taken  from  supplier  invoices.  The emission  factors  used  come  directly  from  the  sites'  electricity suppliers,  using  the  Market-Based  approach,  or  from  the International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  if  the  data  are  not available.  The  emission  factors  used  for  emissions  related  to heat, cooling and steam networks come from local suppliers. All  data  are  incorporated into the internal reporting software on a monthly basis.\n\nScope 3: Scope 3 emissions, linked to the L'Or\u00e9al value chain, are  calculated  annually  using  emission  factors  from  various databases,  specific  to  each  Scope  3  category,  including, among  others, the ADEME  Base  Carbone  database, EcoInvent, the DBEIS and the IEA.\n\nLevel  of  uncertainty:    for  Scopes  1  and  2,  the  level  of uncertainty at the Group level is approximately 1% for factories and  distribution  centres,  and  5%  for  administrative  sites  and research centres. For Scope 3, the level of uncertainty is higher given the volume of data required for calculation, such as the emission  factors  of  the  energy  used  to  heat  the  water necessary for the usage phase of our rinse-off products all over the  world,  the  quantity  of  water  necessary  for  rinsing,  CO emissions of raw materials and packaging suppliers, distances travelled for transportation etc. 2\n\nMeasurement  of  the  global  CO   impact  of  the  Group's business  activities  is  essential  information.  In  light  of  the commitments  made  to  combating  climate  change,  L'Or\u00e9al strives year after year to increase the reliability of this data. The level  of  uncertainty  of  the  Group's  Scope  3  emissions  is estimated to be between 20% and 30%. Unlike Scopes 1 and 2, changes in Scope 3 emissions may relate more to the quality of  the  data  collected  and  the  calculation  methods  used, rather  than  to  a  real  change  in  performance.  This  margin  of uncertainty  with  regard  to  Scope  3  is  a  reality  for  all companies and does not make it possible to consider this data as  an  adequate  benchmark  or  method  of  performance assessment. 2\n\n'Carbon  neutral' (1) : see  section  4.3.1.1.3.  The  Vichy  and La  Roche  Posay  sites  are  part  of  a  unique  company  (CAP), but  are  recognised  as  two  Group  factories,  including  in  the recognition  of  sites  that  have  achieved  'carbon  neutral' status.  The  diesel-powered  handling  equipment  operated  by one of the Group's sites (Libramont plant) is not included in the 'carbon  neutral'  calculation.  It  represented  3  tonnes  of CO2eq  in  2022.  A  study  will  be  launched  in  2023  to  assess the overall impact in terms of tonnes of CO2eq of this use on all the sites. The aim is to remove these uses or find alternatives (e.g. electric motor)\n\nWastewater : for industrial sites, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  covers  the  volumes  of  wastewater  leaving  the  plant, whether or not they have been treated on the site.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exceptions to the definition of Waterloop status may be  authorised  if  they  are  approved  by  the  Operations Department. These exceptions relate to regulatory constraints such as the requirements of the US Food  and  Drug Administration,  or  the  Group's  Quality  requirements.  With production levels at the plant in Mexico increasing significantly, the  capacity  of  the  on-site  water  treatment  and  recycling facilities  was  inadequate  to  support  this  change.  As  such, for  a  few  months  during  2022,  the  plant  did  not  satisfy  the conditions for achieving Waterloop status. Additional investments have been made since the end of 2022 in order to restore compliance with these conditions.\n\nWaste : L'Or\u00e9al classifies as transportable waste everything that comes  out  of  a  factory  or  a  distribution  centre  that  is  not a  finished  or  semi-finished  product  for  consumption.  For  a factory, this includes, for example, raw materials packaging or packaging materials,  broken  pallets  etc.  In  order  to  improve the system of waste performance monitoring and exhaustively record  the  waste  generated  by  the  use  of  returnable packaging,  a  system  of  recording  returnable  packaging  at source  was  put  in  place  in  2014.  L'Or\u00e9al  thus  records  the weight of its returnable packaging at source in transportable waste.  Each  site  maximises  the  number  of  times  returnable packaging is used. The recording of the weight of returnable packaging  at  source  is  a  measure  intended  to  encourage rotation of this returnable packaging and contributes, through its  reuse,  to  increasing  its  useful  life.  Sites  that  no  longer  send any waste for destruction or to landfill are considered to have attained a 100% recovery rate (1) .\n\nSince  2021,  waste  generation  no  longer  includes  the  sludge from the wastewater treatment plans at the Group's sites.\n\nEnergy : the energy produced by geothermal heat pumps is no longer counted in the Group's total energy consumption. The energy  necessary  for  the  operation  of  this  equipment  is, however, included in the Group's energy consumption.\n\nBiodiversity :  inventories  that  describe  the  actual  situation  of the sites  in  terms  of  species  and  habitats  present  in  the  zone studied must be carried out by a certified organisation at least every three years.\n\nHold  Flat  commitment:  with  the  support  of  expert  firm  The Biodiversity  Consultancy,  a  standardised  approach  has  been developed to enable the land-use biodiversity footprint of biobased ingredients to be calculated each year. This approach is based on three parameters: (1) the ground surface required, (2)  the  loss  of  biodiversity  due  to  land  use  and  intensity  of agricultural  practices  and  (3)  the  significance  of  biodiversity in  the  ecosystem  in  question.  The  first  two  parameters  are multiplied  to  represent  a  ground  surface  area  in  which  100% of  biodiversity  is  lost  (value  expressed  in  Mean  Species Abundance per hectare, MSA.ha).\n\nLand-use biodiversity footprint =\n\n- \u25cf (1) Ground surface x (2) Biodiversity loss due to land use and intensity of agricultural practices (MSA.ha),\n- \u25cf (3)  The  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the  ecosystem  in question\n\nThe required ground surface (1) is estimated in three steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Step 1: The volumes of raw materials (combined ingredients) are divided into volumes of ingredients made from plants.\n- \u00b7 Step 2: Ingredient volumes are converted to plant volumes using  conversion  factors  based  on  life-cycle  assessment data (Ecoinvent, World Food Database, Agribalyse), supplier data and literature.\n- \u00b7 Step 3: The ground surface required to produce the plants is estimated by multiplying the plant volume by the average yields  for  each  plant.  For  the  main  plants,  average  yields were  extracted  at  the  most  accurate  spatial  resolution available  in  the  supply  data  using  the  Our  World  in  Data (average  yields  available  until 2018) and  MapSPAM (average  yields  from  2010)  spatial  databases.  A  review  of the  literature  was  used  to  estimate  the  average  (global) yield  for  the  other  plants.  An  additional  land  use  area  for crop-related infrastructure (roads and farms) was also taken into  account  for  each  plant,  calculated  on  the  basis  of a  proportion  of  the  infrastructure  surface  area  specific to each plant (data taken from Ecoinvent).\n\nIngredients  whose  traceability  is  not  currently  known  (plants and/or  countries)  have  been  integrated  into  the  footprint using  their  relative  contribution  distribution  when  the  data  is known.\n\n## Biodiversity loss due to agricultural practices (2):\n\nMean  Species  Abundance  per  hectare  is  a  unit  of measurement  corresponding  to  the  equivalent  land  surface that  has  lost  100%  of  its  biodiversity.  This  metric  is  used  to measure ecosystem integrity.\n\nBiodiversity loss coefficients for land use are derived from the GLOBIO model database (providing average biodiversity loss values  according  to  land-use  type  and  intensity)  and  then refined  for  each  plant  based  on  a  literature  review  (final values vary between 70% and 90% biodiversity loss depending on the plant). For infrastructure, the biodiversity loss coefficient for land use is also taken from the GLOBIO models (the value for  urbanised  areas,  i.e.  95%  biodiversity  loss,  is  identical  for each plant).\n\n## Focus  on  the  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the  ecosystem  in question (3):\n\nThe  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the  production  area  is assessed  using  the  Species  Threat  Abatement  and  Recovery (STAR) metric. STAR assesses the conservation potential in terms of reducing the risk of species extinction in an area of special interest  either  by  threat  reduction  or  habitat  restoration. The metric was developed based on data from the IUCN Red List  of  Threatened  Species  (STAR  mapping in December 2022 is based  on  the  2019.3  version  of  the  IUCN  Red  List; STAR currently includes mammals, birds and amphibians). The 80 th percentile  was  used  to  represent  the  presence  of  high values  while  avoiding  overestimation  by  taking  into  account the  maximum  value  only.  Each  region  or  country  is  then assigned to a risk category ranging from very low to very high. As  the  STAR  distribution  is  highly  skewed  towards  low  values (97%  of  STAR  values  worldwide  are  in  the  very  low  and  low categories), the use of the mean or median is not appropriate. Each  region  or  country  is  then  assigned  to  a  risk  category ranging from very low to very high by taking the higher of the following  two  values:  the  STAR  80 th percentile  for  threat reduction  or  the  STAR  80th  percentile  for  habitat  restoration. As the distribution of STAR values is very uneven and skewed towards  low  and  very  low  values,  any  region  or  country categorised  as  medium,  high  or  very  high  risk  represents an important area for biodiversity in which there is a significant risk of impacting rich and vulnerable biodiversity .",

The  required  data  are reported every month by the local managers. When the data are compiled, each Site or Zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided. A process of continuous improvement of these systems has been put in place and they are  reviewed  each  year  by  the  Statutory  Auditors.  They  are modified  taking  into  account  their  recommendations  and monitoring objectives for subsequent years, such as updating the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition and the communication, monitoring and control processes. In rare cases, certain data already published for the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and  included  in  the  annual  consistency  review.  They  are included in the reported figures each year.\n\n## 4.5.2. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future data\n\n## 4.5.2.1. Transforming the Group's activities\n\nReduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  transport of  finished  products : the  scope  considered  includes  the transportation  of  the  Group's  finished  and  promotional products from its production sites to the first point of delivery to the  customer.  Deliveries  made  directly  to  consumers  are excluded.  The  period  considered  is  12  months,  between 1  November  of  year  n-1  and  31  October  of  year  n.  The calculation  methodology  employed  uses  greenhouse  gas emissions  factors,  in  grams  of  CO2  equivalent  per  tonne  of merchandise transported and per km travelled. These factors depend  on  the  mode  of  transport  and  the  type  of  energy used. These were updated in 2021 by Quantis in light of current technological knowledge.\n\nRespecting biodiversity  with  traceable,  bio-based  ingredients from sustainable sources: the calculation of the percentage of bio-based  ingredients  for  traced  formulas  from  a  sustainable source is based on the following definitions: a raw material is considered  to  be  bio-based  when  more  than  50%  of  the carbons it contains are of plant origin (according to ISO 16128); an  ingredient  is  considered  traced  when  the  following  three pieces  of  information  are  available:  the  botanical  species, the  country  in  which  it  grows  or  is  collected,  the  growing or  collection  method;  an  ingredient  is  considered  to  be sustainably  sourced  when,  on  the  basis  of  the  elements of  traceability,  it  has  been  analysed  for  environmental  and social risk (SCAN Index). If no risk has been identified, the raw material is considered to be sustainably sourced. If risks have been identified, an adapted action plan must have been put in  place  with  this  supplier.  This  action  plan  must  have  been verified by an independent third party. Such verification may take the form of an audit, certification, or a field project put in place  with  the  support  of  an  NGO.  This  method  ensures compliance  with  the  basic  and  progressive  criteria  of  the sustainable  sourcing  policy  for  the  Group's  raw  materials.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is based on actual purchases for  the  period  from  January  to  November  2022,  excluding volumes of ingredients used for fragrance compositions (<1%), subcontracting  volumes  (0.8%)  as  well  as  volumes  from factories  (India,  Argentina  and  Kenya)  not  linked  to  the  IDG management system (3.3%).\n\nReduction of the water consumption related to the use of the products: the scope of consolidation refers to the data on the products  sold  over  a  period  of  12  months  from  1  January  to 31 December of 2022.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is based on the average water volume necessary per usage dose for the use of the Group's products by consumers. These data are provided by the IDG management software, which is used for the economic results. It  includes  all  global  sales  of  finished  products,  both  rinse-off and  leave-in.  The  only  exception  is  samples,  which  are  not products sold and are therefore not taken into account.\n\nEco-designed  products  -  SPOT: eco-designed  products  are new or updated products that have an improved environmental  or  social  profile.  The  indicator  covers  the Group's  scope  and  concerns  new  products  or  products updated  by  design  centres  that  were  manufactured  by  the Group's  factories or by subcontractors. They had  an availability date at the distribution centre that was scheduled for  between  1  January  and  31  December  2022.  The  analysis covers  all  the  Group's  brands,  excluding:  products  not  sold ( i.e. samples, testers, gifts, products made at the point of sale, temporary  activations,  promotional  products  and  additional packaging relating to 'travel  retail'),  newly  acquired  brands that  are  not  yet  fully  integrated  into  the  Group's  product design ecosystem (Mugler, Logocos, Thayers, Takami, Youth to the people, 3CE and Skin better science).\n\nThe  indicator  covers  products  with  formulas/packaging  that have  been  developed  and  produced  for  the  first  time, products with formulas/packaging that were updated in 2022 (i.e.  underwent  a  major  change  in  packaging  or  formula requiring a change in the commercial code) or products that have been improved in terms of the social dimension\n\nIngredients  in  formulas  are  from  bio-based  sources,  derived from abundant materials or from circular processes\n\nScope of consolidation: the scope of consolidation corresponds  to  the  twelve  months  of  the  year.  It  covers  the cosmetic products manufactured in the L'Or\u00e9al factories and the finished products purchased from subcontractors.\n\nThe  scope covers  only  the  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  operating  under the SAP  WISE system,  which  permits  the  feedback  of information via the IDG information system. To date, there are only  four  Group  factories  that  are  outside  the  scope:  the factories in Pune and Badi in India, the Magdal factory in Israel and the Nairobi factory in Kenya.\n\nThe  indicator: the  reporting  covers  99.4%  of  production  from L'Or\u00e9al factories. This indicator is evaluated for all the Group's active  formulas  and  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  data on  production  volume.  The  data  are  processed,  including consistency checks and corrections of anomalies if necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are three elements that are calculated independently. The  'biobased'  portion  represents  the  percentage  of  raw materials  of  renewable  origin  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  portfolio  according to the definition of ISO 16128. The 'abundant mineral' portion refers  to  the  percentage  of  ingredients  of  mineral  origin,  the abundance of which allows sustainable use and the inorganic ingredients,  i.e.  non-mineral  and  not  containing  any  carbon atoms (e.g. oxygenated water), obtained by green processes. The  definition  of  abundant  minerals  has  been  established  by the  Raw  Materials  Department  (DIMP)  with  the  assistance  of an  expert  consultant  from  the  French  Bureau  of  Geological and Mining Research (Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res  -  BRGM).  An  initial  list  was  available  at  the  start  of 2022  that  covers  40%  in  volume  of  the  minerals  used  by  the Group, i.e. 463  raw  materials  identified.  This  list  is  subject  to change and will be updated over the coming years. Finally, the  'circular  process'  portion  is  still  being  established  by  the Raw  Materials  Department  (DIMP)  with  the  assistance  of experts and will be made available soon.\n\n## Resources - Data on packaging indicators\n\nScope  of  consolidation :  the  packaging  data  cover  all  the finished  products  leaving  the  factories,  with  the  exception  of certain finished products for which the data are not yet linked to  the  central  information  systems.  This  is  the  case  for  the products  from  the  factories  in  Migdal,  Nairobi,  Funza  or Salzhelmmendorf,  for  certain  subcontracted  products  from recent  acquisitions,  and  packaging  specific  to  Travel  Retail. These packaging data exclude POS/PLV materials.\n\n## Indicators\n\n## 1. Percentage of created or renovated products with a better environmental profile due to improved packaging\n\nEach year, SPOT calculates the proportion of new or updated products  whose  environmental  profile  has  been  improved. For  a  new  product,  improvement  is  measured  in  relation  to an average of the brand's existing and comparable products. For  an  updated  product,  improvement  is  measured  and compared to the previous version of the product.\n\n## 2. Percentage of certified paper and cardboard\n\nThe  data  on  the  percentage  of  FSC-certified  paper  and cardboard  (sourced  from  wood  derivatives)  comes  from tracking  the  supplies  of  all  suppliers.  The  Group's  sourcing entities  demand  that  each  of  their  suppliers  complete  the information on tonnage and provide the related certifications. The data are aggregated by the central sourcing department.\n\n## 3. Reduction  in  intensity  of  the  quantity  of  packaging  used for the Group's products\n\nThe reduction in packaging intensity is measured in packaging weight divided by the weight of the formula. The unit is g/g. The  scope  is  all  the  packaging  leaving  a  factory  (primary, secondary or tertiary). The reduction in intensity is calculated from  specification  systems  for  filling,  packing  and  production articles. The data are aggregated at global level by the data management teams.\n\n## 4. Percentage of plastic packaging recycled or from biobased sources\n\nThe tonnages of plastic materials recycled or from bio-based sources used in the products come from specification systems for the filling and packaging components and the production of finished products. The data are aggregated at global level by  the  data  management  teams.  The  portion  of  recycled plastic is an actual rate of recycled material in the packaging: it  does  not  come  from  a  mass  balance  certification  system.\n\nThe scope of this indicator is all the plastic from all our primary, secondary and tertiary packaging leaving the factory.\n\n## 5. Percentage of plastic packaging that is refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable\n\nThe definitions of refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging  follow  the  definitions  of  the  Ellen  Mc  Arthur Foundation described in the document 'New Plastics Economy Global  Commitment  -  Reporting  Guidelines  April  2022'.  These definitions are taken  account  of  in  the  Group's  data management  systems,  which  allow  the  respective  quantities to  be  identified  and  counted. The scope of this indicator is all primary and secondary plastic packaging, i.e. any  packaging containing  more  than  50%  plastic  by  weight.  Recyclability  is assessed on the basis of impediments to recycling, linked to the materials  and  decorations  used,  and  can  change  annually  in line with changes to regulations.\n\nData :  the  different  indicators  or  figures  come  from  product specification  systems  linked  to  the  production  management tools.  The  data  are  extracted  and  recovered  by  the  Data Management  teams  who  aggregate  them  globally  using  a centralised IT tool. The Sustainability entity of the Department of Packaging and Development verifies all the elements and the figures.\n\n## Eco-designed advertising displays at points of sale\n\nScope of consolidation : the scope of consolidation covers POS purchasing expenses, such as displays or advertising elements at  the  points  of  sale,  in  the  countries  in  which  a  L'Or\u00e9al subsidiary that has a Sourcing team is established. Every year the Sourcing teams in question report the POS expenses and the percentage of compliance with eco-design 'Must Haves'.\n\nData :  Country  data  are  collected  using  the  Intranet  system dedicated to reporting by country, which can be accessed by each Sourcing  team.  Each  team  is  responsible  for  compiling the data for their Country, and must validate the accuracy of the data communicated. The data are also validated by the Sourcing  Zones.  The  indicator  is  consolidated  at  the  Group level by the Global Retail Sourcing teams. In 2022, 53 Countries or Hubs participated in the reporting. The Sourcing teams and suppliers  concerned  are  trained  in  eco-design,  including the associated data collection process. The process is defined and  explained  every  year  to  the  teams  responsible. The  percentage  of  eco-designed  POS  is  calculated  in accordance with a self-declared statement from the suppliers trained in eco-design.\n\n## Eco-design of owned stores and points of sale\n\nScope of consolidation :  the  scope  includes  the  Group's  new and renovated free-standing stores over a global scope. The period considered is from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nA  store  is  considered  ecodesigned  if  the  ecodesign  rate exceeds  100%  or  if  the  store  is  LEED  Gold  certified.  The ecodesign rate of the free-standing stores is calculated on the basis  of  the  process  tracking  and  the  documentation  of  the Sustainable  Retail  Box  checklist  and  according  to  a  selfdeclaration  of  compliance  of  the  points  of  sale,  unless  the store holds an external LEED certification.\n\nData : at the time the data is compiled, each Country team is responsible for verifying the accuracy of all data communicated to the teams of each of the Zones. The teams monitoring  the  process  and  the  documentation  of  the Sustainable  Retail  Box  checklist  are  trained  in  ecodesign. A  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place.",

        "page_content": "## 4.5.2.2. Empowering the Group's business ecosystem\n\n## Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation\n\nScope of consolidation: to define the list of strategic suppliers, the  spend  baseline is  from  March  2022.  The  N-1  spend  is updated at the end of October for indicators related to the CDP  and  the  environmental  and  social  performance  of suppliers.\n\nData: Suppliers  participating  in  the  CDP  had  to  be  invited  in advance by L'Or\u00e9al according to defined criteria:\n\n- \u25cf CDP  Climate  Change:  In  2014,  participation  in  the  CDP Climate Change programme was made compulsory for all strategic suppliers. The Group also invites suppliers that are strategic for a Zone or country.\n- \u25cf CDP  Water:  L'Or\u00e9al  selects  suppliers  according  to  three criteria:  particularly  water-intensive  technology  or  activity; location of at least one production site in a water-stressed catchment area; size of L'Or\u00e9al's purchasing volumes.\n- \u25cf CDP  Forest:  L'Or\u00e9al  selects  suppliers  according  to  the impact of their activity on deforestation. Major suppliers of paper, palm oil and soy are invited to participate.\n\nClarification :  no  attempted  bribery  occurred  this  year  during the  social  audits.  The  attempted  bribery  mentioned  in  the audit report refers to an attempt to bribe the auditor and not to  the  fact  that  the  supplier  may  have  been  involved  in  a bribery case\n\n## Beneficiaries of the Solidarity Sourcing programme :\n\nScope  of  consolidation : the  period  considered  is  from  1 January to 31 December over a worldwide scope. This scope covers  workers  from  economically  or  socially  disadvantaged communities  who  work  at  the  Group's  suppliers  and  at  their subcontractors. Beneficiaries of the Solidarity Sourcing programme  must  produce  materials,  goods  or  services purchased by L'Or\u00e9al. At least one of the following two criteria must be fulfilled: access to and remaining in a permanent job if  their community is generally excluded or under-represented in  the  activity,  or  a  substantial  and  lasting  improvement  in income thanks to the activity associated with the programme (fair sourcing).\n\nData : in the majority of projects, the methodology is based on the number of FTEs under local regulations, on the basis of a full  year. The FTE number is proportional to L'Or\u00e9al's weight in the  supplier's  business  activity,  i.e.  the  proportion  of  the supplier's  payroll  that  is  involved  in  the  production  of  L'Or\u00e9al products. If the supplier's employees work for other customers, the  amount  of  the  orders  in  relation  to  the  supplier's  total revenue  determines  the  number  of  hours  assigned  to  the L'Or\u00e9al  production.  For  projects  related  to  the  sustainable sourcing of natural raw materials, the unit of measurement of the  beneficiaries  is  not  FTE,  but  the  number  of  producers concerned. The supplier, with the assistance of an independent  third  party,  defines  a  threshold  at  which  the project has a significant impact on the target community with respect to the local situation.\n\n## People from very difficult social or economic situations trained in beauty professions.\n\nScope  of  consolidation :  this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a worldwide scope using annual data. This scope covers people trained  on  beauty  skills  under  the  Beauty  for  a  Better  Life programme  implemented  by  partner  organisations  between 1 January and 31 December.\n\nData : the managers of the programme at L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries aggregate  the  data  on  the  basis  of  the  information  and  a certificate of compliance transmitted to them by the partner organisations.  The  Foundation  teams  within  the  Department of Corporate Responsibility consolidate the data and check it for consistency.\n\n## People in very difficult social or economic situations who have benefited from beauty care and wellbeing treatments\n\nScope  of  consolidation :  this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a France  scope  using  annual  data.  This  scope  covers  people who  have  benefitted  from  beauty  care  and  well-being treatments  under  the  Beauty  for  a  Better  Life  programme implemented  by  partner  organisations  between  1  January and 31 December.\n\nData :  the  data  are  collected  by  the  programme's  partner organisations.  The  Foundation  teams  consolidate  the  data and check it for consistency.\n\n## Beneficiaries of our brands' social engagement programmes\n\nScope  of  consolidation :  this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a scope  limited  to  the  brands  that  have  social  engagement programmes. The scope excludes the brands' environmental programmes, product donations and awareness-raising media campaigns.\n\nData :  in  order  to  be  counted  for,  a  beneficiary  must  be  a person  who  is  either  supported  by  a  partner  NGO  with  a sustainable  impact,  via,  for  example,  an  educational  grant, medical treatment, personalised psychological support, or any other initiative under the brand's social engagement programme;  or  supported  by  a  brand  via  a  training programme  that  has  been  co-created  with  a  partner  NGO. The  data  are  approved  and  transmitted  by  the  NGOs,  then consolidated by the brands via a digital tool.\n\n## Displaying the environmental and social impact of the products\n\nScope  of  consolidation: the  indicators  concern  all  rinse-off products  that  belong  to  one  of  the  following  categories: Shampoo,  Conditioner  &  Mask,  Dye,  Face  Cleanser,  Body Cleanser, Targeted Facial Shock Treatment, Deep Cleanser & Face Mask, manufactured during 2022 on a Group scope. The indicators  do  not  count  the  Hand  Cleanser  and  Rinse-off Shave Cream categories.\n\nThe  indicators  used  are  those  used  in  the  application  of  the Product Impact Labelling (PIL) methodology. They reflect the results  of  the  Group's  policy  for  measuring the environmental and  social  impact  of  the  products.  The  calculation  method and the data are verified by Bureau Veritas, an independent auditor.\n\nData: the  data  for  the  defined  scope  is  collected  by  the Operations Department using SPOT (Sustainable Product Optimisation Tool). All SPOT exclusions also apply to this indicator.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contribute to solving the challenges of the world\n\n## Supporting the most vulnerable women\n\nScope  of  consolidation :  this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a global  scope  using  data  accumulated  since  the  Fund  was launched. It is the number of organisations supported by the Fund,  the  number  of  women  directly  supported  by  these organisations with the assistance of the Fund, and the budget in euros allocated since the launch of the Fund.\n\nData :  data  are  collected  by  the  organisations  supported  by the  Fund  which  have  used  all  or  a  portion  of  the  budget allocated  during  the  reference  period.  The  Fund's  teams (within  the  Corporate  Responsibility  Department)  consolidate the  data.  They  carry  out  consistency  checks  on  the  basis\n\n## 4.5.3. Human Rights data\n\nScope of consolidation :  this  concerns the Human Rights data arising  from  Ethics  reporting.  This  scope  is  identical  to  that  of social data.\n\nIndicators :  the  indicators  have  been selected in line with the applicable  regulations,  and  to  enable  data  comparison,  in particular.\n\nData :  the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department  collects the  data  relating  to  Ethics  and  Human  Rights  for  L'Or\u00e9al subsidiaries using  the  Annual  Ethics  Reporting  platform.\n\n## 4.5.4. Taxonomy data\n\nThe  financial  and  technical  information  used  for  this  analysis has  been  the  subject  of  additional  reporting  and  of  joint analysis and checking by the local and central teams for the 2022 financial year.\n\nProcess  for  identifying  and  assessing  eligible  investments  for 2022 :  the  vast  majority  of  the  Group's  eligible  investments (89%)  correspond  to  data  relating  to  leases  that  have  been capitalised in accordance with IFRS 16. The Group's other eligible investments  (11%)  correspond  to  construction,  renovation  and maintenance projects.\n\nLeases  on  premises  and  vehicles  that  are  capitalised  in accordance with IFRS 16 were valued as shown in the Group's consolidated balance sheet (89%).\n\nCapital expenditure related to 'individual measures' taken by the Real Estate Department was subject to self-assessment by the  Real  Estate  finance  departments.  The  Group's  financial tools  are  not,  to  date,  capable  of  tracking  investments according  to  the  nomenclature  of  the  activities  that  are eligible under the Taxonomy. With the help of their Real Estate Experts,  the  Financial  Directors  of  each  Zone  have  identified significant eligible projects. The analysis was conducted using a  threshold  of  work,  so  as  to  focus  the  analysis  on  the  most significant  projects.  The  amounts  reported  by  the  Financial Directors  correspond  to  the  best  estimate  of  the  real investment amounts committed in 2022.\n\nCapital expenditure related to 'individual measures' taken by the Operations Department was subject to self-assessment by the  Finance  and  Operations  Departments.  The  Group's financial tools are  not,  to  date,  capable  of  tracking investments  according  to  the  nomenclature  of  the  activities that  are  eligible  under  the  Taxonomy.  The  projects  were identified on the basis of the climate monitoring of the L'Or\u00e9al\n\nof  the  information  reported  and  a  certificate  of  compliance transmitted by the partner organisations. The budget allocated is monitored and consolidated by the Fund's teams in cooperation with L'Or\u00e9al's Finance team.\n\n## Contributing to the regeneration of nature\n\nRehabilitation :  restoration  focuses  on  halting  and  reversing ecosystem  degradation  and  recovering  biodiversity.

Science-Based  Targets for Nature: Initial Guidance for Business\n\nThe  scope  is  aligned  with  individual  company  data  unless otherwise indicated for each indicator. Human Rights data for the  employees  of  the  Group's  suppliers  are  consolidated  by the Purchasing Department and collected mainly during social audits  conducted  by  an  independent  and  accredited  third party.  This  third  party  then  shares  the  data  and  the  audit reports with the Group.  The other data are collected from the Departments  concerned:  Corporate  Social  Responsibility, Worldwide  Product  Safety  Evaluation, Ethics, Risk and Compliance, and the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation.\n\nfor the Future programme, using a threshold of work, so as to focus the analysis on the most significant projects.\n\nChecks  are  conducted  centrally  to  ensure  each  project  is eligible  and  to  ensure  that  the  same  project  is  not  counted twice.\n\nApproach  to  the  qualification  of  2022  aligned  investments: in  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  the  Delegated  Acts, an investment is classified as 'aligned' to the Taxonomy, if it meets the three criteria below.\n\n1.  The  technical  criteria  for  substantial  contribution  broken down  by  business  activity: In  terms  of  the  acquisition  of buildings constructed before 2021 for which experts appointed by  the  Group  do  not  have  the  buildings'  EPC (1) or  are  not aware  of  the  threshold  relating  to  the  top  15%  of  the  best performing buildings  in  terms  of  primary  energy  consumption at  national  or  regional  level,  the  labels  for  which  energy performance  is  a  certification  criterion  and  for  which  the maximum level of certification has been reached, the buildings in question have been considered, in the context of this transition exercise, as making a substantial contribution to  climate  change  mitigation  with  regard  to  the  Taxonomy. The  buildings  are  then  considered  highly  likely  to  be  among the  best  performing  buildings  in  the  country  and  should  be placed in the top 15% of the country or region. If the label's best  score  is  not  achieved,  a  case-by-case  analysis  is conducted.  For  these  buildings,  the  experts  reconstitute primary  energy  consumption  from  energy  consumption  by applying  a  conversion  factor  that  is  specific  to  the  country in  which  the  building  is  located.  They  then  compare  it  to national or regional thresholds in order to confirm that it comes in the top 15% locally.",

The  experts  also ensure  that  the  other  technical  criteria  set  out  in  the Delegated  Acts  for  building  acquisitions  are  met  in  order  to classify the alignment with the Taxonomy.\n\nWhere renovation or repairs that improve energy efficiency or equipment for renewable energies are concerned, the Group ensures  that  the  work  complies  strictly  with  the  respective criteria laid down in the Delegated Acts for each activity.\n\n2. The five other objectives of the Taxonomy (DNSH) : a project must  not  harm  any  of  the  other  five  objectives  of  the Taxonomy:  climate  change  adaptation,  water,  biodiversity, pollution and the circular economy. An external organisation has  conducted  the  analyses  for  climate  change  adaptation for this year. These analyses were carried out according to the scenarios  RCP  2.6,  RCP  4.5,  RCP  8.5 (1) with  the  time  horizons\n\n2040, 2050, 2060. An initial inventory of adaptation solutions has been  drawn  up.  Their  assessments  will  be  further  developed during 2023.\n\nThe  other  analyses  are  conducted  on  the  basis  of  the information available for each project and activity, in view of the criteria laid down by the Delegated Acts.\n\n- 3. Compliance with the 'minimum safeguards' : the 'minimum social'  criteria  are  reviewed  centrally,  by  the  Responsible Purchasing  Departments  and  the  Human  Rights  Department, in  light  of  the  requirements  of  the  report  on  the  minimum safeguards  issued  by  the  Platform  on  Sustainable  Finance (PSF).  L'Or\u00e9al  guarantees  that  procedures  have  been  put  in place  in  respect  of  the  four  themes  set  out  below.  These measures are considered to be effective  if  (i)  no  complaints have  been  lodged  against  the  Group  or  against  a  L'Or\u00e9al employee  or  (ii)  an  action  plan  is  implemented  following a  complaint  in  one  of  the  following  four  areas:  respect  for human  rights  (including  consumer  rights);  anti-corruption practices; tax policy implemented; raising employee awareness of the importance of complying with all applicable laws and regulations in the field of competition law.\n\n## 4.6.

Some information is sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions, and/or estimates used in their preparation and presented in the Management Report.\n\n## Entity's responsibility\n\nAs part of this voluntary approach, it is the responsibility of the Entity to prepare the Information in accordance with the Guidelines, and  of  which  a  summary  is  included  in  the  Management  Report  and  availabl  on  request  from  the  General  Management  of Operations, Human Resources, Purchasing, and Environmental and Social Responsibility departments.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe are responsible, in response to the Entity's request, based on our work, to express a reasonable assurance conclusion that the Information is prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nIt  is  not  our  responsibility  to  report  on  the  entire  Management  Report  for  the  year  ended  on  the  31  December  2022  or  on  the compliance with other applicable legal provisions.\n\n## Professional standards applied\n\nOur  work  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  professional  guidance  issued  byhe  French  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors and  ISAE 3000 (revised) standard \"Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" published by the IAASB (International Auditing and Assurance Standard Board). ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes )\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nOur  independence  is  defined  by  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  for  Statutory  Auditors of  our  profession.

The  nature,  timing,  and  extent  of  the  procedures  selected  are  within  our  professional  judgment,  particularly  our evaluation of the risks that the Information contains significant misstatements, whether they result from fraud or error. In assessing these risks, we have taken into account the relevant internal control for the preparation of the Information by the Entity. We also :\n\n- \u00b7 assessed the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of its relevance, comprehensiveness, reliability, neutrality and understandability by taking into consideration, if relevant, the best practices of the industry.\n- \u00b7 performed, on the Information:\n- \u00b7 analytical procedures to verify the correct consolidation of the collected data as well as the consistency of their evolutions;\n- \u00b7 detailed tests based on samples, to check the correct application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out with a selection of contributing entities listed below:\n- \u00b7 for the selected social Information: activities in China, Mexico and Italy, which cover 21% of the group's workforce;\n- \u00b7 for the selected societal Information: the headquarters of the entity that centralizes all information;\n- \u00b7 for the selected environmental and health and safety Information: Belgium (Libramont), Brazil (Sao Paulo), Canada (Florence, Montreal, DC Ville Saint-Laurent), China (Suzhou), Spain (Burgos, DC Burgos), United-States of America (DC South Brunswick, Piscataway, North Little Rock, DC North Little Rock), France (Vichy-LRP, Mourenx), Italy (Settimo), Japan (Gotemba), Poland (Warsaw, DC Blonie), Turkey (Istanbul), representing 47% of Group activity (in units of finished goods reviewed). This work covers between 25% and 53% of the consolidated data selected for these tests (25% of hours worked by L'Or\u00e9al employees, 29% of work-related  accidents,  45%  of  CO2  emissions  according  to  the  'location-based'  method,  43%  of  total  waste,  53%  of  net water withdrawal).\n\nWe consider that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have selected through our professional judgment allow us to provide a reasonable assurance conclusion. However, due to the use of sampling techniques as well as other inherent limitations in the functioning  of  any  information  and  internal  control  system,  the  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  in  the  Information cannot be completely eliminated.\n\nWe believe  that  this  work  enable  us  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  Information  has  been  prepared,  in  all  material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March 9  2023 The Statutory Auditors th\n\nDELOITTE & ASSOCIES\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid DUPONT-NOEL\n\nPartner\n\nCatherine SAIRE Partner, Sustainable\n\nDevelopment\n\nC\u00e9line EYDIEU BOUTTE\n\nPartner\n\nEric MUGNIER Partner, Sustainable Development\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting principles\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its subsidiaries  ('the  Group')  published  for  2022,  have  been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),  as  adopted  in  the  European  Union  as  of 31 December 2022.\n\nOn  9  February  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  closed  the consolidated  financial  statements  at  31  December  2022. The  financial  statements  will  not  become  final  until  they have  been  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of shareholders to be held on 21 April 2023.\n\nThe Group did not anticipate any standards or interpretations not mandatorily applicable in 2022.\n\nPublication in April 2021 by the IFRIC of a decision related to IAS  38  'Intangible  Assets'  on  Configuration  or  Customisation Costs  in  a  Cloud  Computing  Arrangement  within  the  frame of a 'Software as a service' contract (SaaS). The application of  this  decision  did  not  have  any  significant  impact  on  the accounts of the Group.\n\n## 1.1. Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with international accounting standards requires that  the  Group  make  a  certain  number  of  estimates  and assumptions that may affect the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, equity and net profit (loss).\n\nThese estimates and  assumptions  mainly  concern  the measurement  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets, operating  lease  terms,  provisions,  non-current  tax  liabilities, pension obligations, deferred taxes and share-based payments.  Estimates  used  by  the  Group  in  relation  to  these different  areas  are  made  based  on  information  available when the accounts are prepared and are described in detail in each specific associated note.\n\n## 1.2. Scope and methods of consolidation\n\nAll companies included in the scope of consolidation have a financial year ending 31 December or close their accounts on that date.\n\nAll  companies  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  the  parent company L'Or\u00e9al have been fully consolidated.\n\nGroup  companies  that  are  jointly  controlled  with  a  limited number of other shareholders under a contractual agreement are  consolidated  under  the  equity  method  in  accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAssociates  over  which  the  Group  has  a  significant  influence have been accounted for by the equity method.\n\n## 1.3. Translation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are  translated at  closing  exchange  rates.  Income  statement  items  are translated at average exchange rates for the year.\n\nThe resulting translation difference attributable to the Group is entered  directly  under  equity  under  the  item Cumulative translation adjustments , while the translation difference attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  is  recognised  under the Non-controlling interests item.\n\n## 1.4. Valuation of goodwill in foreign currencies\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  foreign  companies  is  considered  to form part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign company, and is  therefore  expressed  in  the  entity's  functional  currency and translated  using  the  closing  exchange  rates  in  effect  at the  closing  date.  Goodwill  recorded  before  1  January  2004 continues to be recorded in euros.",

Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation in the cash flow statement\n\nFor 2022, these changes related to Skinbetter Science acquisition.\n\nFor  2021,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Takami  and Youth to the People acquisitions.\n\nFor  2020,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Azzaro-Mugler and Thayers Natural Remedies acquisitions.\n\n## 2.3. Transaction on share capital\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors approved a  strategic  transaction  consisting  of  the  repurchase  by L'Or\u00e9al, as part  of  its share  buyback  programme,  of 22.26 million of its own shares - representing 4% of its capital from Nestl\u00e9. The total price paid to Nestl\u00e9 was \u20ac8.904 billion.\n\nAll  shares  redeemed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  have  been  bought  back  for the express purpose of cancelling them. The transaction had a  marginally  accretive  impact  on  the  diluted  net  earnings per  share  in  2021,  given  that  the  shares  were  repurchased at the end of 2021, but will have a full-year accretive impact of at least 4% for the 2022 financial year.\n\nThis  transaction  led  the  Group  to  take  out  a  bridging  loan of  \u20ac1.9  billion  and  issue  commercial  paper  for  \u20ac2.3  billion, with the  balance  financed  by  the  cash  available  at 31 December 2021. These loans have been fully repaid in 2022.\n\n## 2.4. Other information\n\n## Russia-Ukraine conflict\n\nThis conflict has no material impact on the Group.\n\nThe Group decided to temporarily close all its own stores and directly  operated  counters  in  department  stores  in  Russia as well as suspend all its business and advertising investments in the country.\n\nThe  Group  also  decided  to  temporarily  shut  down  the e-commerce sites of its brands in Russia.\n\nPursuant  to  the  sanctions  introduced  by  the  European  Union and the United States, the Group also suspended the sale of all its products except essential everyday items.\n\n## Sustainability-linked Bond issue\n\nThe  Group issued a \u20ac3 billion  bond  in  three  tranches,  one  of which  was  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac1.25  billion  and  included environmental  (ESG)  criteria  linked  to  the  Group's  CSR performance (note 9.1).",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 3. Operating items - Segment information\n\n## Accounting Principles\n\n## Net sales\n\nNet  sales  are  recognised  when  the  goods  have  been transferred to the customer.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts  and  product  returns  are deducted  from  net  sales,  as  are  incentives  granted  to distributors or consumers resulting in a cash outflow, such as commercial  cooperation,  coupons,  discounts  and  loyalty programmes.\n\nIncentives granted to distributors or consumers  are recognised as a deduction from sales: the service cannot be separated from the product sales transaction or it is not possible to reasonably estimate the fair value of the cost of the service.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts,  provisions  for  returns and  incentives granted  to  customers  are  recorded simultaneously to the recognition of the sales if they can be estimated in a reasonably reliable manner, based mainly on statistics  compiled  from  past  experience  and  contractual conditions.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe  cost  of  goods  sold  consists  mainly  of  the  industrial production  cost  of  products  sold,  the  cost  of  distributing products to customers including freight and delivery costs, either directly or indirectly through  depots,  inventory impairment costs, and royalties paid to third parties.\n\n## Research and innovation expenses\n\nExpenditure  during  the  research  phase  is  charged  to  the income  statement  for  the  financial  year  during  which  it  is incurred.\n\nExpenses incurred during the innovation phase  are recognised  as Intangible  assets only  if  they  meet  all  the following criteria set out in IAS 38:\n\n- \u00b7 the  project  is  clearly  defined  and  the  related  costs  are separately identified and reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical  feasibility of the project has  been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the intention and ability to complete the project and to use  or  sell  the  products  resulting  from  the  project  have been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the resources necessary to complete the project and to use or sell it are available;\n- \u00b7 the  Group  can  demonstrate  that  the  project  will generate  probable  future  economic  benefits,  as  the existence  of  a  potential  market  for  the  production resulting  from  the  project,  or  its  internal  usefulness  has been demonstrated.\n\nIn view of the very large number of innovation projects and uncertainties  concerning  the  decision  to  launch  products relating  to  these  projects,  L'Or\u00e9al  considers  that  some  of these capitalisation criteria are not met.\n\n## Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nThese  expenses  consist  mainly  of  expenses  relating  to  the advertisement and promotion of products to customers and consumers. They are charged to the income statement for the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nThese expenses relate mainly to sales teams and sales team management, marketing teams and administrative services,  as  well  as  general  expenses  and  the  costs  and expenses of free shares.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating  profit  consists  of  gross  profit  less  research  and innovation  expenses,  advertising  and  promotion  expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  on  the balance  sheet  at  their  purchase  price.  They  are  not remeasured.\n\nAssets financed by lease contracts are recognised as assets on  the  balance  sheet  under Right-of-use assets.  The corresponding debt is recognised as a liability under Lease debt .\n\nInvestment subsidies are recorded as liabilities under Other current liabilities .\n\nThe  components  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are recorded  separately  if  their  estimated  useful  lives,  and therefore their depreciation periods, are materially different.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  using  the straight-line method, over the following useful lives:\n\n| Buildings                                       | 10-40 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Industrial machinery and equipment              | 5-15 years    |\n| Point-of-sales advertising: stands and displays | 3 years       |\n| Other property, plant and equipment             | 3-10 years    |\n\nDepreciation  and  impairment  losses  are  recorded  in  the income statement according to the use of the asset.\n\nIn  view of their nature, property, plant and equipment are considered to have a value of zero at the end of the useful lives indicated above.\n\n## Leases\n\nAll leases are recognised using a single model consisting of recording lease liabilities as liabilities (amount of discounted future payments) and rights of use as assets.\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable term of each  contract  and  includes  any  renewal  options  that  the Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise,  particularly  if  the estimated  useful  life  of  the  fittings  in  which  the  Group invested initially or during the lifetime of the contract exceeds the initial contractual life. In the case of termination options subject to a short notice period, these options have not been taken into account in the assessment of the lease terms.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe right of use is amortised over the expected lease term. French lease rights are not amortised.\n\nThe discount rate used to value the lease liability corresponds to the annual rate for each contract calculated using zerocoupon rates obtained by currency and by maturity tranche, increased by the Group's credit spread.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded during the initial recognition.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method.\n\nA  provision is made  for  obsolete  and  slow-moving inventories  on  the  basis  of  their  probable  net  realisable\n\n## 3.1. Segment information\n\n## 3.1.1. Information by business segment\n\nThe Group's business activities are organised into four Divisions. In its markets,  each  Operational  Division  develops  and enhances a range of its own brand of consumer products:\n\n- \u00b7 the Professional Products Division provides expertise to beauty professionals.\n- For  over  100  years,  this  Division  has  acquired  extensive knowledge of, and provided tailored support solutions for, the  hairdressing  sector.  It  has  built  up  a  unique  brand portfolio  which  currently  includes  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel, K\u00e9rastase, Redken, Matrix and PureOlogy;\n- \u00b7 the  Consumer  Products  Division's  goal  is  to  democratise access to the best that the world of beauty has to offer.\n- The  Division  is  underpinned  by  four  major  global  brands (L'Or\u00e9al  Paris, Garnier,  Maybelline  New  York  and  NYX Professional Makeup),  and  by  the  deployment  of  its specialised and regional brands (Stylenanda, Essie, Mixa , etc.);\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al Luxe creates exceptional experiences and products,  for  the  most  demanding  consumers  in  selective distribution.\n\nvalue,  estimated  on  the  basis  of  historic  and  projected data.\n\n## Trade accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable from customers are recorded at their nominal value, which corresponds to their fair value.\n\nThe current trade accounts receivable impairment methodology at L'Or\u00e9al reflects the level of expected losses on the customer portfolio, calculated on the basis of past statistics from the outset of the receivable. Moreover, this risk is  contained  thanks  to  the  credit  insurance  policy  applied by the Group.\n\nExcept when local conditions do not allow it, the Group has insurance cover for the subsidiaries.\n\nThe Division has built a unique portfolio of prestigious brands including  iconic  mainstream,  aspirational,  alternative  and specialist brands (Lanc\u00f4me, Kiehl's, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Yves  Saint  Laurent  Beaut\u00e9,  Biotherm,  Helena  Rubinstein, Shu  Uemura,  IT  Cosmetics,  Urban  Decay,  Ralph  Lauren, Mugler, Viktor&Rolf, Valentino, Azzaro, etc.);\n\n- \u00b7 the  Active  Cosmetics  Division,  whose  goal  is  to  help everyone in their quest to have healthy and beautiful skin. Its portfolio of highly complementary brands (La Roche-Posay, Vichy, CeraVe, SkinCeuticals, etc.) is designed to keep pace with  major  skincare  trends  and  recommendations  of healthcare professionals.\n\nThe  'non-allocated'  item  includes  expenses  incurred  by  the Functional  Divisions,  fundamental  research  and  the  cost  of free  shares  not  allocated  to  the  Divisions.  It  also  includes non-core businesses, such as reinsurance.\n\nThe  performance  of  each  Division  is  measured  on  the  basis of operating profit.\n\n## Weight of net sales by division over the three periods\n\n2022 SALES: \u20ac38,261 M\n\n2021 SALES: \u20ac32,288 M\n\n2020 SALES: \u20ac27,992 M\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Post-employment benefits, termination benefits and other long-term employee benefits\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  Group  operates  pension,  early  retirement  and  other employee benefit schemes depending on local legislation and regulations.\n\nFor obligatory state schemes and other defined-contribution schemes,  the  Group  recognises  in  the  income  statement contributions payable when they are due. No provision has been set aside in this respect as the Group's obligation does not exceed the amount of contributions paid.\n\nThe characteristics of the defined benefit schemes in force within the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 French  regulations  provide  for  specific  length-of-service awards  payable  to  employees  on  retirement.  An  early retirement  plan  and  a  defined  benefit  plan  have  also been set  up.  In  some  Group  companies  there  are  also measures providing for the payment of certain healthcare costs for retired employees. These obligations are partially funded  by  an  external  fund,  except  those  relating  to healthcare costs for retired employees;\n- \u00b7 for foreign subsidiaries with employee retirement schemes or other specific obligations relating to defined benefit  plans,  the  excess  of  the  projected  benefit obligation over the scheme's assets is also recognised by setting  up  a  provision  for  charges  on  the  basis  of  the actuarial value of employees' vested rights.\n\nThe charges recorded in the income statement during the year include:\n\n- \u00b7 additional  rights vested  by  employees  during  the accounting period;\n- \u00b7 the  impact  of  any  change  to  existing  schemes  on previous years or of any new schemes;\n- \u00b7 the change in the value of the discounted rights over the past year;\n- \u00b7 income on external funds calculated on the basis of the discount rate applied to the benefit obligation.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to calculate these obligations take into account the economic conditions specific to each country or Group company. The main weighted average assumptions for the Group are as follows:\n\n| In %                          | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Discount rate (commitment)    | 4.2%         | 1.6%         | 1.1%         |\n| Discount rate (service cost)* | 4.2%         | 1.8%         | 1.4%         |\n| Salary increases              | 3.7%         | 3.6%         | 3.4%         |\n\n|                                        | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022                | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021                | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020                |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n|                                        | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application of final rate |\n| Expected rate of health care inflation | 5.4%         | 4.3%         | 2027                      | 5.3%         | 4.2%         | 2027                      | 5.3%         | 4.2%         | 2027                      |\n\nThe discount rates are obtained by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds having term dates equivalent to those of the obligations.\n\nBond quality is assessed by reference to the AA-/Aa3 minimum rating provided by one of the three main credit-rating agencies.\n\nThe latter two items represent the interest component of the pension costs.  The  interest  component  is  shown  within  Net financial  income  on  the  Other  financial  income  and expenses item.\n\nTo  determine  the  discounted  value  of  the  obligation  for each  scheme,  the  Group  applies  an  actuarial  valuation method  based  on  the  final  salary  (projected  unit  credit method). The obligations and the fair value of plan assets are assessed each  year  using  length-of-service, life expectancy,  staff  turnover  by  category  and  economic assumptions (such as inflation rate and discount rate).\n\nThe  Group  applies  a  simplified  granular  approach  to calculate its service cost for the period. Under this simplified approach,  two  different  discount  rates  are  used  to calculate the obligation and the service cost based on the duration of the future cash flows relating to each of these items.  Financial  costs  are  calculated  by  applying  the discount rate used for the obligation to plan assets and by applying the differential interest rate to service cost for the period.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  on  post-employment defined benefit obligations are recognised in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses in relation to other benefits such as jubilee awards and long-serve bonuses are immediately charged to the income statement.\n\nThe  liability  corresponding  to  the  Company's  net  defined benefit  obligation  regarding  its  employees  is  recorded  in the balance  sheet  on  the  Provisions for employee retirement obligations and related benefits line .",

This number does not include the  subscription  reserved  for  a  Trustee  under  the  laws  of England  and  Wales,  as  part  of  a  Share  Incentive  Plan established  for  Group  employees  in  the  UK,  for  which  the number of shares will be finalised in October 2023.\n\nFor  French  employees,  free  shares  were  offered  upon subscription  in  proportion  to  their  personal  contribution  to the plan with a maximum of 4 shares offered for 10 shares subscribed.\n\nFor employees in other countries, shares were offered under a free  share  plan  with  a  continued  employment  condition  for the employee and proportionate to how much the employee contributes to the plan, with a maximum of 4 shares offered for 10  shares  subscribed.  The  shares  will  be  allocated  to employees  on  26  July  2027  provided  they  are  still  with  the Group on that date.\n\nThe  IFRS  2  expense  measuring  the  benefit  offered  to employees  is  calculated  with  reference  to  the  fair  value  of the discount offered on the non-transferable shares.\n\nThe capital was increased on 26 July 2022 by 448,267 shares, including matching shares.\n\nThe IFRS 2 expense for free shares granted amounted to:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac9.5  million  for  French  employees  based  on  a  subscription price of \u20ac254.90 per share; and\n- \u00b7 \u20ac12.2 million for employees outside of France.\n\nThis cost is amortised over the vesting period and corresponds to  the  share  reference  value  adjusted  for  the  expected dividends over the vesting period, namely \u20ac286.36 per share.\n\nThe  IFRS  2  expense  for  free  shares  recognised  for  the  2022 financial  year  amounted  to  \u20ac13.7  million  and  corresponds  to 2018, 2020 and 2022 plans.\n\nThe IFRS 2 expense amounted respectively to \u20ac9.7 million and \u20ac2.8 million in 2020 and 2021.",

Income tax\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  income  tax  charge  includes  the  current  tax  expense payable by each consolidated tax entity and the deferred tax expense. Deferred tax is calculated whenever there are temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and  their  basis  for  consolidated  accounting purposes, using the balance sheet liability method.\n\nThe  restatement  of  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  lease contracts results in the booking of deferred tax.\n\nDeferred  tax  includes  irrecoverable  taxation  on  estimated or confirmed dividends.\n\nDeferred tax is measured using the tax rate enacted at the closing date and which will also apply when the temporary differences reverse.\n\n## 6.1.

Analysis of tax charge\n\nThe income tax charge may be analysed as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                  | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Profit from continuing operations before tax and associates | 7,610.6 | 6,046.9 | 4,776.5 |\n| Theoretical tax rate                                        | 24.36%  | 24.72%  | 26.37%  |\n| Expected tax charge                                         | 1,853.9 | 1,494.8 | 1,259.7 |\n| Impact of permanent differences                             | 102.7   | 17.3    | 31.4    |\n| Impact of tax rate differences                              | -154.0  | -74.3   | -129.9  |\n| Change in unrecognised deferred taxes                       | 4.1     | 3.5     | 1.7     |\n| Effect of non-current tax liabilities                       | 17.3    | -11.9   | 108.2   |\n| Other (1)                                                   | 75.4    | 16.0    | -61.3   |\n| GROUP TAX CHARGE                                            | 1,899.4 | 1,445.4 | 1,209.8 |\n\nThe expected tax charge reflects the sum of pre-tax profit for each  country,  multiplied  by  the  normal  taxation  rate.  The theoretical tax rate reflects the total expected tax charge as a percentage of pre-tax profit.\n\nThe  impact  of  any  reduced  tax  rates  existing  in  certain countries in addition to the normal tax rates is included on the line Impact of tax rate differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets generated by tax loss carryforwards are only recognised to the extent it is probable that the entities will  be  able  to  generate  taxable  profit  against  which  they can be utilised.\n\nUnder the French system of tax consolidation, the taxable profits of some  French  companies  are  offset  when determining the overall tax  charge,  which  is  payable  only by  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  tax  Group.  Tax consolidation systems also exist outside France.\n\nUncertain tax positions are recorded in the balance sheet under Non-current  tax  liabilities .  These  correspond  to  an estimate of tax risks and litigation related to income tax for the various countries in which the Group operates.",

The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the Company  acquired  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the acquisition date. Any valuation differences identified when the  acquisition  is  carried  out  are  recorded  under  the corresponding asset and liability items.\n\nAny residual difference between the cost of an acquisition and the  Group's  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  identified assets and liabilities is recorded as Goodwill and allocated to the Cash Generating Units expected to benefit from the acquisition or the related synergies.\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  the  acquisition  of  an  associate  is presented in the Investments in associates item.\n\nFor business combinations carried out after 1 January 2010, the  main  changes  with  regard  to  previously  applicable accounting principles are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 for  each  acquisition,  the  Group  chooses  whether  to recognise  the  full  amount  of  goodwill  regardless  of  the ownership  interest  acquired,  or  an  amount  of  goodwill corresponding  to  its  interest  in  the  acquired  company (previously the only method allowed);\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets recognised after the initial accounting is complete are included in profit or loss, and in contrast to previous practices, the amount of goodwill that  would  have  been  recorded  had  the  deferred  tax asset  been  recognised  as  an  identifiable  asset  at  the acquisition date is not deducted;\n- \u00b7 costs  incurred  in  respect  of  a  business  combination  are now expensed and no longer included in the acquisition cost;\n- \u00b7 the acquisition cost, which includes contingent consideration, is recognised and  measured  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value.  Subsequent  changes  in  fair value, affecting in particular the contingent consideration recorded in liabilities, are recognised in Other income and expenses in the income statement and no longer treated as an adjustment to goodwill;\n- \u00b7 any  previous  interest  held  in  the  acquiree  prior  to  the date  control  was  obtained  is  now  remeasured  at  its acquisition-date fair  value,  with  the  corresponding  gain or  loss  on  remeasurement  recognised  on  the  income statement;\n- \u00b7 purchase commitments for minority interests are recognised in financial debt  at  the  acquisition-date  fair  value. Subsequent changes in fair value of the commitment are recognised by adjusting equity.",

Intangible assets identified following an acquisition as well  as  internally  generated  intangible  assets  are  also included in this item.\n\n## a) Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThey  mainly  consist  of  brands,  customer  relationships  and formulas and patents.\n\nWith  regard  to  brands,  the  use  of  the  'discounted  cash flow'  method  is  preferred  to  enable  the  value  in  use  to be  monitored  more  easily  following  the  acquisition. Two approaches have been adopted to date:\n\n- \u00b7 premium-based approach: this method involves estimating the portion of future cash flows that could be generated by the brand, compared with the future cash flows that the activity could generate without the brand;\n- \u00b7 royalty-based  approach:  this  involves  estimating  the value of the brand by referencing the levels of royalties demanded for the  use  of  similar  brands.  It  is  based  on sales forecasts drawn up by the Group.\n\nThese  approaches  are  based  on  a  qualitative  analysis  of the brand in order to ensure that the assumptions selected are  relevant.  The  discount  rate  used  is  based  on  the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  target acquired. Terminal growth  rates  are  consistent with available  market  data  (generally  2.5%  for  Europe  and  3% for the rest of the world, except in specific cases).\n\nA brand may have a finite or an indefinite useful life span.\n\nLocal  brands  which  are  to  be  gradually  replaced  by  an international brand already existing within the Group have a finite useful life span.\n\nThey are amortised over their useful lives as estimated at the date of acquisition.\n\nInternational  brands  are  brands  which  have  an  indefinite life  span.  They  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  once  a year  during  the  fourth  quarter,  and  whenever  an  adverse event occurs.\n\nAdverse  events  may  result  among  other  things  from  an increase  in  market  interest  rates  or  from  a  decrease  in actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit  compared  to forecasts.\n\nThe impairment test consists of calculating the recoverable amount of the brand based on the model adopted when the acquisition took place.\n\nCustomer  relationships  refer  to  relations  developed  with customers  either  through  contractual  arrangements  or  by non-contractual means through constant revenue streams resulting from the target's competitive position or reputation in its market.\n\nThe useful life of a customer relationship is limited and varies depending  on  the  estimated  attrition  rate  of  existing customers at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThe Group may decide to identify and value patents and formulas that it intends to develop.\n\nThe value of a patent or a formula is assessed on the basis of  the  future  profits  expected  from  its  ownership  in  the future, in accordance with the royalty-based approach.\n\nThe amortisation period applicable to patents corresponds to the period during which they enjoy legal protection.\n\n## b) Internally generated intangible assets\n\nThese mainly consist of software.\n\nInnovation costs of software for internal use are capitalised for the programming, coding and testing phases. The costs of substantial updates and upgrades resulting in additional functions are also capitalised.\n\nCapitalised  innovation  costs  are  amortised  from  the  date the software is made available in the entity concerned and over its probable useful life, which, in most cases, is between five and eight years.",

        "page_content": "## 7.3. Impairment tests on intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nGoodwill is not amortised. It is tested for impairment at least once  a  year  during  the  fourth  quarter  or  whenever  an adverse  event  occurs.  Adverse  events  may  result  among other things from an increase in market interest rates or from a  decrease  in  actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit compared to forecasts.\n\nImpairment tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of assets including goodwill and brands with the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit. A Cash Generating  Unit  corresponds  to  one  or  more  worldwide brands. A Cash Generating Unit can contain several brands in  case  of  similar  marketing  position  or  depending  on organisational  criteria  and  particularly  when  distribution circuits and commercial/management  structures are pooled. Recoverable values are determined on the basis of discounted  operating  cash  flow  forecasts  covering  a period of 10 years (the period considered necessary for the strategic positioning of an acquisition) and a terminal value.\n\nThe  cash  flows  are  determined  in  the  currencies  of  the countries  in  question  and  are  translated,  in  the  same  way as the net carrying amounts to which they are compared, at the estimated exchange rate for the following year. The discount  rate  used  for  these  calculations  is  based  on  the weighted average  cost of capital (WACC),  which amounted to 8.8% in 2022, to 7.8% in 2021 and 7.3% in 2020 for  amounts  in  euro,  ad)justed  where  appropriate  by  a country  risk  premium  according  to  the  geographic  zones concerned. The discount rates are post-tax rates applied to post-tax  cash  flows,  and  result  in  recoverable  amounts identical  to  those  obtained  by  applying  pre-tax  rates  to pre-tax  cash  flows.  The  assumptions  adopted  in  terms  of sales  growth  and  terminal  values  are  reasonable  and consistent  with  the  available  market  data  (generally  2.5% for  Europe  and  3%  for  the  rest  of  the  world  for  terminal values except in specific cases).\n\nThe  use  of  discounted  cash  flow  forecasts  is  preferred  in order  to  determine  recoverable  amounts,  unless  details  of similar recent transactions are readily available.\n\nImpairment tests of Cash Generating Units for which the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is significant, are carried out based on the following data and assumptions:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net carrying amount of goodwill and brands with an indefinite useful life |         |         |         |\n| Perfumes                                                                  | 1,842.2 | 1,812.9 | 1,827.7 |\n| L'Or\u00e9al Paris                                                             | 1,235.7 | 1,215.6 | 1,174.8 |\n| Maquillage Mass Market                                                    | 1,109.5 | 1,067.5 | 1,017.5 |\n| SkinCeuticals/Skinbetter Science                                          | 938.2   | 234.7   | 228.3   |\n| Lanc\u00f4me                                                                   | 850.8   | 852.7   | 842.5   |\n| CeraVe                                                                    | 839.0   | 812.5   | 779.8   |\n| Redken/PureOlogy                                                          | 802.4   | 767.2   | 722.1   |\n| IT Cosmetics                                                              | 757.4   | 726.9   | 934.1   |\n| Matrix                                                                    | 755.4   | 720.8   | 675.6   |\n| Skincare Luxe                                                             | 640.4   | 630.7   | 142.8   |\n| YSL Beaut\u00e9                                                                | 536.4   | 536.0   | 535.5   |\n| Stylenanda                                                                | 493.8   | 494.6   | 498.2   |\n| NYX Professional Makeup                                                   | 446.4   | 424.6   | 397.6   |\n| Garnier                                                                   | 436.6   | 493.8   | 471.3   |\n| L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel/K\u00e9rastase                                           | 429.5   | 417.9   | 403.7   |\n| Vichy/Dermablend                                                          | 327.3   | 336.2   | 327.9   |\n| Urban Decay                                                               | 244.1   | 232.4   | 217.8   |\n| Shu Uemura                                                                | 228.3   | 242.9   | 246.2   |\n\nThe discount rate used at 31 December 2022 for this test were between 6.2% and 15.9% including 8.6% for the USA and 8.8% for international.

Financial assets and liabilities - Cost of debt\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Finance costs, net\n\nNet  financial  debt  consists  of  all  current  and  non-current financial borrowings  and  debt,  less  cash  and  cash equivalents.\n\nNet finance costs consist of income and expenses arising on the  items  making  up  net  financial  debt  during  the accounting  period,  including  gains  and  losses  on  the corresponding foreign exchange rate hedges.\n\n## Borrowings and debt\n\nBorrowings  and  debt  are  valued  at  amortised  cost  based on an effective interest rate.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principle  of  fair  value  hedge accounting, fixed-rate borrowings and debt swapped at a floating  rate  are  valued  on  the  balance  sheet  at  market value.  The  resulting  changes  in  value  are  recorded  as finance costs and are offset by changes in the value of the related interest rate swaps.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  is  determined  by  the discounted  cash  flow  method  using  bond  yield  curves  at the closing date, allowing for the spread corresponding to the Group's risk class to be taken into account.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  floating-rate  debt  is  a  reasonable approximation of its fair value.\n\nMedium- and long-term borrowings and debt are recorded under Non-current liabilities. Short-term borrowings and debt as  well  as  the  current  portion  of  medium-  and  long-term borrowings and debt are presented under Current liabilities.\n\n## 9.1. Borrowings and debt\n\nThe  Group  takes  out  bank  loans  to  cover  its  medium-term financing needs and issues short-term marketable instruments in  France  and  commercial  paper  in  the  US  to  cover  its financing  needs  in  the  short  term.  None  of  the  Group's borrowings or debt contains an early repayment clause linked to financial ratios (covenants).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalent\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  in  bank accounts,  units  of  cash  unit  trusts  and  liquid  short-term investments with a negligible risk of changes in value and a maturity  date  of  less  than  three  months  at  the  date  of acquisition.\n\nInvestments  in  shares  and  cash,  which  are  held  in  an account blocked for  more  than  three  months,  cannot  be recorded  under  cash  and  are  presented  under  Other current assets.\n\nBank overdrafts considered to be financing are presented in Current borrowings and debt.\n\nThe  money-market  unit  trusts  are  classified  as  financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. As such, they are valued  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value  at  the closing  date.  Any  related  unrealised  gains  are  accounted for in Finance costs, Net in the income statement.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  bank  deposits  is  a  reasonable approximation of their fair value.\n\n## Non-current financial assets\n\nNon-current financial assets include investments in non-consolidated  companies  and  long-term  loans  and receivables maturing after more than 12 months.\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies are classified as financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income. As such, they are valued on the basis of their fair value,  and  unrealised  losses  and  gains  are  accounted  for through equity on the line Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair value of listed securities is determined on the basis of the share price at the closing date. For unlisted securities, in  the  absence  of  specific  events,  their  acquisition  cost  is deemed to be the best possible estimate of fair value.\n\nLong-term  loans  and  receivables  are  considered  to  be assets generated by the business. As such, they are valued at amortised cost. If there is an indication of a loss in value, a provision for impairment is recorded.\n\nIn  March  2022,  the  Group  conducted  a  bond  issue  totalling \u20ac3  billion.  It  comprised  three  tranches:  a  \u20ac750  million  2-year floating  rate  note;  a  \u20ac1,000  million  2-year  fixed  rate  bond paying  a  coupon  of  0.375%  p.y.;  a  \u20ac1,250  million  4.25-year fixed  rate  Sustainability-Linked  Bond  paying  a  coupon  of 0.875%  p.y.  and  including  environmental  (ESG)  criteria  linked to the Group's internal performance.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 10. Derivatives and exposure to market risks\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  to  hedge  identifiable foreign exchange and interest rate risks are accounted for in accordance with hedge accounting principles.\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and options are put in place  in  order  to  hedge  items  recorded  in  the  balance sheet (fair value hedges) and cash flows on highly probable future commercial transactions (cash flow hedges).\n\nAll foreign exchange hedging instruments are recorded on the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  including  those which relate to purchases and sales in the next accounting period.  Hence changes in the fair value of these hedging instruments  is  recorded  in  shareholders'  equity  and  the amount  accumulated  in  shareholders'  equity  impacts  the result on the date of completion of hedged transactions.\n\nAny remaining hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nThe  Group  may  decide  to  hedge  certain  investments  in foreign  companies.  Exchange  gains  or  losses  relating  to these hedges are directly charged to consolidated equity, under the item Cumulative translation adjustments.\n\nWith regard to interest rate risk, fixed-rate debt and financial loans  hedged  by  interest  rate  swaps  are  valued  in  the balance  sheet  at  their  market  value.  Changes  in  the  fair value  of  these  items  are  recorded  as  finance  costs  and offset  by  adjustments  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related hedging derivatives. Floating-rate debt and financial loans are  valued  at  cost,  which  corresponds  to  their  market value.  The  swaps  or  caps  which  hedge  these  items  are valued  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  with changes in value recorded directly  through  equity  on  the Other comprehensive income item.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  is  their market  value.  This  market  value  is  calculated  by  the discounted cash flow method at the interest rate effective at the closing date.\n\nIn accordance with hedge accounting, unrealised exchange gains and losses relating to unsold inventories are deferred  in  the  inventories  item  in  the  balance  sheet. Similarly, if a currency hedge has been taken out in respect of fixed assets purchased with foreign currency, these assets are  valued  in  the  balance  sheet  on  the  basis  of  the hedging rate.\n\nTo manage its exposure to currency and interest rate risks arising in the course of its normal operations, the Group uses derivatives negotiated with counterparties rated investment grade.\n\nIn accordance with Group rules, currency and interest rate derivatives are set up exclusively for hedging purposes.\n\n## 10.1. Hedging of currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  commercial transactions  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  and  on  highly probable future transactions.\n\nThe Group's policy regarding its exposure to currency risk on future commercial transactions is to hedge, before the end of the  year,  a  large  part  of  the  currency  risk  for  the  following year,  using  derivatives  based  on  operating  budgets  in  each subsidiary.\n\nAll  the  Group's  future  foreign  currency  flows  are  analysed  in detailed  forecasts  for  the  coming  budgetary  year.  Any currency  risks  identified  are  hedged  by  forward  contracts  or options  in  order  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  currency exposure  of  each  subsidiary.  The  term  of  the  derivatives  is aligned with the Group's settlements. Exchange  rate derivatives are negotiated by FINVAL or, in exceptional cases, directly  by  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  Such  transactions  are supervised by the Group's Treasury department.\n\nAs  a  non-financial  corporation,  FINVAL  is  subject  to  the European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulations  (EMIR).  Published by  the  European  Commission  in  September  2012,  EMIR  is aimed at moving OTC markets towards a centralised model, thereby  enhancing  market  transparency  and  regulatory oversight  and  decreasing  systemic  risk  using  a  guarantee mechanism.  As  the  Group's  companies  must  borrow  and invest their cash in their own currency, the exchange rate risks generated by managing their own cash and debt are almost non-existent.\n\nOwing to the Group's policy of currency risk hedging a large part of annual requirements for the following year before the end  of  the  current  year,  the  sensitivity  of  profit  or  loss  to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  at  31  December  is marginal. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the  foreign  exchange  cash  flow  hedges  reserve  is  described in note 11.3.",

Foreign exchange gains and losses also include the following items relating to derivative instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in market value linked to variations in the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the date when the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 residual  ineffectiveness  linked  to  excess  hedges  and recognised  directly  in  the  income  statement  under  other foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  for  \u20ac24.5  million, \u20ac1.5  million  and  \u20ac13.3  million  in  2022,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nThese  amounts  are  allocated  to  the  appropriate  operating expense items. They are broken down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of sales                                | -324.2 |  -37.2 |    6.4 |\n| Research and innovation expenses             |   29.6 |   -4.2 |   -2.1 |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           |  -61.5 |   -5.9 |    1.2 |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses |  -58.7 |   -5.5 |    0.9 |\n| FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES            | -414.7 |  -52.8 |    6.4 |\n\n## 10.3. Hedging of interest rate risk\n\nThe Group did not have any interest rate hedging instruments at 31 December 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 10.4. Sensitivity to changes in interest rates\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have had a  direct  positive  impact  of  \u20ac9.8  million  on  the  Group's  net finance costs at 31 December 2022, compared with a direct negative impact of -\u20ac18.2 million at 31 December 2021 and a direct  positive  impact  of  \u20ac56.4  million  at  31  December  2020. This calculation  allows  for  cash,  cash  equivalents  and derivatives,  and  assumes  that  total  net  debt/cash  remains stable  and  that  fixed-rate  debt  at  maturity  is  replaced  by floating-rate debt.\n\nThe impact of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates on the fair value  of  the  Group's  fixed-rate  financial  assets  and  liabilities, after  allowing  for  any  interest  rate  derivatives,  can  be estimated  at  -\u20ac23.9  million  at  31  December  2022  compared with  -\u20ac1.0  million  at  31  December  2021  and  -\u20ac1.0  million 31 December 2020.",

Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group has financial relations with international banks rated investment  grade  by  specialised  agencies.  The  Group  thus considers that its exposure to counterparty risk is low.\n\nFurthermore,  the  financial  instruments  used  to  manage exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  risk  are  issued  by  leading international banking counterparties.\n\nAccordingly, the Group considers its exposure to counterparty risk to be low.\n\n## 10.6. Liquidity risk\n\nThe  Group's  liquidity  risk  can  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  its outstanding  short-term  debt  under  its  short-term  marketable instruments  programme.  Should  these  bank  facilities  not  be renewed,  the  Group  would  have  confirmed  undrawn  credit lines  of  \u20ac5,000  million  at  31  December  2022.  These  lines  were not subject to any covenants.\n\n## 10.8. Fair value hierarchy\n\nIFRS 7 requires financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the balance sheet to be classified according to three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 level 1: quoted prices on an active market;\n\n## 10.7. Shareholding risk\n\nNo cash has been invested in shares.\n\nAvailable cash is invested with top-ranking financial institutions in  the  form  of  non-speculative  instruments  which  can  be drawn in very short periods. At 31 December 2022, marketable securities consist exclusively of unit trusts (note 9.2.).\n\nAt  31  December  2022,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,621.5 million (note 9.3.).\n\nThe initial share price for Sanofi shares was \u20ac34.12.\n\nThe shares are valued based on their fair value, and unrealised losses  and  gains  are  accounted  for  through  equity  in  the Other comprehensive income item.\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,472.6 million (note 9.3.).\n\nAt  31  December  2020,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac9,304.5 million (note 9.3.).\n\n- \u00b7 level 3: valuation techniques using unobservable inputs.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  an  analysis  of  financial  instruments recorded at fair value on the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n- \u00b7 level 2: valuation techniques using observable inputs;\n\n| \u20ac millions 31 December 2022           | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total fair value   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Assets at fair value                  |           |           |           |                    |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          | -         | 260.9     | -         | 260.9              |\n| Sanofi shares                         | 10,621.5  | -         | -         | 10,621.5           |\n| Other securities                      | 99.7      | -         | 391.6     | 491.3              |\n| Marketable securities                 | 718.5     | -         | -         | 718.5              |\n| TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE            | 11,439.7  | 260.9     | 391.6     | 12,092.2           |\n| Liabilities at fair value             |           |           |           |                    |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          | -         | 170.6     | -         | 170.6              |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE       | -         | 170.6     | -         | 170.6              |\n| \u20ac millions                            |           |           |           |                    |\n| 31 December 2021 Assets at fair value | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total fair value   |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          |           | 67.6      |           | 67.6               |\n| Sanofi shares                         | 10,472.6  |           |           | 10,472.6           |\n| Other securities                      | 34.5      |           | 276.9     | 311.4              |\n| Marketable securities                 | -         |           |           | -                  |\n| TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE            | 10,507.1  | 67.6      | 276.9     | 10,851.6           |\n| Liabilities at fair value             |           |           |           |                    |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          |           | 240.4     |           | 240.4              |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE       | -         | 240.4     | -         | 240.4              |",

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities resulting from foreign exchange and/or interest rate hedging transactions entered into with the Group's  counterparty  banks  are  not  offset  in  the  balance sheet since they are FBF (French Banking Federation) or ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements that only provide for offsetting in the event of default by one of  the  parties  to  the  agreement.  Accordingly,  they  do  not meet the offsetting criteria set out in IAS 32.\n\nHad  the  agreements  been  offset  at  the  level  of  each counterparty bank, assets and liabilities would have decreased  by  \u20ac156.7  million,  \u20ac62.7  million  and  \u20ac75.5  million respectively in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 10.10. Sanofi dividends\n\nIn  addition  to  the  \u20ac3.33  per  share  annual  cash  dividend awarded by Sanofi, which amounted to \u20ac393.7 million for the L'Or\u00e9al Group, Sanofi paid an extraordinary dividend in kind.\n\nThe  Sanofi  group  decided  to  list  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary Euroapi  on  the  stock  exchange  on  6  May  2022  and  to distribute 58% of its Euroapi shares to its shareholders.\n\nConsequently,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  received  5,140,317  Euroapi shares  amounting  to  \u20ac74.5  million,  which  was  recognised  as financial income.",

Contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is party to several material disputes, described below:\n\n## 12.2.1. Tax disputes\n\n## Brazil - IPI indirect tax base challenged\n\nIn  January  2015,  decree  8.393/2015  stated  that  commercial companies in Brazil would be liable for the indirect IPI tax on certain products as from 1 May 2015. L'Or\u00e9al is challenging the legal  grounds  of  this  decree  and  its  application.  In  light  of changes in market practices and a favourable change in the opinion  of  its  advisers,  since  1  January  2018  L'Or\u00e9al  has recognised the IPI collected under income.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding  the indirect  IPI  tax  for  financial  years  2008  and  2011  to  2015 totalling  \u20ac631  million,  including  interest  and  penalties.  The Brazilian tax authorities are questioning the ex-works sales price to  the  commercial  arm  used  to  calculate  the  IPI  tax  base. After consulting with its tax advisors, L'Or\u00e9al considers that the Brazilian tax authorities' position is unfounded  and  has challenged these notices. L'Or\u00e9al continues its legal proceedings with the tax and legal authorities.\n\nIn  light  of  the  negative  developments  in  administrative  court decisions  on  the  same  matter  for  other  Brazilian  groups, L'Or\u00e9al  funded  a  provision  for  \u20ac42  million  to  partially  cover this risk.\n\n## India - Advertising, marketing and promotional costs challenged\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  several  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding financial  years  2007/08  to  2017/18  and  2019/20  for  the  most part concerning the tax deductibility of advertising, marketing and promotional expenses for a total amount of \u20ac204 million including  interest  and  penalties.  After  consulting  with  its  tax advisors,  L'Or\u00e9al  decided  to  contest  these  notices  and continues  the  legal  proceedings  with  the  administrative  and legal authorities.\n\n## Mutual agreement procedures\n\nMutual  agreement  procedures  were  instigated vis-\u00e0-vis the Italian,  French,  Indonesian  and  Singaporean  tax  authorities in order to eliminate double taxation following disagreements between these authorities.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 12.2.2. Investigations carried out by the competition authorities\n\nThe  national  competition  authorities  in  several  European countries have launched investigations targeting the cosmetics industry in particular.\n\n## a) Europe (excluding France)\n\nIn Greece, in its decision passed down on 4 October 2017, the Greek competition authority condemned L'Or\u00e9al Hellas to pay a  fine  of  \u20ac2.6  million  for  carrying  out  anti-competitive practices in 2005-2006. L'Or\u00e9al Hellas refuted all allegations of having  engaged  in  anti-competitive  practices  with  other luxury  cosmetics  manufacturers.  The  Greek  Administrative Court of Appeal quashed this decision on 5 November 2018. The  Greek  competition  authority  lodged  an  appeal  in cassation  against  this  decision  on  28  January  2019  and  a hearing before the Council of State, which was postponed on numerous  occasions,  was  finally  held  on  17  November  2020. The  decision  should  be  handed  down  in  the  course  of  the first-half of 2023.\n\nIn  Germany,  after  the  German  competition  authority  filed  a lawsuit  in  2008  in  the  area  of  personal  care  products,  which was  definitively  closed  in  2015,  distributors  filed  a  lawsuit seeking damages against L'Or\u00e9al Germany which has resulted in dismissals by the courts at this stage. These proceedings are still ongoing. L'Or\u00e9al Germany is contesting the merits of these claims and denies that any damages occurred.\n\n## b) France\n\nIn  France,  on  18  December  2014,  the  French  competition authority handed down a fine of \u20ac189.5 million against L'Or\u00e9al in  the  hygiene  products  sector  for  events  that  took  place  in the early 2000s. On 27 October 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal upheld this first instance decision. L'Or\u00e9al refutes all accusations  of  concerted  practices  with  its  competitors  and regrets that the French competition authority did not take into account  the  highly  competitive  French  market  in  household and  hygiene  products  as  illustrated  by  the  number  of manufacturers and retailers present on the market, the large choice  of  products  available  to  consumers,  and  the  high degree of innovation and number of product launches.\n\nFollowing an appeal lodged by L'Or\u00e9al, on 27 March 2019, the Court  of  Cassation  partially  overturned  the  ruling  relating  to the amount of the fine imposed on L'Or\u00e9al. On 18 June 2020, the  Second Court of Appeal confirmed the initial amount of the  fine.  L'Or\u00e9al  lodged  a  second  appeal  with  the  Court  of Cassation  against  this  ruling.  The  decision  should  be  handed down down in the course of the first-half of 2023.\n\n- It  should  be  noted  that  since  the  appeal  and  Cassation appeal  do  not  entail  a  stay  in  the  judgement,  the  fine provisioned at the end of 2014 was paid on 28 April 2015.\n- At  31  December  2022,  the  provision  was  maintained  in liabilities and the payment recognised in Other current assets.\n\nFollowing this ruling, the distributors filed lawsuits for damages against  L'Or\u00e9al.  These  proceedings  are  in  initial  stages  or resulted in dismissals by the courts. These proceedings are still ongoing.  L'Or\u00e9al  contests  the  merits  of  these  claims  and denies that any damages occurred.\n\nA provision has been set aside for all disputes still in progress at 31  December  2022  amounting  to  \u20ac192.2  million  at  year-end unchanged from the provision at end-2021 and end-2020.\n\nAt the present time, no other exceptional events or disputes are highly likely to have a material impact on the earnings, financial situation, assets, or operations of the Company or the L'Or\u00e9al Group.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 13. Sustainable development and the climate\n\n## 13.1. Measurement of assets and liabilities\n\n## a) Environmental risks\n\nThe Group strictly complies with regulations and laws relating to  environmental  protection,  and  does  not  expect  current regulations  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  the  Group's operations, financial position, earnings or assets.\n\n## b) Measurement of assets\n\nFor  many  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to environmental,  social  and  societal  responsibility.  L'Or\u00e9al placed  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  its  strategy,  with  the launch in 2013 of the Sharing Beauty With All programme with 2020  targets  focused  on  sustainable  production,  sustainable innovation, sustainable consumption and shared growth.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  phase  of  its commitments to sustainable development, under the umbrella of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  with  a  new  set  of particularly  ambitious and concrete targets for 2030, in order to  cover  all  the  impacts  associated  with  its  value  chain:  its production and distribution sites as well as its supply chains and the impacts associated with the use of products by consumers.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group undertakes to reach \"carbon neutrality \" for all Group  sites  by  2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and using 100% renewable energy; (1)\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  100%  of  ingredients  in  formulas  and  biobased packaging  materials  will  be  traceable  and  come  from sustainable  sources.  None  of  them  will  contribute  to deforestation;\n- \u00b7 by 2030, 100% of the plastics used in packaging will be from either recycled or biobased sources;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  undertakes  to  innovate  to  enable  its consumers to reduce by 25%, on average and per finished product,  the  water  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions linked to the use of its products, compared to 2016.\n\nThe  above  commitments do not jeopardise the value of the Group's  assets  or  the  useful  lives  of  our  non-financial  assets. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 our  ongoing  efforts  to  bring  our  products  in  line  with consumer  demand  as  part  of L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future are included  in  the  Group's  short-term  strategic  plans  used  in impairment  tests  on  intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite useful life;\n- \u00b7 to date, the adaptation of our plants and product formulas has  not  led  us  to  identify  any  risk  of  our  production  lines becoming  obsolete  or  experiencing  a  reduction  in  their value in use.\n\n## 13.2. Financing, investments and compensation\n\nThe  Group's L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  rests  on  its financing, short- and long-term investment and compensation strategies.\n\n## a) Financing\n\nThe credit lines indexed to the Group's sustainable development  performance  incorporate  a  borrowing  cost adjustment mechanism.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  has  a  syndicated  loan  from  19  banks (\u20ac5 billion), which had not been used at the end of December 2022. This loan incorporates a mechanism whereby the margin is  adjusted  in  line  with  the  Group's  performance  with  regard to  four  ESG  KPIs:  climate,  biodiversity,  resources  and  social commitment.\n\nThe  Group issued a \u20ac3 billion  bond  in  three  tranches,  one  of which a \u20ac1,250 million 4.25-year fixed rate Sustainability-Linked Bond  included  environmental  (ESG)  criteria  linked  to  the Group's CSR performance (note 9.1).\n\n## b) Short-term investment\n\nThe  Group's  available  cash  is  mainly  invested  in  SRI  SICAV money-market funds (40% of all short-term investment in 2022) and term accounts (60% of all short-term investment in 2022).\n\n## c) Long-term investment\n\nThe  Group  recorded  a  total  of  \u20ac157  million  in  non-current financial assets related to sustainable development activities, measured at fair value through equity (note 9.3).\n\n- \u00b7 at the end of 2021, investment in Circular Innovation Fund amounting  to  \u20ac50  million.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  one  of  the  main contributors to this impact investing fund, whose investment thesis is focused  on  seven  verticals including new packaging  materials  and  solution  from  bioeconomy  and the  circular  economy,  green  technology  and  waste  and recycling collection services.\n- \u00b7 in  2020, the creation of a fund for Nature Regeneration to financially support projects to restore natural marine, forest and agricultural ecosystems. This dedicated \u20ac60 million fund had already invested in three projects at the end of 2022.\n- \u00b7 investment  in  start-ups  (\u20ac42  million  in  total),  including  the Swiss environmental technology firm Gjosa, which developed  innovative  water  saving  solutions,  the  French biotech company Global Bioenergies, which developed a process  to  convert  plant-based  resources,  the  green chemistry  start-up  Carbios,  which  developed  enzymatic processes for plastic biodegradation and biorecycling and the French biotech Microphyt which developped a process with a low carbon impact to produce microalgae.",

|\n\n## Revenue recognition: estimate of items deducted from revenue\n\nSee Note 3 'Accounting principles - Revenue' to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nYour Group's revenue is presented net of product returns and discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to distributors or consumers (such as commercial  cooperation)  as  described  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese various deductions from the revenue are recorded simultaneously upon the recognition of sales on the basis, in particular, of contractual conditions and statistical data from past experience.\n\nThus, the valuation of revenue includes, at the end of the financial year, estimates related to the amounts deducted, which we considered to be (i) complex,  due  to  the  diversity  of  contractual  agreements  and commercial conditions  existing  in  the  different  markets  of  your  Group, (ii)  sensitive,  revenue  being  a  key  indicator  in  the  evaluation  of  your Group's performance and its management, and (iii) material in relation to their impact in the financial statements.\n\nThe evaluation of product returns, discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to customers constitutes a key audit matter.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of your Group's accounting principles relating  to  the  recognition  of  product  returns,  discounts,  rebates  and other benefits granted to customers, in accordance with IFRS.\n\nWe  took  note  of  the  internal  control  system  put  in  place  in  the commercial entities of your Group, allowing to evaluate and record the items deducted from the revenue, especially at closing, and we tested, by sampling, the main controls of this system.\n\nSubstantial  tests  were  also  carried  out  to  assess  the  reasonableness  of the product returns and customer benefits estimate.\n\nThese tests specifically included:\n\n- \u25cf Analyzing  the  valuation  methods  used,  in  particular,  by  critically examining  the  assumptions  used,  checking  the  permanence  of  the methods and analyzing the anteriority and unwinding of the previous financial year provisions;\n- \u25cf Reconciling  the  statistical  data  from  the  past  experience  and contractual conditions with data contained in the information systems dedicated to the management of commercial conditions;\n- \u25cf Verifying the arithmetic accuracy  of  the  calculation  of  the corresponding entries (including the residual commitment at closing), their  recording  in  the  accounts  and  their  presentation  in  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of provisions for tax risks and uncertain tax positions\n\nSee Note 6 'Income Taxes ' and Note 12

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses  the  appropriateness  of  Management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the  direction, supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de  la  profession  de  commissaire  aux  comptes ).  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 17, 2023 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nDELOITTE & ASSOCIES\n\nDavid DUPONT-NOEL\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nC\u00e9line EYDIEU-BOUTT\u00c9",

The  total  price  paid  to  Nestl\u00e9  was  \u20ac8.904  billion. These shares were cancelled in the financial year 2022 in line with the decision of the Board of Directors on 9 February 2022.\n\nFurthermore,  this  transaction  led  the  Group  to  take  out  a bridging loan of \u20ac1.9 billion and to issue commercial paper for \u20ac2.3 billion,  with  the  balance financed by the cash available at  31  December  2021.  This  \u20ac1.9  billion  loan  was  repaid  in  full during the 2022 financial year.\n\n## NOTE 1. Accounting principles\n\nThe  Company's  annual  financial  statements  are  prepared in  accordance  with  French  law  and  regulations,  as  set  out in  Regulation  ANC  2014-03  (French  Chart  of  Accounts)  and generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The  accounts  for the  2022  financial  year  were  prepared  and  approved  on  a going concern basis.\n\n## 1.1. Sales\n\nThese are comprised of sales of goods (net of returns, rebates and discounts) and services (including technological assistance fees).\n\n## Other events\n\nIn  March  2022,  the  Group  issued  a  \u20ac3  billion  bond  in  three tranches, of which a \u20ac1,250 million tranche with environmental (ESG) criteria linked to the Group's CSR performance.\n\nIn  July  2022,  the  Travel  Retail  Asia  business  historically  carried by  L'Or\u00e9al  Hong  Kong  was  transferred  to  L'Or\u00e9al  Singapore. L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  backed  L'Or\u00e9al  Singapore  in  its  acquisition of  the  business  via  a  share  capital  increase  in  the  amount of \u20ac6.4 billion. In addition, following the transfer of the business, L'Or\u00e9al  Hong  Kong  generated  a  profit  of  \u20ac6.8  billion, which was immediately transferred to L'Or\u00e9al S.A. in the form of an exceptional dividend.\n\n## 1.2. Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nExpenses  relating  to  the  advertisement  and  promotion of  products  to  customers  and  consumers  are  recognised as  expenses  for  the  year  in  which  the  advertisement  or promotional initiative takes place.\n\n## 1.3. Research and innovation costs\n\nResearch  and  innovation  costs  are  recognised  in  expenses in he period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 1.4. Loan issue costs\n\nIssuance  costs  of  borrowings  are  expensed  immediately  in the year in which they are incurred.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5. Income tax\n\nThe  Company  has  opted  for  the  French  tax  group  regime. French companies included in the scope of tax consolidation recognise an income tax charge in their own accounts on the basis of their own taxable profits and losses.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, as the parent company of the tax group, recognises as  tax  income  the  difference  between  the  aggregate  tax charges recognised by the subsidiaries and the tax due on the basis of consolidated taxable profit or loss of the tax group.\n\n## 1.6. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at purchase cost, including acquisition costs.\n\nTechnical  merger  losses  are  allocated  to  the  corresponding underlying assets and amortised where appropriate.\n\nThe value of newly acquired trademarks is calculated based on  a  multi-criteria  approach  taking  into  consideration  their reputation and their future contribution to profits.\n\nIn  accordance with regulation No. 2004-06 on assets, certain trademarks  have  been  identified  as  amortisable  regarding their estimated useful life.\n\nNon-amortisable trademarks are tested for impairment at least once a year on the basis of the valuation model used at the time  of  their  acquisition.  An  impairment  is  recorded  where appropriate.  Initial  trademark  registration  costs  are  recorded as expenses.\n\nPatents  are  amortised  over  a  period  ranging  from  2  to 10 years.\n\nBusiness goodwill is not amortised. It is impaired whenever the present value of future cash flows is less than the book value. Business  goodwill  is  subject  to  impairment  tests  at  least  once a year, even when there is no evidence of an impairment loss\n\nSoftware of material value is  amortised  using  the  straight-line method  over  its  probable  useful  life,  generally  between five and eight years. It is also subject to accelerated tax-driven amortisation, which is recognised over a 12-month period.\n\nOther intangible assets are usually amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years.\n\n## 1.7. Tangible assets\n\nTangible  assets  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost,  including acquisition expenses.\n\nThe useful lives of tangible assets are as follows:\n\n|                                    | Length      |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Buildings                          | 20-50 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings              | 5-10 years  |\n| Industrial machinery and equipment | 10 years    |\n| Other tangible assets              | 3-10 years  |\n\nBoth  straight-line and  declining-balance  depreciation  is calculated  over  the  actual  useful  lives  of  the  assets concerned. Exceptionally, industrial machinery and equipment is depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  of 10 years, with all additional depreciation classified as accelerated tax-driven depreciation. Exceptional depreciation may  be  recognised  where  events  and  circumstances  lead to a review of the asset's useful life.\n\n## 1.8. Financial assets\n\n## 1.8.1. Equity investments\n\nThese items are recognised in the balance sheet at purchase cost excluding incidental expenses.\n\nTheir  value  is  assessed  annually  by  reference  to  their  value in  use,  which  is  mainly  based  on  the  current  and  forecast profitability  of  the  subsidiary  concerned  and  the  share  of shareholders' equity owned. If the value in use falls below the net book value, an impairment is recognised.\n\n## 1.8.2. Other financial assets\n\nLoans  and  other  receivables  are  valued  at  their  nominal amount. Loans and other receivables denominated in foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing at the end of the financial year. If necessary, impairments are recognised  against  these  items  to  reflect  their  value  in  use at the end of the financial year.\n\nTreasury shares acquired  in connection  with  buyback programmes to be cancelled is recognised in other long-term investments.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, other long-term investments are compared with their probable sale price and a provision for impairment recognised where appropriate.\n\n## 1.9. Inventories\n\nInventories  are  valued  using  the  weighted  average  cost method.  At  the  end  of  each  accounting  period,  obsolete and  slow-moving  inventories  are  written  down  in  the  amount corresponding to the difference between their gross value and their probable net realisable value, on the basis of historical and forecast data, if the latter is lower than the gross value.\n\n## 1.10. Trade accounts receivable and other receivables\n\nTrade accounts receivable and other receivables are recorded at  their  nominal  value.  Where  appropriate,  an  impairment  is recognised based on an assessment of the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## 1.11. Marketable securities cash and cash equivalents\n\nMarketable  securities  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost  and are valued at the end of the financial year at their probable sale price.\n\nTreasury shares held that is specifically allocated to employee stock option and free shares plans recognised in marketable securities.\n\nNo  discount  is  granted  on  the  exercise  price  of  the  options. Provided that the shares are purchased at a lower price than the  exercise  price,  no  impairment  is  required.  However, an impairment is recognised in the event of a decline in the market price,  representing  the  difference  between  the  book value  of  the  treasury  shares  and  the  average  share  price  in the month preceding the reporting date.\n\nA  provision  for  liabilities  and  charges  in  respect  of  shares  of Treasury  shares  allocated  to  free  share  plans  for  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A. parent  company  employees  is  recognised  over  the  period during  which  the  rights  to  the  free  shares  vest.  Shares  of Treasury  shares  allocated  to  free  share  plans  for  employees of  Group  subsidiaries  are  written  down  in  full.  However, the  subsidiaries  concerned  will  bear  most  of  the  cost  of granting these free shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recognised  to  cover probable outflows of resources to third parties, without receipt of  equivalent  consideration  by  the  Company.  They  mainly concern risks  and  disputes  of  a  commercial,  financial,  tax  or social nature (see note 18).\n\nThe  estimated  amount  included  in  provisions  corresponds  to the  outflow  of  resources  that  the  Company  is  likely  to  incur in  the  settlement  of  its  obligation.  Depending  on  the  type  of provision,  the  estimate  takes  account  of  the  most  probable assumptions of realisation, or is assessed in line with statistical methods.\n\nContingent liabilities are potential obligations arising from past events,  whose  existence  will  only  be  confirmed  by  the occurrence  of  future  (uncertain)  events  that  are  not  wholly within  the  control  of  the  Company  or  probable  liabilities  for which  the  outflow  of  resources  is  also  not  within  its  control. Contingent  liabilities  are  not  recognised  and  are  disclosed where applicable.\n\n## 1.13. Accounting for foreign currency transactions and exchange rate hedges\n\nAll receivables, payables, loans and borrowings denominated in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  on  the  balance  sheet  at the exchange rate prevailing as of the reporting date for the financial year. These exchange rate variations, as well as those linked to the hedging instruments taken out to cover the said receivables,  payables,  loans  and  borrowings  denominated in foreign currencies, are recorded in the balance sheet under the heading 'Unrealised exchange losses/gains'.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  if  the  sum  of  these  unrealised exchange  gains  and  losses  shows  a  potential  exchange loss based on the overall exchange position, calculated on a currency-by-currency  basis.  The  overall  foreign  exchange position excludes translation differences of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nIn accordance  with  French  accounting  standards,  the potential  gain  resulting  from  the  overall  foreign  exchange position is not recognised as income in the income statement.\n\nExchange rate hedging instruments are contracted to hedge commercial  transactions  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet and  future  transactions  that  are  considered  to  be  highly probable.  Gains  and  losses  generated  by  these  instruments are recognised symmetrically with the gains and losses arising on  the  hedged  items,  in  the  same  aggregate  as  profit and  loss.  Option  premium  income/discounts  are  recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item is recognised.\n\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified as isolated  open  positions.  These  are  recognised  at  their  fair value  in  the  balance  sheet,  and  offset  an  'Unrealised exchange gains or losses' account.\n\nHedges have already been taken out in respect of forecasted operating transactions for the next financial year. The impact of  such  hedges  on  profit  or  loss  will  be  recorded  during  the same accounting period as the transactions hedged.\n\n## 1.14. Accounting for interest rate instruments\n\nIn the case of interest-rate hedges, for gains and losses arising on  interest  rate  swaps  and  caps,  hedging  financial  liabilities are recorded on a pro rata basis symmetrically with the gains and losses on the items hedged.\n\n## 1.15. Employee retirement obligations and related benefits\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al parent company operates pension, early retirement and  other  benefit  schemes  for  employees  and  retirees depending  on  local  legislation  and  regulations.  Directors  and corporate officers are regarded as employees for all additional benefits  relating  to  their  remuneration,  and  are  therefore covered by the same employee benefit schemes.\n\nThese obligations are partially funded by an external scheme where  the  funds  are  gradually  built  up  through  contributions paid.  The  contributions  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  the Other purchases and external charges item.\n\nThe  related  obligations  are  measured  using  an  actuarial valuation  method  based  on  final  salaries.  The  method  takes account  of  length  of  service,  life  expectancy,  turnover  by category  of  personnel  and  economic  assumptions  such  as inflation  and discount rates. The Company has opted for the new method provided by recommendation ANC 2013-02 on the  accounting  treatment  of  pension  obligations  and  similar benefits  as  amended  on  5  November  2021.  That  is  to  say, the increase in the obligation for each employee is no longer recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  his  or  her  term of  employment  but  straight-line  only  over  the  vesting  period for his or her benefit rights.\n\nNo  provision  is  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  for  net unfunded obligations. These thus appear as off-balance sheet commitments.\n\nOnly  obligations  in  respect  of  long-service  awards  are  no longer  recognised  as  an  off-balance  sheet  commitment; instead, a provision is recognised in the balance sheet based on an actuarial valuation of the obligation.\n\n## NOTE 2.

No  performance  condition  applies  below  a  block of 200 shares.\n\n- \u00b7 For the 13 October 2022 plan, the performance conditions comprise the following:\n- \u00b7 80% of financial performance criteria, of which half is the growth of comparable cosmetics sales for the 2023, 2024 and  2025  financial  years  compared  to  a  panel  of competitors,  and  the  other  half  is  the  change  in  the Group's  consolidated  operating  profit  over  the  period. The  calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the arithmetic  average  of  the  performances  for  2023,  2024 and 2025;\n- \u00b7 20% of non-financial performance criteria, of which 15% is linked  to  the  achievement  of  environmental  and  social responsibility  commitments  made  by  the  Group  as  part of  the  'L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future'  programme,  and  5%  is linked  to  gender  equality  in  strategic  positions  including those of the Executive Committee.\n\nNo performance condition applies below a block of 100 shares. The  plans  of  20  April  2016,  20  April  2017  and  17  April  2018 were  finally  granted  by  the  allocation  of,  respectively, 835,600 shares on 21 April 2020, 742,276 shares on 21 April 2021 and 868,225 shares on 19 April 2022.\n\n## Notes to the financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the performance conditions of the plans in progress were deemed achieved.\n\nIn  June  2022,  Group  employees  had  the  opportunity  to  join a Shareholding Plan based on a traditional format with discount and matching contribution.\n\nThe  subscription  price  was  set  at  \u20ac254.9,  representing  80% of  the  average  share  price  over  the  20  trading  sessions  prior to  the  decision  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  setting  the subscription  period  from  8  June  to  22  June  2022  during which  410,943  shares  were  subscribed.  This  number  does  not include the subscription reserved for a Trustee under the laws of  England  and  Wales,  as  part  of  a  Share  Incentive  Plan established for Group employees in the UK, for which the final number of shares will only be known in October 2023.\n\nFor French  employees,  free  shares  were  offered  upon subscription in proportion to their personal contribution to the plan  with  a  maximum  of  4  shares  offered  for  10  shares subscribed.\n\nFor  employees  in  other  countries,  shares  were  offered  under a  free  share  plan  with  a  continued  employment  condition for  the  employee  and  proportionate  to  how  much  the employee contributes to the plan, with a maximum of 4 shares offered  for  10  free  shares.  The  shares  will  be  allocated  to employees  on  26  July  2027  provided  they  are  still  with  the Group on that date.\n\nThe  share  capital  increase  took  place  on  26  July  2022  for a total of 448,267 shares, including subscribed shares.\n\n## NOTE 18.

Borrowings and debt\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  obtains  financing  through  medium-term  bond  loans and  issues  short-term  marketable  instruments  in  France  and the  United  States.  The  amounts  of  the  programmes  are \u20ac5,000  million  and  $5,000  million  respectively.  None  of  the Group's  borrowings  or  debt  contains  an  early  repayment clause linked to financial ratios (covenants).\n\nLiquidity on the short-term marketable instruments issues is provided by  confirmed  undrawn  short-term  credit  facilities  with  banks, which  amounted  to  \u20ac5,000  million  at  31  December  2022, compared  to  \u20ac5,000  million  at  31  December  2021  and \u20ac5,363 million at 31 December 2020.\n\nIn March 2022, the Group completed a bond issue in the total amount  of  \u20ac3  billion.  It  is  composed  of  three  tranches. A  first  floating  rate  tranche  with  a  maturity  of  2  years  in the  amount  of  \u20ac750  million.  A  second  fixed  rate  tranche with  the  same  maturity  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac1,000  million, with a coupon of 0.375% per annum. A third fixed rate tranche with  a  maturity  of  4  years  3  months  in  the  amount  of \u20ac1,250  million,  with  a  coupon  of  0.875%  per  annum,  known as a sustainability linked bond.\n\nAll borrowings and debt are denominated in euros and can be broken down as follows:\n\n## Breakdown by type of debt\n\n| \u20ac millions                                               | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Bonds (1)                                                | 3,014.5      | -            | -            |\n| Short-term marketable instruments (2)                    | 795.2        | 2,507.0      | 360.0        |\n| Bank overdrafts and financing with the Group's cash pool | -            | -            | -            |\n| Other borrowings and debt (3)                            | 62.4         | 2,439.5      | 9.3          |\n| TOTAL                                                    | 3,872.1      | 4,946.50     | 369.3        |\n\n## Breakdown by maturity date\n\n| \u20ac millions        | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Less than 1 year  | 866.8        | 4,939.8      | 361.7        |\n| 1 to 5 years      | 3,005.3      | 6.7          | 7.6          |\n| More than 5 years | -            | -            | -            |\n| TOTAL             | 3,872.1      | 4,946.5      | 369.3        |\n\n## Average interest rate on borrowings and debt\n\nAs was the case in previous years, drawdowns of short-term marketable instruments denominated in euros were made on the basis of negative rates in 2022.\n\nThus for 2022, the average rate of the debt in euros was +0.26% including bonds, compared to -0.51% in 2021 and -0.31% in 2020, and the average rate of short-term marketable instruments in dollars in the United States stands at 2.18%.\n\n## NOTE 20.

Subsequent events\n\nL'Or\u00e9al S.A. wishes to implement  a  simplification  and streamlining  of  its  organisation  in  order  to  provide  a  better operating  method  for  its  activities  in  France.  This  proposed reorganisation  consists  in  particular  of  spinning  off  certain  of L'Or\u00e9al S.A.'s operational activities, hosting them in dedicated structures in order to give them their autonomy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  S.A.'s  Board  of  Directors  meeting  of  9  February  2023 approved  two  proposed  partial  asset  contributions,  taking account of social and environmental issues in particular.\n\nThese transactions consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 a  contribution  to  L'Or\u00e9al  France  of  the  complete  and autonomous  branches  of  activities  (i)  Affaires  March\u00e9 France  (marketing  activity  on  the  French  market  for products from the Group's four Divisions - Products Grand Public  France,  Produits  Professionnels  France,  Luxe  France and Cosm\u00e9tique Active France), (ii) Domaines d'Excellence (services  activity  for  subsidiaries  based  in  France,  carried out  by  central  services  and  support  functions)  and  (iii)  all shares  comprising  the  capital  of  Luxury  of  Retail,  a  wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;\n- \u00b7 a  contribution  to  L'Or\u00e9al  International  Distribution  of  the complete  and  autonomous  branch  of  the  International Distribution  activity  (operating  the  brands  of  the  four Divisions  in  countries  where  the  brands  are  not  marketed by  the  Company's  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  globally  driving the distribution network).\n\nThe  completion  date  of  these  contributions  will  be  set  at 1  July  2023,  subject  to  extension  until  31  December  2023 at the latest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  report  should  be  read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'OREAL\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting  we  have  audited  the  accompanying financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial  position  of  the Company  as  at  December  31,  2022  and  of  the  results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with  French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the Statutory  Auditors'  Respon0sibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  the  independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ) for the period January 1, 2022 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments -  Key Audit matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.  823-9  and  R.  823-7  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments and intangible assets (excluding software and assets in progress)\n\nSee notes Accounting principles 1.6 - Intangible assets and 1.8.1 - Investments, note 11 - Intangible assets, note 14 - Financial fixed assets and note 30 - List of subsidiaries and investments, to the notes to the financial statements\n\n| Risk identified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Our response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At  December  31,  2022,  investments  and  intangible  assets  (excluding software  and  assets  in  progress)  were  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet for a net book value of \u20ac 17 billion and \u20ac 4.3 billion, respectively, i.e. 84% of the balance sheet total.

They mainly concern risks and disputes of a commercial and financial nature, as  well  as  risks  with  administrations  and  related  to  personnel.  They  are estimated taking into account the most probable assumptions or using statistical methods depending on the nature of the provisions.\n\nThe significant provisions concern in particular the situation of litigation with  the  competition  authority  and  the  risks  with  the  administrations mentioned in Note 18 to the financial statements .\n\nProvisions for liabilities and  charges  amounted  to  M\u20ac  597  at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe identification and assessment of these elements is considered to be a key audit matter given:\n\n- \u25cf the high level of Management judgment required to determine the risks to be provisioned and to assess with sufficient reliability the amounts to be provisioned;\n- \u25cf the potentially material impact of these provisions on the Company's earnings.\n\nIn order to identify and obtain an understanding of all existing disputes and liabilities, as well as the related judgments, we made inquiries with the General Management and the Legal and Tax Departments.\n\nWe  familiarized  ourselves  with    the  internal  control  framework  put  in place  to  identify  and  assess  these  risks.  We  corroborated  the  list  of identified tax disputes with information provided by the Company's tax departments and key tax advisors. We corroborated the list of identified disputes with information provided by the Company's leading law firms we interviewed.\n\nFor major litigation for which a liability is made, we assessed the quality of  Management's  estimates  by  considering  the  data  and  assumptions used  and  the  calculations  made.  We  also  conducted  a  retrospective analysis by comparing the amounts paid over the last few years with the amounts previously provisioned.\n\nWe have, if necessary by integrating tax experts into our team, carried out the following procedures:\n\n- \u25cf we  have  reviewed  procedural  matters  and/or  tax  or  technical opinions rendered by external advisors selected by Management to assess the appropriateness of a liability;\n- \u25cf based on the information provided to us, we have critically reviewed the  risk  estimates  and  verified  that  Management's  assessments  are within these acceptable ranges;\n- \u25cf where relevant, we have checked the permanence of the methods used for these evaluations.\n\nWith  regard  to  contingent  liabilities,  we  have,  where  appropriate  by integrating  tax  experts  into  our  team,  reviewed  procedural  elements and/or tax or technical opinions issued by external advisors selected by Management in order to assess the merits of a lack of funds.\n\n## Recognition of sales - estimation of items deducted from sales\n\nSee notes 1.1 - Accounting principles - Sales and 2 - Sales to the financial statements\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nThe  Company's  merchandise  sales  is  presented  net  of  product  returns made to distribution and discounts and rebates granted.\n\nThese  various  deductions  from  sales  are  recorded  simultaneously  with the  recognition  of  sales  on  the  basis  in  particular  of  contractual conditions and statistical data from past experience.\n\nThe revenue assessment thus includes, at the end of the financial year, estimates related to the amounts deducted, which we considered to be (i) complex,  due  to  the  diversity  of  contractual  agreements  and commercial  conditions  existing  in  the  Company's  different  markets, (ii)  sensitive,  revenue  being  a  key  indicator  in  the  evaluation  of  the performance of the Group and its Management and (iii) significant  in relation to their impact in the financial statements.\n\nThe evaluation of product returns, discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to customers is therefore considered to be a key point of the audit.\n\nWe  have  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  accounting    policies applied  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  the  recognition  of  product returns,  discounts,  rebates  and  other  benefits  granted  to  customers, with respect to French accounting principles.\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the internal control system put in place in the Company, which makes it possible to evaluate and record the items deducted  from  sales,  particularly  at  closing,  and  we  have  tested,  by sampling, the main controls of this system.\n\nWe also carried out substantive tests on representative samples in order to  assess  the  reasonableness  of  the  estimate  of  product  returns  and customer benefits. These tests mainly included:\n\n- \u25cf analysing  the  valuation  methods  used,  in  particular,  by  critically examining  the  assumptions  used,  checking  the  permanence  of  the methods and analyzing the anteriority and unwinding of provisions for the previous financial year;\n- \u25cf reconciling  statistical  data  from  past  experience  and  contractual conditions with data contained in information systems dedicated to the management of commercial conditions;\n- \u25cf verifying the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the corresponding entries  (including  the  residual  commitment  at  closing),  their  recording in the accounts and their presentation in the financial statements .\n\n<!-- image -->",

On the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your Company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers) agree with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of L'Or\u00e9al by your annual general meeting of April 29, 2004 for DELOITTE & ASSOCIES and of April 21, 2022 for ERNST & YOUNG Audit.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2022,  DELOITTE  &  ASSOCIES  was  in  the  nineteenth  year  of  total  uninterrupted  engagement  and  ERNST  & YOUNG Audit in the first year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  French accounting principles and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (Code de commerce) ,  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide  a  basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses  the  appropriateness  of  Management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  inadequate,  to  modify  the  opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee  the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense , February 17, 2023 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nDELOITTE & ASSOCIES\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit C\u00e9line Eydieu-Boutt\u00e9\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information relating to the Company\n\n## 7.1.1. General information about the Company\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  French  limited  company  (soci\u00e9t\u00e9  anonyme) governed by French law. It is registered in the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 632 012 100.\n\nThe Company's term shall be ninety-nine years, which began to run on 1 January 1963 and which shall therefore expire on 31 December 2061, except in the event of early dissolution or of extension (Article 5 of the Articles of Association). Each fiscal year  shall  have  a  duration  of  twelve  months,  beginning  on 1  January  and  ending  on  31  December  of  each  year (Article 14 of the Articles of Association).\n\nLEI (Legal Entity Identifier) Code: 529900JI1GG6F7RKVI53.\n\n## 7.1.2. Corporate purpose (excerpts from Article 2 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe Company's corporate purpose, both in France and/or at any other location anywhere throughout the entire world, includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the  manufacturing  and  the  sale  of  cosmetic  products  in general;  of  all  devices  intended  for  the  same  uses  as  the products  listed  above;  of  all  household  maintenance products;  of  all  products  and  articles  relating  to  feminine and/or child hygiene and to the embellishment of human beings; the demonstration and  advertising of such products; the manufacturing of packaging articles;\n- \u00b7 the  filing  and  the  acquisition  of  all  patents,  licences, processes and manufacturing trademarks, their exploitation, assignment and/or contribution;\n- \u00b7 all diversification transactions and all commercial, industrial, financial, movable property and/or real property transactions,  made  in  the  Company's  interest,  under  any form whatsoever;\n- \u00b7 the direct or indirect involvement in all transactions such as those listed above, in particular by means of the creation of companies,  the  contribution  to  pre-existing  companies, merger or alliance with such companies.\n\n## 7.1.3. General Management (Article 11 of the Articles of Association)\n\n- 1. 'In accordance  with  legal  provisions,  the  General Management  of  the  Company  is  assumed,  under  its responsibility,  either  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors,  or  by  another  natural  person appointed by the Board of Directors and bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe choice between these two modes of exercising General Management is made by the Board of Directors each time a Chairman of the Board of Directors or a Chief Executive Officer is appointed or has his tenure renewed. The Board of Directors  must  inform  shareholders  and  third  parties  of  this choice in accordance with the statutory provisions.\n\nThe choice of the Board of Directors concerning the mode of exercise of the General Management is made on the basis of a majority vote of the directors present or represented.\n\nChanging  the mode  of  exercise of the General Management  does  not  involve  a  modification  of  the Articles of Association.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must leave office no later than the end of the Ordinary General Meeting that follows their 65 th birthday.\n\n- 2. Depending on the choice made by the Board of Directors in  accordance with the provisions of section 1 above, the General  Management  is  carried  out  either  by  the Chairman, or by a natural person, appointed by the Board of Directors and bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n- 3. The Chief Executive Officer is granted the most extensive powers  to  act  in  any  circumstance  on  behalf  of  the Company. He exercises these powers within the limitations of the object of the Company, and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to Shareholders' Meetings.\n- The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties. The Company is bound even by actions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  which  are  outside the  object  of  the  Company,  unless  the  Company  can prove that the third party was aware that the action was outside the object of the Company, or that the third party could not be unaware of this in view of the circumstances, it  being  stated  however  that  the  mere  publication  of  the Articles of association does not constitute such proof.\n- 4. On  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  whether  this office is assumed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or by another person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more natural persons in charge of assisting the Chief Executive Officer, with the title of Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors  determines  the  extent  and  duration  of  the powers granted to the Deputy Chief Executive Officers'.",

Annual General Meeting\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  governed  by  all  the  legal provisions  and  regulations  laid  down  in  this  connection.  It  is specified that, in accordance  with  Article  12  of  the Company's Articles of Association, if the Board of Directors so decides when the General Meeting is called, any shareholder may take part in the meeting by videoconference or by any other  telecommunication  or  remote  transmission  means including the Internet, under the conditions stipulated by the applicable regulations at the time it is used. If this decision is taken, it is communicated in the meeting notice published in the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires (B.A.L.O).\n\nSince  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  29  April  2004,  double voting rights have been eliminated. Applying the provisions of French law No. 2014-384 of 29 March 2014, the Annual General Meeting  of  22  April  2015  confirmed  that  each  share  entitles the holder to only one vote at General Meetings.\n\n## 7.1.5. Statutory distribution of profits (Article 15 of the Articles of Association)\n\nA. From the distributable profits, the following amounts shall be withheld, in the following order:\n\n- 1. The amount required to pay the 'primary dividend' to the shareholders  equal  to  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  amounts paid up on the unredeemed securities in accordance with calls  for  funds,  provided  however  that  (where  the  profits for  a  given  year  do  not  allow  such  dividend  to  be  paid) the  shareholders  shall  not  be  entitled  to  claim  such dividend from out of the profits of subsequent years.\n- 2. From  the  available  remainder,  the  Ordinary  General Meeting, upon a proposal by the Board of Directors, shall have the authority to resolve to withhold the amounts that it deems appropriate (and even the entire amount of such available  remainder),  either  to  be  carried  forward  to  the next fiscal year, or to be paid into a 'prudential fund' or into one or more ordinary, extraordinary or special reserve funds.  Such  reserve  fund(s),  which  shall  not  bear  any interest, may  be  distributed  to  the  shareholders,  or allocated  to  complete  the  5%  primary  dividend  for  the shareholders, in the event of insufficient results during one or more fiscal years, or to acquire and to cancel shares in the Company, or to redeem in whole or in part such shares.\n- 3. The remaining balance (if any) shall be divided up among all the shareholders, without any discrimination, and each share shall entitle its holder to receive the same income.\n\nHowever, any shareholder who can prove at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  payment  of  the dividend paid for such financial year, will be entitled to a preferential dividend on the shares that are thus registered, equal  to  10%  of  the  dividend  (initial  dividend  and additional dividend) paid on the other shares, including in the event of payment of the dividend in new shares, the preferential dividend thus paid being rounded down to the nearest lower cent, if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, any shareholder who can prove, at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  completion  of  an increase  in  capital  carried  out  through  capitalisation  of reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums  by  the  distribution  of\n\nbonus shares, shall be entitled to an increase in the number of bonus shares to be distributed to him, equal to 10%, this number being rounded down to the nearest lower unit in the event of fractional share rights.\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be identical, for the  purposes  of  calculating  the  rights  to  the  preferential dividend and to the increased share allocations, to the old shares from which they result.\n\nThe number of shares eligible for these preferential dividends may  not  exceed  0.5%  of  the  share  capital  at  the  closing date of the past financial year, for the same shareholder.\n\n- B. The losses (if any) shall be charged to the retained earnings from preceding  fiscal  years  or  to  the  reserve  funds,  and  the  balance shall be booked into a special 'carry forward' account'.\n\n## 7.1.6. Statutory share ownership thresholds (extracts from Article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\n'Any person, acting alone or in concert, who comes to hold, directly  or  indirectly,  a  number  of  shares  or  voting  rights representing  a  fraction  of  the  share  capital  or  voting  rights, taking  into  account  equivalent  securities  under  the  meaning of  Article  L.  233-9  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  equal  to 1% or a multiple of this percentage, and lower than 5%, must inform  the  Company  of  the  total  number  of  shares,  voting rights  and securities giving access to the share capital that it holds, as well as of equivalent securities under the meaning of Article  L.  233-9  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  within  a period  of  five  trading  days,  from  the  date  of  the  threshold crossing,  pursuant  to  the  notification  and  content  conditions stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to declarations  of  legal  threshold  crossings,  and,  notably  by declaring the information that must be provided when a legal threshold is  crossed  to  the  French  Financial  Markets  Authority (AMF), in accordance with its General Regulations. Such notice must  also  be  given  to  the  Company  when  a  shareholder's ownership  falls  below  one  of  the  thresholds  set  forth  above.' This provision of the Articles of Association supplements the legal requirements  covering  disclosures  concerning  the  crossing, upwards or downwards, of thresholds relating to one-twentieth, one-tenth, three-twentieths, one-fifth, one-quarter, three-tenths, one-third, one-half, two-thirds, eighteen-twentieths or nineteen-twentieths of share capital or of voting rights.\n\n'If not disclosed in accordance with the conditions stipulated by law or by the Articles of Association, the shares of the offending shareholder  exceeding  the  fraction  which  should  have  been disclosed are deprived of voting rights, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the French Commercial Code, if during a General  Meeting  the  failure  to  disclose  is  noted  and  if  one  or more  shareholders  together  holding  at  least  5%  of  the  share capital so request during said meeting'.\n\n## 7.1.7. Consultation of documents relating to the Company\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association are available in full at www.loreal-finance.com,  under  the  heading ' Regulated information'.\n\nThe  Articles  of  Association,  financial  statements,  reports  and information  for  shareholders  can  be  consulted,  in  the conditions provided for by law, at 41, rue Martre, 92117 Clichy Cedex,  France,  preferably  by  appointment.

Presentation of the stock option Plans for the purchase or subscription of shares and Plans for Conditional Grants of Shares to employees (ACAs)\n\n## Policy\n\nFor several years L'Or\u00e9al has set up long-term incentive plans in  favour  of  its  employees  and  corporate  officers  in  an international  context,  in  the  form  of  grants  of  performance shares.\n\nThese grants serve a dual purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 motivate  and  associate  those  who  make  significant contributions  to  future  increases  in  the  Group's  financial and extra-financial results; and\n- \u00b7 strengthen  involvement  and  the  sense  of  belonging  of  its beneficiaries  by  fostering  long-term  loyalty  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nSince  the  2022  ACAs  Plan,  performance  conditions  have included  the  non-financial  criteria  described  below.  These criteria  need  to  fit  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  dual  goal:  economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all.\n\n## History\n\nUntil  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  exclusively  granted stock  options  to  the  senior  managers  and  corporate  officers whom  L'Or\u00e9al  wished  to  reward  for  their  performance  and their  important  role,  wherever  they  might  be  geographically located.\n\nIn  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  enlarged  its  policy  by introducing an ACAs mechanism.\n\nThe objective was:\n\n- \u00b7 to provide a long-term incentive offering greater motivation to  all  those  who  received  stock  options  only  occasionally or in limited numbers; and\n- \u00b7 to reach  out  to  a  broader  population  of  potential beneficiaries,  particularly  internationally,  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nIn  2011,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  make  ACAs the  primary  instrument  for  its  long-term  incentive  policy  by extending the grant of shares to the main senior managers of the  Group  who  until  then  had  only  received  stock  options. In  2012,  at  the  suggestion  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  went  one step further in this policy and decided to replace the grant of stock  options  with  conditional  grants  of  shares  for  all beneficiaries as of the 2013 Plan.\n\n## Grant process\n\nThe  plans  are  proposed  by  General  Management  to  the Board of Directors which decides, after receiving the opinion of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee, the  principle  of  these  plans  and  the  applicable  conditions and rules.\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendation, these  grants  are  made  over  the  same  period  each  year: between 2009 and 2019 they were put in place following the approval  of  the  financial  accounts  for  the  previous  financial year  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  and  since  2020  they have been put in place at the end of the year, provided that the  first  year  the  performance  conditions  are  assessed  is  the financial year following the year of grant.\n\nThe decision with regard to each individual grant is, in every case,  contingent  upon  the  quality  of  the  performance rendered  at  the  time  of  implementation  of  the  plan  with particular  attention  being  paid  to  the  main  talents  for  the future. According to the eligibility criteria linked to the position held  by  the  beneficiary  and  the  size  of  the  entity  or  the country  in  which  the  beneficiary  works,  to  ensure  worldwide fairness,  these  grants  are  made  every  year,  on  a  recurring basis every two to three years, or more regularly.\n\nThe General Management and the Board of Directors reiterate the importance that is given to bringing together the interests of the beneficiaries of conditional grants of shares and those of the shareholders themselves.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  (employees  and  directors  and  corporate officers)  share  with  the  shareholders  the  same  confidence  in the strong steady growth of the Company with a medium and long-term  vision.  Stock  options  were  granted  for  a  period  of 10 years including a five-year vesting period, and conditional grants of shares for a period of four years, followed, for France and  up  until  the  2015  Plan,  by  a  two-year  holding  period during which these shares could not be transferred.\n\nThe  attention  of  the  beneficiaries  of  conditional  grants  of shares is drawn to the regulations in force concerning persons holding  'inside  information'.  The  beneficiaries  of  conditional grants  of  shares  undertake  to  read  L'Or\u00e9al's  Stock  Market Code of Ethics, included when settling the conditional grants of shares plans that they benefit from, and to comply with the provisions thereof.\n\n## Number of beneficiaries\n\n53%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  13  October  2022  Plan  are women.  Nearly  4,200  employees,  representing  10.5%  of  the managers  around  the  world,  nearly  58%  of  whom  are  in international  subsidiaries,  benefit  or  have  benefited  from  at least one conditional grant of shares plan since 2018 and were still employees of the Company on 31 December 2022.",

Absence of stock option plans for the subscription and purchase of shares of the Company\n\nAt 31 December 2022, there was no stock option plan in place for the purchase of Company shares (1) , the last plan having expired in 2021.\n\n## 7.4.3. Plan for the Conditional Grants of Shares (ACAs)\n\n## 7.4.3.1. Authorisation of the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 21 April 2022\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022 gave the Board of Directors the authorisation to carry out free grants of existing shares and/or shares to be issued to employees, directors and corporate officers of the Company and of its French or foreign subsidiaries under the conditions of Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting set the period of validity of the authorisation, which may be used on one or more occasions, at 26 months.\n\nThe  total  number  of  free  shares  thus  granted  may  not represent more than 0.6% of the share capital recorded on the date of the Board of Directors' decision.\n\nThe  number  of  free  shares  granted  to  the  Company's corporate  officers  may  not  represent  more  than  10%  of  the total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  a  financial  year pursuant to this resolution.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  determine  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries  of  the  free  shares  and  the  number  granted  to each of them. It will also determine the conditions to be met in order for the shares to fully vest, in particular the financial and non-financial performance conditions.\n\n## Financial and non-financial performance conditions\n\nThe financial performance criteria are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  like-for-like  cosmetics  sales  as compared  to  those  of  a  panel  of  its  biggest  direct competitors (2) ; and\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n\nThe non-financial performance criteria are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 fulfilment of environmental and social responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the  Future  programme  (%  of  sites  that  are  'carbon neutral' (3) ; %  of  formula  ingredients  that  are  biobased, traceable and come from sustainable sources; % of plastic packaging  that  comes  from  either  recycled  or  biobased sources;  number  of  people  benefitting  from  the  Group's brands' social commitment programmes); and\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  strategic  positions  including  the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors indeed considers that these two types of criteria, assessed over a long period of 3 financial years and applied to several plans, are complementary, in line with the Group's  objectives  and  its  specificities  and  likely  to  promote balanced,  continuing  growth  over  the  long  term.  They  are exacting  but  remain  a  source  of  motivation  for  the beneficiaries. The grant of such shares to their beneficiaries, for all  or  part  of  the  shares  granted,  will  become  final  provided that  the  other  conditions  set  at  the  time  of  grant  are  met, at the end of a minimum vesting period of 4 years.",

Below this level,  the  grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in sales of the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all the  free  shares  granted  to  be  fully  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  level  of growth defined by the Board of Directors, but not made public for  confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  achieved  or  exceeded.

The free  grant  of  shares  may  be  carried  out  for  all  Group  staff without performance conditions, or for shares allocated on the basis  of  cash  subscriptions  carried  out  as  part  of  an  increase in share capital reserved for Group employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be able to provide for vesting and holding  periods  which  are  longer  than  the  minimum  periods set above.\n\nThe  mechanism  for  the  Conditional  Grant  of  Shares  to employees complies with the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nAny  allocations  of  shares  to  the  directors  and  corporate officers will be decided by the Board of Directors on the basis of  the  proposals  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  after  assessment  of  their  performance.

Conditional Grants of Shares granted within the framework of the authorisation of 21 April 2022 (ACAs Plan of 13 October 2022)\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  proposals  made  by  the  General Management  and  examined  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided, at  its  meeting  on  13  October  2022,  to  make  a  Conditional Grant of Shares within the scope of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2022.\n\nThe  share  capital  at  13  October  2022  was  composed  of 536,728,876  shares,  and  3,220,373  shares  could  therefore  be issued.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  used  this  authorisation  at  its  meeting of 13 October 2022 by granting 700,000 shares to 2,647 beneficiaries. This is a free grant of shares to be issued.\n\nVesting of the shares is subject to a dual condition:\n\n- \u00b7 presence: the shares granted will only vest after a period of 4  years  at  the  end  of  which  the  beneficiary  must  still  be an employee of the Group (except in the cases provided by the law or the Plan rules); and\n- \u00b7 performance, evaluated as follows:\n\nFinancial criteria represent 80% of the performance conditions, split evenly between:\n\n- \u00b7 the  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  like-for-like  cosmetics  sales  as compared  to  those  of  a  panel  of  its  biggest  direct competitors (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 the growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit.\n\nNon-financial criteria represent 20% of performance conditions and are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments  made  by  the  Group  as  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future  programme  (accounts  for  15%  of  the performance conditions), i.e. the % of sites that are 'carbon neutral' (2) ;  the % of formula ingredients that are bio-based, traceable and come from sustainable sources; and the % of  plastic  packaging  that  comes  from  either  recycled  or biobased  sources;  number  of  people  benefitting  from  the Group's brands' social commitment programmes; and\n- \u00b7 the gender balance within strategic positions including the Executive Committee (accounts for 5% of the performance conditions).\n\nThe  calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  arithmetic average of the performances for 2023, 2024 and 2025.",

Information and shareholder dialogue policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  its  financial information  and  takes  steps  to  ensure  it  maintains  a  regular dialogue with its shareholders and  with French and international  investors.  Beyond  its  legal  obligations,  a  whole range  of  information  and  communication  tools  are  made available to all stakeholders to give them  a  better understanding of L'Or\u00e9al's business model and the potential of the beauty market. These comprise documentation, including digital  media  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance  website,  shareholder events  and  meetings  either  organised  physically  or  virtually, and investor conferences and roadshows.\n\n## 7.6.1. Additional communication tools\n\nKeen on transparency and accessibility of information, in 2022, another  year  marked  by  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  L'Or\u00e9al's Financial  Communication  Department  shared  a  wealth  of complete  financial  and  non-financial  information  with  the entire  financial  community.  It  relies  on  communication  tools with a high emphasis on digital:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al makes available two comprehensive and complementary publications each year, the Annual Report and  the  Universal Registration Document,  and  one interim  publication,  the  Half-Year  Financial  Report.  These documents  can  be  consulted  and  downloaded  at www.loreal-finance.com. In 2022, the Universal Registration Document  was  published  in  an  interactive  format  to improve user-friendliness and access to content.\n- \u00b7 The www.loreal-finance.com website contains a complete set of all financial and non-financial information. Its content and  ergonomics  evolve  regularly  to  provide  quicker  and easier access to information.\n- \u00b7 The  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance  mobile  app,  available  on  the  App Store  and  Google  Play,  makes  it  possible  to  keep  L'Or\u00e9al Finance  news  close  to  hand.  Downloaded  more  than 64,000  times  since  it  was  created,  it  is  highly  appreciated by professionals and individual shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The  Letter  to  Shareholders  and  e-newsletters  make  it possible  to  keep  shareholders  and  subscribers  regularly informed of all the Group's major events.\n- \u00b7 The  shareholder  brochure  'Take  part  in  the  L'Or\u00e9al adventure' describes the Company's business model and explains  the  advantages  of  registered  shares  to  answer questions that shareholders may have about this shareholding method.\n- \u00b7 Several 'best-of' films featuring the main events of the year have  been  made  and  posted  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance website, so our shareholders can relive these moments.\n- \u00b7 Testifying  to  the  loyalty  of  the  shareholders  who  support the  Group's  development  over  the  long  term,  more  and more  shareholders  are  showing  an  interest  in  becoming registered shareholders. Thanks to preferential dividends and the  advantages  related  to  this  method  of  shareholding, becoming a registered shareholder enables shareholders to be  known  to  the  Group,  to  have  systematic  and  regular access  to  information,  and  to  be  closely  involved  in  the Group's development.\n\nIn 2022,  the  Group  and  the  Financial  Communications Department were recognised for their achievements:\n\n- \u00b7 On 28 June, we received an award from the Palmes d'or des  jeunes  actionnaires  (Young  Shareholders  Awards), created  by  EDHEC  Business  School  and  the  Federation  of Individual  Investors  and  Investment  Clubs  (F2iC),  for  our approach  to  informing  and  communicating  with  our shareholders.\n- \u00b7 On 5 July,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  received  the  Award for  ESG  Purpose  and  Commitments  at  the  2022  General Meeting and Gender Balance Awards ceremony, organised by the Institut du Capitalisme Responsable.\n- \u00b7 On 20 September, the Group Chairman received the 2022 award from the Appeal of Conscience Foundation for his long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility.\n- \u00b7 On 10 November, and for the second consecutive year, at the  21 st Investor  Awards  ceremony,  winning  the  Best Website award for L'Or\u00e9al-finance.com via Boursorama.\n- \u00b7 On  1  December,  L'Or\u00e9al  won  the  top  prize  -  the  Grand Troph\u00e9e  d'Or  -  for  the  CAC40  company  with  the  best shareholder relations, awarded by Le Revenu magazine.\n- \u00b7 On  7  December,  at  the  Grand  Prix  Strat\u00e9gies  du  Luxe awards,  L'Or\u00e9al's  2021  Annual  Report  won  two  awards, receiving  the  Gold  award  for  best  website  (in  the  digital/ mobile  category)  and  a  Bronze  award  for  best  corporate communication.\n\n## 7.6.2. A large number of shareholder events for regular and detailed dialogue\n\nIn  2022,  events  were  organised,  some  in  digital  format,  to maintain relationships and promote dialogue. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 The Financial Communications  Department  and  the Investor Relations Department  organised  a  financial information meeting and telephone conferences intended for analysts and institutional investors. Journalists specialising in  the  cosmetics  sector  were  invited.  The  presentations  of the  Group's  financial  results  and  the  business  activities  of the  Operational  Divisions  were  broadcast  live  online on  the  financial  website  www.loreal-finance.com.  All  the information presented was made available on this site, on the day of its publication, when the annual and half-yearly results were published, as well as at investor conferences.\n- \u00b7 The  Annual  General  Meeting  was  broadcast  live  and  on demand,  in  French  and  English,  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance website.  For  several  years,  shareholders  have  had  the option  to  vote  remotely  via  the  Votaccess  platform.  This year,  in  order  to  respect  shareholder  democracy  and encourage dialogue with shareholders, and in addition to the  legal  process  for  written  questions,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a dedicated email address to receive, in the days preceding the  Annual  General  Meeting (1) ,  all  their  questions  to  be made directly to Management. Shareholders also had the opportunity  to  ask  questions  via  an  electronic  platform, both  before  and  during  the  Annual  General  Meeting. This broadcast was viewed by around 2,000 shareholders.",

Independence of Directors\n\nEvery year the Nominations and Governance Committee proposes  to  the  Board  of  Directors  that  the  situation  of each of the Directors with regard to their independence be reviewed on a case-by-case basis according to the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe review of the independence of these Directors was carried  out  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  basis, in  particular,  of  a  study  of  the  relationships  existing between the Company and the companies in which the Directors hold offices.\n\nIf the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and renewals that are proposed by the Board of Directors, the number of Independent Directors will be 7 out of 14, i.e .  an  independence  rate  of  50%  (the  two  Directors representing the employees are not taken into account pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code).\n\n## 3.2. Balanced gender representation in the Board of Directors\n\nIf the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and renewals submitted to it, the number of women in the Board of Directors would be 7 out of the 14 Directors appointed by the Annual General Meeting, i.e. a  percentage  representation  of  women  of  50% (the  two  Directors  representing  the  employees  are  not taken into  account pursuant to the French Commercial Code).\n\n## 3.3. Length of office and minimum number of shares held\n\nThe  term  of  office  of  the  Directors  appointed  by  the Company's Annual General Meeting is four years or less to  allow  a  scheduled  renewal  of  the  terms  of  office of  Directors.

This ceilling  corresponds  to  a  maximum  increase  of  40% compared to the share capital as at 31 December 2022. This  ceiling  will  also  be  affected  by  any  increases  that may be carried out under the nineteenth resolution voted on  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022, or  the  fifteenth,  sixteenth,  seventeenth  and  eighteenth resolutions  submitted to the vote of this Meeting, it being specified  that  this  total  nominal  amount  does  not  take into  account  any  adjustments  that  may  be  made  in accordance  with  the  applicable  legal  and  regulatory provisions and, where  applicable, with contractual obligations  providing  for  other  adjustments,  in  order  to safeguard the rights of holders of free shares in particular;\n\nThere is no provision for any overallocation option.\n\nThis  delegation will  be  valid  for  twenty-six  months  from  the date of this Annual General Meeting, it being specified that in the event of a public offer being filed by a third party with regard  to  the  shares  of  the  Company,  the  Board  of Directors will not be able to use this authorisation during the public  offer  period  without  the  prior  authorisation  of  the Annual General Meeting.

If  subscriptions  as  of  right and, if applicable, in excess of those as of right, have not absorbed  the  entirety  of  a  share  issue,  the  Board  of Directors  may  offer  all  or  some  of  the  unsubscribed securities  to  the  public  or  limit  the  share  capital  increase to  the  amount  of  subscriptions,  provided  that  the  latter achieves at least three-quarters of the increase decided;\n- 4. decides that share capital increases may be carried out at any moment, in accordance with the regulations in force at the time.

Glossary\n\nAFEP-MEDEF  Code : a code  of  corporate  governance comprising  a  set  of  recommendations  drawn  up  by  the Association  Fran\u00e7aise  des  Entreprises  Priv\u00e9es (AFEP)  and  the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF), in the light of consultation  with  various  market  players,  on  corporate governance issues. L'Or\u00e9al refers to this Code.\n\nAutorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers (AMF) :  the  French  financial markets  authority,  an  independent,  public,  stock-market authority,  which  is  responsible  for  the  protection  of  savings invested  in  financial  products,  investor  information  and  the proper functioning of the markets.\n\nBeauty  Tech: new  technologies  for  the  cosmetics  industry intended  to  enhance  science  via  large-scale  cutting-edge technologies  and  to  offer  unparalleled  beauty  experiences (see section 1.1.2.3).\n\nBoard  of  Directors: the  collegiate  body  that  defines  the Company's business strategy and monitors its implementation, in accordance  with  its  corporate  interest,  taking  into consideration the social and  environmental  challenges associated with its business activity.\n\n' Carbon neutral ' : A site can claim 'carbon neutral' status if it meets the following requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Direct  CO2  (Scope  1)  =  0,  with  the  exception  of  the  gas used  for  catering,  the  fuel  oil  used  for  sprinkler  tests,  fossil energy  consumptions  during  maintenance  of  on-site renewable facilities, cooling gas leaks if they are lower than 130 tonnes CO2eq./year; and\n- \u00b7 Indirect CO2 Market Based (Scope 2) = 0.\n\nThe renewable energy sources must be located on site or less than  500  kilometres  from  the  site,  and  be  connected  to  the same  distribution  network.  The  'carbon  neutral'  status  thus defined is achieved without offsetting. See section 4.3.1.1.3. B/.\n\nCDP (formerly the 'Carbon Disclosure Project') : an independent, recognised,  international  not-for-profit  organisation,  offering  a system for assessing a company's strategy, initiatives and results in the fight against  climate  change,  sustainable  water management and forest protection.\n\nCode of Ethics :  Available in 45 languages, and in French and English  Braille,  it  is  distributed  to  all  employees  worldwide. It  enables  employees  to  understand  how  Ethical  Principles (Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and  Transparency)  need  to  be reflected  in  their  behaviour  and  actions  by  providing  simple rules  and  a  description  of  concrete  situations  they  may encounter.  The  Code  of  Ethics  applies  to  all  employees, directors and  corporate  officers  and  members  of  the Executive and Management Committees of the Group and its subsidiaries  worldwide.  Since  2010,  18  supplements  to  the Code  of  Ethics  have  covered  certain  aspects  of  it  in  more detail (see section 4.3.3.).\n\nCompany: the Company is the parent company, L'Or\u00e9al S.A. (see paragraph 5.1.).\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements :  the consolidated financial statements  include  the  financial  statements  of  all  the companies within the L'Or\u00e9al Group.\n\nCreate  the  beauty  that  moves  the  world : L'Or\u00e9al's  sense  of purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre ) . It is defined in concrete actions made to  consumers,  employees,  clients,  suppliers,  shareholders, service  providers  and  communities.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to fighting  climate  change,  by  respecting  biodiversity  and preserving  natural  resources,  and  to  championing  the  cause of  women. A full explanation of L'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose is given in section 1.1.1.\n\nCSR: corporate social, societal and environmental responsibility (see chapter 4 in particular).\n\nEFRAG : European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, responsible  for  advising  the  European  Commission  and mandated  by  the  latter  to  develop  sustainability  standards under the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al BOOST :  the latest programme in the L'Or\u00e9al for Youth initiative,  launched  by  the  Group  in  July  2021,  aimed  at  the under-30s.  It  aims  to  offer  20,000  students  each  year  access to  a  selection  of  on-demand,  digital  courses  from  Coursera, a  leading  provider  of  online  learning  for  students  and businesses.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth :  a  comprehensive,  long-term  programme launched in 2021, which aims to support the employment of young people and improve their employment prospects. The Group  is  committed  to  increasing  the  number  of  job opportunities  aimed  at  those  under  the  age  of  30,  offering training  packages  and  rolling  out  coaching  and  mentoring initiatives.  As  part  of  this  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  grants scholarships  to  support  students  from  disadvantaged  areas (see section 4.3.2.).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future :  the  second  generation  of  L'Or\u00e9al's commitments  to  sustainable  development.  The  programme was  launched  in  June  2020  with  a  new  set  of  particularly ambitious  targets  for  2030,  in  order  to  cover  all  the  impacts associated  with  the  Group's  value  chain.  The  programme, which  aims  to  ensure  that  the  Group's  business  activities remain within the planetary boundaries defined by environmental  science,  thus  marks  a  new  ambition  for  the sustainable  development  of  L'Or\u00e9al  with  the  intention  of capitalising  on  previous  achievements [see section 1.3.2 and chapter 4].\n\nMarket  capitalisation :  the  market  value  of  a  company  at  a given moment. It is calculated by multiplying the market price by  the  number  of  shares  comprising  the  share  capital.

It  guarantees consumers compliance with strict standards  of  quality,  safety,  security  and  societal  and environmental responsibility all over the world.\n\nPackaging :  all  the  materials  which,  without  being  part  of  the product  itself,  are  sold  with  the  product  for  the  purposes of enabling or facilitating its protection, transportation, storage, presentation, packing, identification and use by consumers.\n\nParent  company  financial  statements : The  parent  company financial statements correspond to the annual financial statements of the Company, L'Or\u00e9al S.A. (the parent company).",
