Funds not tied up in the hedging portfolio as a result of the use of derivative financial instruments are available for investment in the investment portfolio on market terms. In practice, this means that the investment portfolio can operate with more funds than the bonus potential. The market value at the end of 2022 was DKK 310.5bn. The market value of the investment portfolio also includes financial derivatives of which the market value will typically be low, zero or negative.\n\n- 2 Return per average risk krone is calculated as the annualised accumulated return for the period compared to the average risk for the same period.

        "page_content": "## Management's review 2022\n\n## 2022 was a difficult year, also for ATP\n\nAn energy crisis, inflation, share price decreases, very high interest rate hikes and war in Europe were all seen this year and it had a negative impact on ATP's result.\n\nATP's pension product provides basic financial security to the  Danish population in the form of a lifelong guaranteed pension product. This guarantee is completely firm even after a 2022 with major declines in the financial markets. This is a reflection of the hedging portfolio, where ATP invests the majority of its assets, having moved at the same pace as ATP's liabilities - as it should. Conversely, the results in the investment portfolio, where ATP invests its reserves, has shown a great loss which reflects the negative trend in the markets. Overall, ATP's business model has shown itself to be robust. ATP's bonus capacity, i.e. its ability to pay bonuses to its members, amounts to approximately 18 per cent of the pension liabilities at the end of 2022, whereas this figure was 20 per cent at the end of 2021.\n\nAs all of Denmark's pension fund with 5.5 million members that get a guaranteed and lifelong pension from us, we are providers of basic financial security. We are also striving to achieve the best returns over time in our investment portfolio so that we can increase the pensions. We were unable to deliver on those returns in 2022. In fact, the year was characterised by losses for nearly all types of assets. The result for the year was DKK (57)bn, of which the investment return amounted to DKK (64)bn.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, there will be both good years and bad news. It turns out that 2022 was a very bad year for investing - but this should be viewed in the context of a number of prior years with large positive returns. As an investor, we are not satisfied with the return generated in 2022. The losses have generally been seen by financial\n\nactors such as ourselves throughout the world after a very unusual year. All investors, both large and small, have had to really take a hard look at their strategy in order to assess whether it is durable in a time where there is so much uncertainty and no signs of the economy improving in the near future. Our business model is designed to do that - and it is not possible to have an investment strategy that only ever generates large profits.\n\nAt ATP, we have adjusted our risk on an ongoing basis. Our business model is also designed to be able to withstand what happens when, not least, interest rates rise quickly. We have a general investment strategy that has over the past 10 years (including 2022) generated DKK 126bn in returns, and we will stick with this strategy even after a year like 2022. We believe that the investment strategy's integrated risk adjustment and the risk appetite of our newly adjusted business model is what will bring ATP, and thus its members, the best possible long-term returns. As a long-term investor, we have charted our course - and this also involves daring to stick to that course during periods where it is hard to generate returns and thereby grow our members' pensions.\n\n## The guarantees are iron clad\n\nATP's most important task is to pay the pensions that we have promised to our members. And we are keeping that promise. Regardless of the major decreases in share prices and the major interest rate hikes of 2022, the hedging strategy for our business model ensures that we are always able to pay what we have guaranteed. Our members know what they will be paid, and that guarantee is an important characteristic of the ATP pension.\n\nThe guaranteed pensions are firm despite the financial turbulence of 2022. So is our green ambition to have DKK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100bn allocated to green investments in 2025. With rising interest rates and falling valuations, it has not become easier to meet our ambitions, but we are making progress. During the year, ATP has allocated a total of DKK 27bn to green investments and our total portfolio of green invest -ments was at DKK 66bn at the end of the year.\n\n## The success of Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration\n\nBesides the role of being a pension fund for virtually all of Denmark, ATP has another significant task as the payer of most of Danish welfare benefits. Via the self-governing institution Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration (which is part of the ATP Group), there was for example paid out state pensions\n\namounting to DKK 145bn, maternity/paternity leave benefits of DKK 12bn and rent subsidies of DKK 16bn just in 2022. Almost half of the residents of Denmark across all age groups are currently benefitting from the benefits paid out from Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration which, due to efficient operations, frees up money in the Danish state and municipalities that can be spent on other welfare programmes.\n\n2022 included the 10-year anniversary of Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration as a new core authority in the Danish welfare state. It was created to streamline the administration, ensure uniform case processing and support the legal rights of Danish citizens. The ambition was originally that Udbetaling Danmark -",

        "page_content": "Public Benefits Administration would ensure savings of DKK 300 million after three years (compared to what it cost when the tasks were handled by municipalities). In addition, Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Adminis -tration was to generate savings of at least 25 per cent on IT expenses through a competitive IT system environment - and the financial gains were to be allocated to the municipalities.\n\nThe goal of reducing the annual operating expenses by DKK 300 million was reached on schedule in 2015, and subsequently, the ongoing streamlining of operations via more automation and digitalisation has resulted in contin -ually falling operating expenses.  In addition, the ambition to expose IT systems to a competitive environment was achieved with annual savings in IT expenses of approxi -mately DKK 260 million, or 30 per cent. The total savings amounted to DKK 700 million.\n\nWith a political desire to take advantage of Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration's potential in the welfare state, more municipal and state payment and service tasks were allocated over time. The political focus on the opportunity to retire from the labour market early has in the past few years grown ATP's portfolio of tasks, particularly in terms of the Senior Pension and Early Retirement Pension.\n\n## Digitalisation is to provide more welfare\n\nSo what are the primary ingredients of the welfare admin -istration that ATP practices? The answer is data and digitalisation. ATP has an enormous amount of data at its disposal, and that data is used constructively to develop digital systems that streamline and improve the welfare system. For example, working with customer advisory services in a systematic manner has meant that ATP saves thousands of hours that would otherwise be spent on this. The time that is freed up can then instead be used on solving more tasks and having more contact with the citizens of Denmark. This has also allowed ATP to shorten the case processing times significantly for those applying for welfare benefits.\n\nHowever, it is also important that digitalisation takes place in ways that accommodate everyone. A large group of Danish citizens do not have experience with technology and digital equipment - and for them, digitali -sation becomes a difficult hindrance. ATP is also focusing on this group of people, and we view it is an additional challenge that we need to address when designing our customer service.\n\nOverall, however, there are many gains from digital -isation, and in 2022 ATP increased its focus on this area by moving the strategic digitalisation work to the group management team. A new Chief Information and Technology Officer will now focus on strengthening the digital development across the entire business and to equip ATP - both as a pension provider and administrator of welfare services - to face an even more digital future. Together with a new group management team, I look forward to getting to work in 2023.\n\nMartin Pr\u00e6stegaard CEO, ATP\n\n## Strategic focus areas\n\nWith Strategy 2023 'A sustainable ATP', the Supervisory Board has defined six strategic focus areas aimed at ensuring that ATP creates value in terms of welfare, sustainability and digitalisation:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong customer and stakeholder focus\n\nAs a monopoly we must never forget our customers, and the role that ATP plays\n\nin society makes it crucial that we enjoy the support and trust of our stakeholders - members, citizens, politicians and clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsibility\n\nThrough all parts of the group, ATP makes its mark on the society that we are\n\na part of.

In Denmark, 5.5 million people are ATP members. For approximately 40 per cent of all current pensioners in Denmark, ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is their only pension payment beyond the state pension. For these members, the ATP benefit and its in-built guarantee is particularly important. In 2022, ATP paid out DKK 18b to its members or their dependants and the average annual payment for a 67-year-old was DKK 19,000.\n\nATP's most important task is to  - regardless of market developments - be able to pay the pensions that we have promised our members. And we are keeping that promise, ATP makes every effort to provide stable pensions and returns that over time can contribute to ensuring the real value of the lifelong pensions and create basic financial security together with the state pension. At the start of 2022, ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) was increased by 4 per cent for all members after a number of years with record-high investment results. As an ATP member, you are guaranteed to have the ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) paid out from the time you reach the state retirement age to when you die. This life expectancy guarantee, which enters into force already from the first contribution, is an essential part of the product, also when many people in Denmark are living longer and longer.\n\n## The importance of the guarantees grows in a year with large negative investment returns\n\nDespite the large negative investment result in 2022, there is no doubt about ATP's ability to make the future payments to its members. The investment result, which is closely correlated with significantly higher inflation and rising interest rates, does not affect this guarantee. This is because we use interest hedging to ensure that we can\n\nalways pay our members what we have promised them. The relationship between the guaranteed pensions and the interest rate hedging ensures that ATP has the funds to honour our guarantees.\n\nIn 2022, there have been steep rises in interest rates and thus the present value of the guaranteed pensions have decreased by DKK 214bn. This development can be seen in ATP's assets. For members, however, the critical factor is not whether ATP's assets are growing, decreasing or remaining stable. The critical factor is that our investment strategy ensures that we always have enough funds to pay what we have guaranteed our members, regardless of which direction interest rates move in. And that is precisely what we ensure is possible by hedging our risks so that fluctuations in interest rate do not impact our members' pensions either now or in the future.\n\nThe guarantees include an integrated value creation This value creation from the guarantees illustrates the average return on the promises ATP has issued to members over time, across age groups. In 2022, this return was 3.1 per cent. The total value creation is a weighting of the returns on the guarantees and the value creation in the bonus potential.

With payments of over DKK 300bn made directly to the Danish citizens, for many, ATP is the face they see when they think of the welfare state. Therefore, it needs to be both easy and accessible to interact with ATP, and this requires a dialogue with citizens, companies, organisations and authorities.\n\nATP solves tasks on behalf of the state, municipalities and social partners. Part of these tasks are assigned to self-governing institutions or funds with their own Supervisory Board that ATP administers in practice. This includes, for example, Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration, AES, AUB and L\u00f8nmodtagernes Feriemidler.\n\n## Clear communication to families with children\n\nIn January 2022, Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration paid out child and youth benefit to both parents for the first time due to a change to the law that the Danish Parliament adopted in 2021. And on 1 August 2022, Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration was ready to administer a comprehensive legal change that (based on an EU Directive) was to ensure equal amounts of maternity/paternity leave to both parents.\n\nThis has required a comprehensive IT development work and preparing the legal basis for case processing and customer service. We have also worked to ensure that the families with children who would be impacted were ready and understood what was going to happen. In the context of maternity/ paternity leave, employers were also in the target group. Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits\n\nAdministration has therefore involved organisations for people in various life situations and labour market organisations so that we can work together to ensure that we make the best solutions. We have also helped organisations provide the correct advice to their members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Award-winning self-service for rent subsidies\n\nThe engagement of the Danish citizens has been the foundation of the work involved with Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Admin -istration's new self-service solution that can be used to apply for rent subsidies. The solution was launched on borger.dk in 2021 and has resulted in noticeable gains for both residents of Denmark and Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration. For example, 20 per cent fewer are calling to get assistance and then number of errors in applications has been reduced by 39 per cent. The customer satisfac -tion surveys in 2022 show that 90 per cent were satisfied or very satisfied with the self-service solution which, all in all, supports a better user journey for the more than 200,000 households who apply for rent subsidies each year.\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration and the supplier, Pentia, won a silver award at the Danish Digital Awards in 2022. The jury said:\n\n- '(...) The solution succeeds in including residents of Denmark who may be digitally weak and performs well in terms of ensuring the payment of rent subsidies to those who are entitled to them and it contributes to reducing social inequality.\n\n(This) has made an extremely complex legal area simple and accessible to all. The jury hopes that the solution can inspire other public institutions to rethink their use of digital forms.'",

This role has a major impact on how we design ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) and manage our investments. ATP's role was most recently highlighted in connection with the Danish Parliament's processing of the ATP Act in May 2021. In this context, a broad majority of the Danish Parliament agreed to cement ATP's position in the Danish pension system as part of the basic security of the so-called 1st pillar together with the state pension. The change gave ATP the opportunity to optimise our business model for the benefit of our 5.5 million members.\n\nThe business model is therefore designed for the purpose of providing basic financial security via lifelong guaranteed pensions that aim to preserve their real value over time. This separates the business model from those of other pension suppliers, which are typically aimed at replacing a work income during retirement.\n\nAll of ATP's assets belong to our members, and therefore we have no equity of our own. ATP's assets can thus fundamentally be divided into funds to cover the lifelong guaranteed pensions and undistributed funds that have not yet been divided among the members.\n\nThe mandatory payment is divided into a guarantee contribution and a bonus contribution where the guarantee contribution is 80 per cent of the contribution and the bonus contribution is 20 per cent. The guarantee contribution is used to ensure that the individual members have a lifelong and guaranteed pension from the time they reach the retirement age and the bonus contribution, which is undistributed, is to contribute to ensuring the real value of the lifelong pensions over time and to cover unforeseen\n\nevents that might impact ATP such as, for example, longer life expectancies among members. The funds that are allocated to the guarantee contribution and the bonus contribution are thus invested taking into account their respective roles. The guarantee contribution is invested with a low risk profile in bonds and interest swaps so that ATP can be sure that it is able to pay the guaranteed lifelong pensions to members from the time they reach the state retirement age. The undistributed funds are invested with higher risk profiles so that the returns can over time ensure that the real value of the pensions are preserved. All in all, this means that ATP is taking a balanced amount of risk in relation to our objective.\n\nFor ATP's Supervisory Board and management, the top priority is to continually ensure that the business model is contemporary in terms of the objective of ensuring that our members get the best possible lifelong pensions. Therefore, in recent years ATP has worked on optimising the pension product and business model. This has been done while taking into account that ATP must continue to have a very strong ability to honour the guaranteed pensions. But for ATP - and not least ATP's members - it is also important to ensure the real value (adjusted for inflation) of the pensions over time. Therefore, the business model has been optimised in two areas: life annuity with market exposure and a change to the hedging strategy.\n\n## The first optimisation:\n\n## Life annuity with market exposure\n\nThe overall principles of ATP's business model have been preserved so that the guarantee contribution (80 per cent of the members' ATP contributions) is still set aside for the accrual of pensions and is still guaranteed in terms of life expectancy. From and including 2022, the guarantee\n\ncontribution of 80 per cent is divided into two parts for the members who have more than 15 years to go until they reach the retirement age and thus achieve what is expected to be a higher guaranteed pension over time.\n\n- \u25a0 60 per cent is invested with a low risk profile = the interest contribution\n- \u25a0 20 per cent is invested with a higher risk profile = the market contribution\n\nWe call the pension that is accrued from the market contribution 'life annuity with market exposure'. It is\n\nbased on the returns that are generated from investing with a higher risk profile. By investing the market contribution with a higher risk profile, it is expected that higher returns will be generated over time and thus result in higher pensions. When we invest with a higher risk profile, there is also the risk of us sometimes losing on our investments, and the accrued pensions from these contributions fluctuate up and down depending on the generated returns.\n\nA loss does not necessarily have a major impact if ATP can succeed in recovering the losses before a member starts his or her retirement. This is precisely why life\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to avoid a serious reduction of a pension shortly before retiring, the pension that has been accrued via market contributions is gradually invested with a low risk profile as from the time when there is 15 years to go until retirement. Thus both the pensions that are accrued via interest contributions and market contributions will be guaranteed and cannot be lowered from the state retirement age - but it will still be able to be increased via bonuses.\n\n## Optimisation number 2: Changed hedging strategy\n\nWith the adjustment of the Danish ATP Act from 2021, it became possible for ATP to change its hedging strategy for the purpose of increasing the total investment returns while at the same time continuing to guarantee the lifelong pensions with a very high degree of certainty. The changed hedging strategy is based on the special ATP characteristic of members being unable to withdraw their funds from ATP but instead they receive them as a lifelong benefit which is guaranteed from the time a member reaches the state retirement age. Therefore ATP can act as a true long-term investor.\n\nThe changed hedging strategy is therefore intended to allow ATP as a pension fund to get the best of two worlds - provide higher returns and also preserve the underlying guarantees.\n\nThe change increases ATP's overall investment risk as the change to the hedging strategy involves that in addition to the existing interest hedging on the guaranteed pensions there is also added a number of assets with higher risk profiles and higher expected returns from the hedging. This increases the total expected returns from the hedging portfolio so that the expected extra returns can over time contribute to an increase of the bonus potential and thus the bonus allocations. After the adjustment, the overall risk profile of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) will still be less than the typical market product, which is a natural result of ATP providing a lifelong guaranteed pension.\n\nIn 2022, ATP has prepared the business for implementing a changed hedging strategy during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, ATP paid out over DKK 300bn in welfare and insurance benefits.\n\nWhat all of the tasks that ATP solves on the welfare area have in common is that they concern many residents of Denmark and/or companies and therefore also involve the use of a lot of data. There is also legislation involved which is often complex and changing.\n\n## Important money on the account\n\nThe majority of the benefits that ATP's Processing Busi -ness sends to the bank accounts of the Danish citizens are either to cover basic needs or a significant contri -bution to covering basic needs. This also applies to the state pension.\n\nOut of the 1.1 million people in Denmark who are receiving a state pension, approximately 40 per cent have no other retirement savings. The state pension and ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong pension) therefore often form the basis for covering the basic needs for the pensioners that ATP pays money to.\n\nThe political focus on the opportunity to retire from the labour market early has in the past few years grown ATP's portfolio of tasks, particularly in terms of the two schemes: Senior Pension and Early Retirement Pension.\n\nThe rent subsidies which are also paid out by ATP make a significant contribution to the household finances of many people in Denmark. The benefit is paid out to 615,000 Danish households each month. This corresponds to approximately every second household\n\nliving in a rental home and thus a broad proportion of people in Denmark, ranging from young students to families with children and senior citizens.\n\nThe benefits for children with families are also large tasks in ATP's portfolio of welfare tasks. We pay out maternity/ paternity leave benefits, child and alimony payments, child and youth benefits and, not least, the child cheque.\n\n## Financial security in the labour market\n\nATP also solves a number of tasks on behalf of the state and the social partners that contribute to ensuring a balanced labour market. Many of the tasks involve both contributions from employers and payments to employees.\n\nThe self-governing institution Labour Market Insurance (AES) processes about 50,000 cases per year. AES determines whether a personal injury or illness can be classified as an industrial injury. AES also assesses whether a resident of Denmark is entitled to compensation and, if so, how much.\n\nThrough L\u00f8nmodtagernes Garantifund (LG), (The Employees' Guarantee Fund) employees are ensured that they will receive salary payments if the company goes bankrupt and via Feriekonto, ATP pays out approximately DKK 10bn in holiday pay each year. Arbejdsgivernes Uddannelsesbidrag (AUB), (Employer's Training Contributions) is intended to ensure that there is created more apprenticeship roles in vocational training programmes and via Arbejdsmarkedets Fond for Udstationerede (AFU),(The Danish Labour Market Fund for Posted Workers) it is ensured that posted employees within the EU are paid for work in Denmark if their company goes bankrupt.\n\nDKK 300 bn\n\nHow much ATP paid out in welfare and insurance benefits in 2022\n\nThe majority of the benefits that ATP's Processing Business sends to the bank accounts of their citizens are either to cover basic needs or a significant contribution to this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Extra money to citizens of Denmark\n\nJust as ATP solved a number of urgent tasks for the state during the corona crisis in 2021, 2022 was also a year wherein the state asked ATP for help with the payment of one-off benefits to citizens who were particularly hard hit by rising heating costs and inflation.\n\nIn September, the Danish Parliament adopted a law about two payments of additional financial support to the 275,000 pensioners who receive the 'elderly cheque' and how are viewed as having the most difficulty in paying the high energy bills.

This makes it essential that we consider responsibility across the ATP value chain.\n\n## How do we impact the world around us?\n\nATP's responsibility is about what we ourselves do and the mark we leave on the world around us. We believe that it is important that we lead by example and take responsibility. This responsibility is both to the environment and climate, and it applies to our employees and the way we operate ATP as a workplace and business. As active owners, we engage in constructive dialogues with the companies we invest in to influence them towards taking positive steps and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings.\n\n## The carbon footprint needs to be reduced\n\nATP has an ambition of reducing its carbon footprint from its in-house energy consumption and travel activ -ities by 30 per cent in 2025 and 70 per cent in 2030 and to become carbon neutral in 2050 (compared to 2018). In 2022, ATP's calculated carbon footprint has been reduced by 48 per cent and we have thus fulfilled our 2025 ambition. The reduction in CO2 emissions is driven by changes to consumption patterns after the corona pandemic lockdowns. Another factor is the energy optimi -sation of our buildings and improved emission factors that reflect a higher proportion of renewable energy in our energy supply.\n\nAt ATP, we are working in a focused manner on changing behaviour in our everyday lives so that we can contribute to reducing energy consumption and our impact on the climate. Among other things, this is expressed via ongoing initiatives to reduce waste by lowering temper -atures in all of our buildings and by integrating climate considerations into our canteen operations.\n\n## Focus on indirect environmental impacts and robust data\n\nA significant portion of ATP's emissions of greenhouse gases are indirect and from ATP's value chain via the so-called scope 3 emissions (see the figure on the next page). In 2022, ATP has been focused on expanding the measurement of scope 3 emissions to include employee commutes, canteen purchases, external IT operations and waste management. The activities are estimated to emit 4,739 tonnes of CO2, which are significantly higher than our emissions from electricity and heating in our buildings and our travel activities. The majority of these emissions are from employee commutes.\n\nHowever, scope 3 emissions are difficult to measure as they are rarely directly measurable in the same way as the consumption of electricity and heating is. Despite the challenges with data, ATP is focused on ensuring that our scope 3 statements are based on credible and high-quality data.\n\nThe work on estimating scope 3 emissions is an ongoing process. In the coming years, ATP will also be working on improving the data available for our scope 3 statements by not just focusing on our own data but also specifying requirements for the data from our suppliers.\n\nFor a detailed report on environmental matters, please see ATP's statutory report on responsibility: www.atp.dk/ dokument/rapport-om-samfundsansvar-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## green energy provides power to ATP\n\nIn 2022, the Flex platform was launched as a collaboration between ATP, IBM and Andel. The project contributes to creating a green balance between the supply and demand of energy. The platform reduces power consumption when there is a peak load on the green sources of energy.\n\n## Sorting waste benefits the environment\n\nSince 2019, ATP's CO2 emissions from waste have been reduced by 44 per cent and the recycling rate has increased from 25 per cent to 36 per cent.\n\n## Green procurements\n\nIn 2022, ATP had new green procurement guidelines when it joined the 'Partnership for Green Public Sector Purchases' ('Partnerskab for offentlige gr\u00f8nne indk\u00f8b') and also became a member of the 'Network for Purchases with Environmental Labels' ('Netv\u00e6rk for Milj\u00f8m\u00e6rket indk\u00f8b').\n\n## Biodiversity is prioritised\n\nThe first steps were taken on ATP's biodiversity initiatives, where large parts of built-up areas in the main headquarters in Hiller\u00f8d are converted to insect-friendly areas.\n\n## CO2 emissions for ATP as a workplace\n\n|                                                                                                       | 2022         | 2021         | 2020         | 2019         | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|\n| CO2e emissions, tonne*                                                                                |              |              |              |              |        |\n| Direct emissions - natural gas (scope 1)                                                              | 79           | 66           | 75           | 115          | 135    |\n| Indirect emissions - electricity and district heating (scope 2)                                       | 685          | 727          | 646          | 1,000        | 1,314  |\n| Indirect emissions - energy, air travel and driving (scope 3)                                         | 696          | 509          | 681          | 1,343        | 1,368  |\n| Total CO2e emissions (2018 baseline)                                                                  | 1,460        | 1,302        | 1,403        | 2,458        | 2,817  |\n| CO2e reduction compared to 2018 baseline                                                              | 48 per  cent | 54 per  cent | 50 per  cent | 13 per  cent | -      |\n| Other indirect emissions - commuting, canteen purchases, IT operations, waste  management (scope 3)** | 4,739        | -            | -            | -            | -      |\n\n- *Greenhouse gas emissions are stated in CO2 equivalents and divided into scope pursuant to the GHG protocol\n- **The emissions for activities are only estimated for 2022, as data for previous years was not available The activities are thus not included in ATP's climate ambition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the same period, ATP has sold off green investments worth DKK 12bn, primarily listen equities and real estate. The fact that green investments only increased by DKK 4bn this year is due to the negative price developments in the bond and equity markets. At the end of 2022, ATP had green investments in excess of DKK 66bn.\n\nlater than by the end of 2025. This is to ensure that we have the best possible overview of climate risks in our portfolio. And then as an investor, we also want to know which companies have done the most - and which have done the least - to mitigate climate change. We are monitoring this work via a points system where we rate companies on the basis of the quality of their CO2 reporting.\n\nIn 2022, there has been positive developments, mainly among the listed companies. In that group, more companies have begun reporting on CO2 emissions and we are also seeing more companies improving the quality of the CO2 reporting. Where we lack data is mainly among companies that ATP is a co-owner of via funds and listed companies in countries with a limited focus on the climate. On the basis of the developments of 2022, ATP is preparing an action plan for its dialogues with companies in 2023.\n\nOne of ATP's climate ambitions is that the companies that ATP invests in should report on their CO2 emissions no\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP's climate ambitions are specified using a number of assumptions, including expectations for the market situation between now and 2030 and market-related, company-specific and political events. The work on fulfilling the climate ambitions takes place within the framework of the prudent person principle and the requirement that ATP must invest its assets in a way that best serves the interests of its members.\n\n## A major investment in Danish solar power\n\nIn the middle of a European energy crisis and a global climate crisis, this year ATP has directly invested in the company called Better Energy, which is a leading Danish developer and owner of solar parks.\n\nBetter Energy is one of the fastest-growing suppliers of solar energy in Northern Europe with a pipeline of over 10 GW large-scale solar parks. The solar parks are to supply green energy to companies, cities and countries thus reducing CO2 emissions, taking into consideration biodiversity and also at the same time being cheaper than coal, oil and gas.\n\nATP's investment is a lever for Better Energy's continued efforts to scale up as the company's portfolio of solar parks owned directly by the company grows as well.\n\nATP believes that the necessary green transition and the European desire to free itself from reliance on Russian natural gas require a significant expansion of renewable energy sources.  The demand for renewable energy is growing significantly. Therefore, investing in Better Energy provides opportunities for attractive returns for ATP and it will also contribute to the green transition.\n\nFor ATP, Better Energy's approach with an early involvement of local communities and local value creation - for example, protecting groundwater, initiatives to restore nature and promote biodiversity and establishing recreational areas - has contributed to the decision to invest a large, triple-digit DKK million amount in Better Energy.\n\n## Number one in solar energy in Northern Europe\n\n- \u00b7 Better Energy is a Danish renewable energy company that develops, builds, operates and sells electricity from solar parks. Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Finland are the company's current key markets.\n- \u00b7 In a partnership with Industriens Pension, Better Energy owns more than 1 GW of green energy production in the form of 21 solar parks (16 in Denmark and 5 in Poland) with a total acquisition cost of DKK 5bn.\n- \u00b7 Better Energy is working in a targeted manner and has made a great deal of progress in the ongoing development of existing markets outside of Denmark, and its presence in Poland, Sweden and Finland will be strengthened in the coming years.\n- \u00b7 The company's revenue was over DKK 1bn in 2021 and it has a 10 GW pipeline of planned solar park projects. The ambition is to grow the project pipeline to 20 GW between now and 2025.",

        "page_content": "## ATP invests in a large Danish geothermal heating plant\n\nHot water from deep inside the core of the Earth may provide renewable energy to households and workplaces. The geothermal energy is found as hot water in porous sandstone layers below ground (geothermal reservoirs) from which the water can be pumped up and returned again once the heat has been used. This is a stable source of energy that does not depend on the weather, as wind and solar energy does.\n\nIn 2022, ATP invested in the company called Innargi, which is working on exploiting one of the world's sources of renewable energy in Denmark. Innargi will build and operate geothermal plants that extract warm water from depths of 2-3 kilometers. The first plant, which will be the largest in the EU, will be placed in Aarhus. It is expected that already from 2025 the plant will begin providing heating to the residents of Aarhus and it is expected to be fully operational at 110 MW in 2030. This is enough to provide geothermal heating to every fifth resident of Aarhus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeothermal energy requires a large scale to be compet -itive under the current rules. Therefore, it is obvious for Aarhus (and perhaps also Copenhagen) to take the lead in rolling out geothermal power in Denmark. This opens up for surrounding district heating networks to also utilise the geothermal energy even if their heating needs by themselves are not of a large enough scale for geothermal energy to make sense.\n\nGeothermal energy is the fourth large source of renewable energy on Earth - next to wind, solar and hydro. However, it is the only renewable energy source that delivers 24/7/365, as geothermal energy uses the heat radiating out from the Earth's core. This means that geothermal energy can provide base heating to the district heating system and, for example, replace imported wood pellets, coal and gas.\n\nATP is a co-owner together with NRGi and A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding - the latter founded the company.\n\nLarge-scale geothermal energy has the potential to provide for approximately 30 per cent of Denmark's district heating needs. This is the equivalent of the heating consumption of approximately 600,000 households.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The island will be the largest construction project in\n\nDanish history and a critical factor in meeting the Danish and EU objectives of becoming carbon neutral in 2050.\n\nIf ATP and \u00d8rsted win the tender (which is expected to begin in spring of 2023), the energy island will consist of a small dammed-in island that can be expanded with flexible modules that can be added on an ongoing basis and replaced as needed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ATP is investing massively in the car industry\n\nIn 2022, ATP made its third investment in the Swedish company called Northvolt, which develops and produces the greenest car batteries in the world.\n\nThere is strong demand for the green electric car batteries developed by Northvolt. Customers such as BMW, Volvo and Volkswagen, have already placed orders for more than DKK 350bn (USD 55bn).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking the lead in the collection of ESG data\n\nAt ATP, we want our ESG initiatives to be effective, and we have a clear ambition about being active owners and using our influence. The goal is to create long-term value creation. In this work, ESG data is an important precondition for knowing where to focus our efforts and where we can best wield our influence. In recent years, the area of listed investments has a relatively good ESG data coverage, but the unlisted investments are still not as good at providing ESG data.\n\nTherefore, in 2020 ATP took the initiative to develop our own ESG questionnaire which we ask our portfolio companies to respond to each year. Our primary aim was to design a relatively simple questionnaire that focused on topics and metrics that we believe ought to be a part of any company's ESG-related efforts.\n\nThe ambition is to set a standard for reporting on ESG matters in illiquid companies that other investors\n\nResponsibility\n\nAt length, Northvolt intends to produce batteries with only 10 per cent of the carbon footprint of traditional battery production processes. This is mainly to be achieved by placing the factories close to green sources of energy such as hydropower.\n\nNorthvolt's value chain is vertically integrated as the company produces its own active materials that are used to make batteries, while other producers usually buy these materials from external suppliers. The production of the active materials is a very energy-in -tensive process - and it is particularly here that the access to a nearby source of renewable energy is essential for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\ncan also use. This reduces the reporting burden on companies and investors and thereby lowers costs for everyone.\n\nIn 2022, we have seen a lot of support for our ESG questionnaire from other pension companies after we chose to invite external investors to take part. Indus -triens Pension, PenSam, Akademikerpension and Danske Bank Asset Management are now all involved with the questionnaire and with more investors on board that can share information, we will be able to more rapidly expand the database and be able to make analyses of a higher quality. This also allows us to be part of creating a more common standard for how ESG reporting is done.\n\nThe feedback shows that the companies are finding the questionnaire very useful. Several companies have told us that the questionnaire has helped to accelerate their development, for example, in terms of developing policies and processes and identifying specific savings opportu -nities. We are also seeing that more companies want to have their own follow-up dialogues and inputs for various specific initiatives.",

The collective scheme is intended to ensure basic financial security, but at the same it forces us at ATP to be able to justify our expenses. We have been entrusted with the role as the pension company and we administer many public welfare benefits, and our members have to be able to trust that we manage that trust in the best way possible, such as by keeping a constant focus on expenses.\n\nIn order to create a sustainable balance between quality, risk and expenses, ATP works with a balanced approach to cost efficiency. We are ambitious in this area and are constantly weighing the costs against quality and risk so that we can continually ensure that decisions are sustainable in the long run. It is relatively simple to reduce expenses in the short term, but significantly more difficult to do in a manner that is also viable far into the future.\n\nIn a world where the returns are low, expenses matter more when it comes to being able to create good\n\n## ATP's annual expenses in perfect (APR)\n\nAPR is the pension industry's standard method of collating and measuring all expenses related to a pension product with the purpose of providing members with the greatest possible degree of transparency. The standard rates do not take into account performance fees. There -fore, actual expenses will be significantly higher than the standard rates in years with very high returns.\n\nThe rising interest rates throughout 2022 have meant that the present value of the guaranteed pensions have fallen\n\npensions. The level of expenses directly affects future pensions. Even small differences in expenses can, over longer savings periods, result in significant differences in pension payments.\n\nWe are working on a balanced expense efficiency, both on the processing side with keeping expenses per member low and on the investment side by having a focus on where an expense can create returns.\n\n## ATP is able to keep its administration costs down because we have a single product on our shelves.\n\nATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a mandatory pension scheme which allows for economies of scale\n\n- and thus also ATP's total assets, which the costs are seen in relation to in the APR statement. This has, seen separately, resulted in an APR that is 10 basis points higher than if the calculation were made based on the assets at the end of 2021.\n\nATP's investment and administration activity expenses for 2022 ended up totaling DKK 2,394 million or 0.35 per cent of assets (APR).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat benefit members in the form of low administration activity expenses. A large proportion of communication with ATP's members is also now digitalised, payment processes in and out are automated and the IT platform is stable. This all contributes to keeping the expense level down.\n\nATP participates in joint public sector digitalisation initiatives which we will also prioritise in the future, and all other things being equal, this will possibly increase expenses during the investment phases. However, we believe that our process business has the volume needed in order for digitalisation to pay off in the long run, and there are some advantages with the future solutions that can partly outweigh the investment expenses. At length, we expect to be able to keep ATP's total administration activity expense per member stable.\n\nATP's investment expenses before performance fees amounted to DKK 252 per member, which is lower than it was in 2021. The reduction is driven by fewer expenses for external managers as more activities are being handled directly by ATP. It is typically more expensive to place mandates with an external party, which is why it must constantly be checked whether an additional return is created which justifies the extra expense. When ATP assesses the most appropriate placing of funds, we consider factors such as risk-adjusted returns, cost efficiency, specialist knowledge and ESG issues, etc.\n\nThe strong focus on expenses also means that there is continually made assessment of performance in relation to expenses across the entire portfolio. The objective is clear: We need to be the cheapest in the sector.\n\nATP's administration activity expenses in 2022 were DKK 215 million, equal to DKK 39 per member. As in previous years, this is very low both in a Danish and international context.\n\n| Statement of annual expenses in 2022          | DKKm   |   DKK per  member | APR           |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Administration activity expenses ATP          | 215    |                39 | 0.03 per cent |\n| Investment expenses ATP                       | 598    |               109 | 0.09 per cent |\n| Investment expenses subsidiaries              | 225    |                41 | 0.03 per cent |\n| Investment expenses, external managers        | 555    |               101 | 0.08 per cent |\n| Total investment expenses ex performance fees | 1,379  |               252 | 0.20 per cent |\n| Performance fees, external managers           | 801    |               146 | 0.12 per cent |\n| Total annual expenses                         | 2,394  |               438 | 0.35 per cent |",

We are therefore constantly focused on modernising IT systems so that people in Denmark and companies can also in the future see their contacts with ATP's schemes as easy and accessible.\n\n## Future-proofed professional systems\n\nOver a number of years, ATP has replaced virtually all of the IT systems that ensure the payment of welfare benefits in Denmark. A large part of the IT development projects are due to legal changes or political agreements. The systems also handle large sums of money and data and must be designed to work optimally at the best price.\n\nIn 2022, ATP has also replaced the professional system used for case processing related to industrial injuries in Labour Market Insurance (AES). This has been an extraordinary task since ATP and the supplier had to build a modern and future-proof system from the bottom up. The system is a digital turning point for AES and offers a number of advantages in the form of user friendliness, including shorter training times for employees, and far better options for taking advantage of data, implementing new legislation and to further develop and integrate new technologies. AES' new case processing system (called 'ANS') has in 2022 been going through the final steps of a long-term phasing in process. It is expected that the noticeable efficiency gains from the new system will appear over a long period of time.\n\n## The next steps\n\nWith the replacement of the largest professional systems, the foundation has been created for taking the next steps in the digitalisation process. As a large data-driven\n\nprocessing business, ATP has good preconditions for using advanced technologies. Besides the modern and future-proofed systems, we also use technologies such as robotics and language technology to streamline the workflows of our employees and to simplify the dialogue processes with citizens and companies. In 2022, ATP's Supervisory Board decided to initiate a multi-year programme that is to contribute to preparing ATP for a digital future. At the same time, there has also been a strengthening of ATP's Group management team to reflect that IT and digitalisation are critical for ATP's continuing success.\n\n## Joint public sector responsibility\n\nATP is an active participant in the collaboration with the rest of the public sector to develop a simple public sector administration where citizens and companies can have processes that all tie in together. ATP is also focusing on the citizens who are not comfortable with the digital space or who have other challenges that make it difficult for them to handle things themselves.

The founda -tion for the efficiency improvements is a uniform case processing supported by good digital solutions.\n\n## Savings via economies of scale and IT tenders\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration was created in 2012 with an objective of realising efficiency gains from economies of scale of DKK 300 million. At the same time, the KMD monopoly systems that the municipal -ities used were to be put up for competitive tenders.\n\nThe goal of reducing annual operating expenses of DKK 300 million were achieved on target in 2015. Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration has subse -quently continued to make efficiency improvements through more automation and digitalisation, which has resulted in operating expenses that continue to fall.  In addition, exposing KMD's monopoly systems to competi -tion was completed in 2020 with total annual IT expense\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsavings of approximately DKK 260 million which was 30 per cent. The total savings amounted to DKK 700 million.\n\nThe agreed upon business cases have thus been more than accomplished, and there has been released funds for other welfare activities among the state and municipalities.\n\n## Ongoing automation and digitalisation\n\nDigitalisation and automation have in many ways been the driving forces behind the development of Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration's processing work. When the criteria for granting a benefit are objective, automated case processing systems can make the case processing both cheaper and faster while also making the decisions more uniform - and this also strengthens the legal rights of citizens.\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration continues to focus on ongoing efficiency improvements in its operations, among other things, through more automa -tion and digitalisation, best practice operational manage -ment, targeted communication and the use of digital assis -tants. This has resulted in expenses continuing to decrease up until 2021 - even as Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration has continually been charged with new tasks from the state and municipalities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration saves DKK 700 million per year which can be used for other services in the Danish welfare state.\n\n## DKK 16bn\n\npaid out in rent subsidies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DKK 15bn\n\npaid out in child and youth benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DKK 145bn\n\npaid out in state pensions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DKK 12bn\n\npaid out in maternity/paternity benefits\n\nBalanced\n\ncost efficiency\n\nBalanced\n\ncost efficiency",

Rising interest rates, falling equity prices and high inflation have dominated developments and the war in Ukraine has also had a strong impact on energy prices. All together, this has resulted in very negative investment markets, and like other investors, this has also had a strong impact on ATP's returns and resulted in major losses.\n\nATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a supplement to the state pension and today it covers virtually everyone living in Denmark. As a statutory scheme, ATP is, together with the state pension, regarded as a fundamental part of ensuring basic financial security in the Danish pension system, and this has a fundamental impact on how ATP invests its members' contributions. Members must be able to count on their lifelong ATP pensions.\n\nATP's investment approach is therefore prepared with the basic objective of us being able to pay out the pensions we have promised no matter how the market develops. The turmoil on the financial markets in 2022 has not impacted the members' guaranteed and lifelong ATP pension, and this provides a sense of comfort at a time where many are feeling uncertain about their finances.\n\n## The overall risk exposure must be appropriate\n\nThe basic principle of ATP's investment approach is that members need to have a very high degree of security in the lifelong pensions while we simultaneously strive to ensure the real value of the pensions over time. The ATP Act does not require that members' pensions should preserve their real value but it states that it is to be strived for. The guaranteed pensions already include interest accrual via the nominal bond interest rates - and therefore an expected inflation - at the time the contri -bution is made. There are no investment strategies that\n\ncan guarantee that the pensions will always rise with the actual inflation rate. This means that ATP is investing a large proportion of its total funds in assets that are very secure and guaranteed in relation to the future pension payouts. This portfolio is called the interest hedging portfolio, and it consists of bonds and interest rate swaps. The interest hedging portfolio ensures that ATP is able to provide the nominal guaranteed pensions to its members.\n\nTherefore, ATP's undistributed funds in the bonus potential can be invested in a portfolio with a higher risk profile - the investment portfolio - as the risk in the overall pension product is still low.\n\n## The investment portfolio\n\nBonus contributions are allocated to the bonus potential, which is ATP's primary undistributed funds. The bonus potential is thus ATP's risk capital and the returns from this over time are to cover unforeseen expenses such as, for example, unexpected increases in life expectancy, and to partially contribute to preserving the real value of the lifelong pensions. It is with funds from the bonus potential that ATP's Supervisory Board decides to assign bonuses to the members' pensions - and thus increase the payments. Therefore, ATP wants the funds that belong to the bonus potential to be invested in a way that ensures an appropriate balance between the opportunity to be able to pay out bonuses and also ensure a limited risk of the bonus potential being lost due to negative returns. This weighing of expected returns against the risk of losses is a key factor in ATP's business model, particularly when the bonus potential - the 20 per cent of contributions - are invested to take into account the opportunity to assign bonuses to the lifelong pensions from the guarantee contribution of 80 per cent.\n\nA balanced portfolio like ATP has is not an insurance against negative returns in individual years. However, ATP's approach does mean that the portfolio in the short and long run is both more robust to fluctuations in the investment environment.\n\nMikkel Svenstrup, CIO of ATP\n\nIn order to ensure an appropriate balance between long-term returns and risk, the bonus potential has an internal loan from the hedging portfolio. This means that in reality there are more funds to invest than what is found in the bonus potential itself. The internal loan is possible because a large part of the interest hedging as mentioned consists of interest rate swaps that do not tie down liquidity.\n\nThe internal loan and the bonus potential's own funds are gathered in the investment portfolio that is diversified both in terms of asset types, risk factors and liquid and illiquid assets. The risk is high when measured against the bonus potential itself, but it is significantly lower when measured against the members' total assets with ATP. The strategy has been selected to ensure an appropriate balance between the opportunity to assign bonuses and the risk of the bonus potential being lost.\n\n## Dynamic risk level adjustment\n\nATP manages the invested capital with a risk focus. The primary limitation to the investment portfolio is the amount of risk. Are we taking appropriate levels of risk? Could there be a shortage of capital? These matters are subject to comprehensive measuring, management, control and reporting in ATP with a view to safe-guarding ATP against events which could jeopardise pensions.\n\nIn line with the overall principle of ATP's risk management, the risk level of the investment portfolio is dynamically and incrementally adjusted. When ATP's reserves - the bonus potential - grow, we increase the overall level of risk. Conversely, when the financial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreserves dwindle, we reduce the absolute level of investment risk. This means that the risk in relation to the bonus potential (the relative risk) is maintained. The adjustment of risk levels is mainly done via financial derivatives, which are key to the risk management of the investment portfolio. These instruments are to a great extent very liquid and thus cheap to trade.\n\nDue to the decrease in the bonus potential in 2022, ATP has reduced risk on an ongoing basis over the year as shown in the figure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nViewed in the light of increased uncertainty on the financial markets during the year, ATP also decided in 2022 to gradually reduce the market risk in the investment portfolio to below the strategic risk level specified at the start of the year. Beyond the financial derivatives, ATP has also sold off some of the portfolio of listed equities in 2022 to reduce risk.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Risk diversification\n\nAll investors are familiar with the basic principle of risk management: Do not put all of your eggs in the same basket. This also applies to ATP. In order to have a robust investment portfolio with a high rate of expected return, the investment portfolio is managed bask on a strategy of risk diversification.\n\nATP believes that the best returns are achieved by building up and maintaining a portfolio that is balanced in relation to different types of risks, markets and geographical locations. ATP splits the risk of each individual investment into four risk factors which can be combined in appropriate ways to achieve an portfolio with the desired risk profile. It is our assessment that the possibility of being able to predict the market movements and their time frames and effectively execute major changes in the overall portfolio are limited and not appro -priate to attempt for a long-term investor like ATP.\n\nA balanced portfolio is not insurance against negative returns in an individual year, and 2022 is a clear example of this. There will be good years and bad years, but ATP's approach means that the portfolio will both in the short and long run be more robust against variations in the investment environment.\n\n& Risk Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment risks are primarily market risks assumed by ATP in relation to investment and hedging activities for the members' contributions. Market risks are risks related to market value changes of assets or liabilities as a result of changes in capital markets.\n\nRead more about risk and the financial situation: www.atp.dk/resultater-og-rapporter-atp-koncernen\n\n## O perational risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperational risks link to the risk of financial, reputational, compliance and personal data effects as the result of inappropriate or insufficient internal procedures, human error, system error or as a result of ATP's collaboration with external business partners and suppliers. Operational risks include, for example, the risk of errors or delays in mass payments or cyber attacks. ATP aims for ambitious, cost-based, balanced, and sustainable risk management.\n\n## Most significant risks at ATP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPension-related risks\n\nATP disburses a monthly pension for as long as the members are alive. This makes life expectancy trends the greatest single risk for ATP. In addition to including the observed life expectancy development in calculations, ATP also considers expected future life expectancy improvements when measuring the pension liability relative to members. ATP's method and model for this are based on information about its over 5.5 million members supplemented by data regarding some 330 million inhabitants in 18 OECD countries.\n\nRead more about ATP's work on life expectancy predictions:\n\n- www.atp.dk/dokument/atps-levetidsmodel-202 2\n\nIt is ATP's Supervisory Board that decides on the overall frameworks for the investment strategy and risk management, for example, via the risk budget that operates with the overall risk that ATP assumes regarding both investment risks and life expectancy risks, operational risks and counterparty risks not being allowed to exceed 50 per cent of the bonus potential. In other words, risk must be managed so that there is only a very small risk of ATP losing more than half of its free reserves (the bonus potential) measured as the average loss with a 99 per cent probability over three months (ES99% 3M). With a bonus potential that is typically up to 20 per cent of the value of the guaranteed pensions, this is a risk in relation to the members' total assets of 10 per cent. The overall risk ATP assumes on behalf of its members' assets will typically be at around 10-12 per cent of assets depending on the size of the bonus capacity. This is a lower level of risk compared to a typical market rate product with a medium level of risk and 20 years to go until retirement, though such a comparison is made difficult by the fact that ATP's products are different from market rate products. This is correlated with ATP's business model and purpose: to provide basic financial security in the form of guaranteed lifelong pensions that strive to ensure their real value over time and assessed based on the fact that ATP's liabilities are known with a high degree of certainty many years ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory risks\n\nATP's operations extensively relate to schemes and tasks established and governed by statute. Activities may be set up, changed or discontinued by political decision sometimes at relatively short notice. In the same way, ATP's operations or parts thereof are affected when significant regulatory conditions change and new, tighter financial, administrative or other requirements are imposed on ATP.",

In 2022, improved digitalisation has in many ways been the focal point for development in the entire Group. Among other things, our first 'Digital Genius Academy' was estab -lished, which is an initiative to develop competencies that are to make employees\n\nbetter able to develop their digital imaginations, increase their digital literacy and create a greater understanding of what they - and ATP - can achieve with new technology, artificial intelligence and digital transforma -tion. The focus is on expanding the perspectives of the partic- ipants in terms of what new technology can offer in terms of advantages to those who interact with ATP. ATP is currently working on  cases that can, for example, contribute to reducing case processing times, create simpler digital solutions, automate and simplify workflows and  offer support to ATP's many customer advisors in their daily work.\n\nAnother focus area has been diversity and inclusion. In 2022, ATP sent a clear signal that we are a work -place with room for everyone. We offered training to all employees on LGBQ+ inclusion at the workplace and started an employee-driven LGBQ+ network. The Pride week was also celebrated and, among other things, the rainbow flag was raised at all ATP locations.\n\nWe view continual employee development as a critical factor. Both to generate results and also to continually ensure improvements and our ability to retain committed employees. Therefore, we have a number of ongoing initiatives whose aim is to ensure a constant and effective development of our managers and employees. Our primary focus is to ensure on-the-job learning via\n\nchallenging tasks. Experience and research show that the most effective way of learning is to take on specific challenges where one tests something or acquires new knowledge. Challenging tasks for everyone are thus a 'motor' that can both make individuals learn and drive results for an organisation.\n\nWith around 3,000 employees, ATP is a good size in terms of developing individuals. On one hand, we are not so many - so it is expected that everyone takes responsibility from day one on the job and contributes to solving challenges. And with that kind of responsibility comes personal growth. However, no one is in this alone - because on the other hand, we are enough employees to ensure that no matter what tasks you get assigned, there are colleagues to support you, exchange ideas with and have fun with. At ATP, we therefore have the best of both worlds. We are large enough to ensure that multiple people are working on the same things, meaning that there is a professional community for everyone. But we are small enough to ensure that individual employees have responsibility, influence and expectations specified for them.\n\nWe have also developed a number of initiatives to ensure a systematic development of competencies, for example, our talent programme. In 2022, 23 colleagues across the Group have completed the joint talent programme and all participants were designated to take part in the process by their immediate manager or management team on the basis of their skills and potential for further personal development - but also because they had demonstrated an ability or desire to develop others. The focal point for the talent programme is personal development and how one brings oneself into play to both change oneself and ATP as an organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The name 'Fase+' refers to the employment period being from around two months to two years. The employees are typically people with non-Western backgrounds, at-risk youth or people with mental health issues. From its beginning in 2010 and up to 2022, around 300 employees have been hired via Fase+ and in recent years 76 per cent of them have found a job or begun a study programme afterwards, either inside or outside of ATP.\n\n## = Young people in a job\n\nIt is important to keep an eye out for young talent and to take responsibility for their training and development. One of the entry points to ATP is the traineeship. In 2022, ATP employed 27 trainees. Another entry point is to spend your sabbatical year at ATP as part of a special service team in our customer service department. The team consists of employees who have completed their youth study programme and who want some work experience before they move onwards in the education system. In 2022, around 200 young people were employed in the service team for short or long periods.\n\n## = young professionals & graduates\n\nIn 2022, 29 recent graduates started on ATP's 10th graduate team. This year's team comes from seven different universities with students ranging from special -isations in engineering and IT to social science, commu -nication, management, financing and investing. Several internal networks are part of ensuring a professional and social community for younger employees such as the Young Professionals network for employees under the age of 35 and the newly created Network for Recent Graduates. More than 40 young employees are actively participating in these networks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## = Lifelong experience\n\nWe see great potential in employees with a long and varied experience, and we would like to retain our skilled employees for many years. Therefore, ATP is offering five senior days off paid for by the company. In 2022, approximately 400 employees made use of this scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## = Less bias in recruitment processes\n\nIn 2022, we focused on minimising bias in the recruitment process. We removed the option of stating either age or gender and we asked applicants not to use photos on their applications. We also began a training programme for key employees in diverse recruitment practices and onboarding.\n\n## = Gender balance is the way forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity & inclusion\n\nAt ATP, we see the potential of diversity and having a broad range of perspectives and competencies among our employees. Therefore, we want to ensure diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion for all of our current and future colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are satisfied with the fact that ATP has a gender balance across the entire organisation from the top management tiers and talent teams, graduate teams and ambassador corps to employee committees. Across all of ATP, 53 per cent of all managers are women. This year, ATP's CEO signed 'The Gender Diversity Pledge' and their 16 principles for promoting gender diversity. ATP also became a partner of Womenomics in 2022, and almost 200 employees participated in McKinsey & Company's study called 'Danish Gender Equality Paradox in Leadership roles'. The study contributed with greater insights into how employees view diversity and inclusion at ATP.\n\n## = LGBT+ and Pride\n\nIn 2022, ATP sent a clear signal that we are a workplace with room for everyone. We offered training to all employees on LGBQ+ inclusion at the workplace and started an employee-driven LGBQ+ network. The Pride week was also celebrated and, among other things, the rainbow flag was raised at all ATP locations.\n\n## = Working environment certification\n\nATP views the working environment as an important focus area that contributes to ATP's objective of being an attractive workplace. As the only financial company in Denmark, ATP is working environment certified based on the international ISO 45001 working environment standard, and on this basis, it has gained the 'crown smiley' from Work Environment in Denmark as a certif -icate of us doing an extraordinary effort to ensure a good working environment.",

The result for the year was DKK (56.8)bn, and this was mainly driven by the investment result.\n\nIn the investment portfolio, the year was characterised by interest rate hikes, falling equity prices and high inflation. The developments in the financial markets and the war in Ukraine have shaken all of Europe. All together, this has resulted in very negative investment markets that have impacted ATP's returns. The investment portfolio generated negative returns of DKK (64.4)bn which, before tax, amounts to (40.9) per cent in relation to the bonus potential. The largest negative returns were mainly from investments in government and mortgage bonds and secondly from listed equities, while the largest positive contribution was from the holdings of inflation-related instruments.\n\nAs a long-term investor, ATP is focused on creating the best possible returns over time, and over the past many years, this strategy has paid off.

The time-weighted return has decreased significantly in 2022, but it is important to emphasise that positive returns are realised on an ongoing basis, most recently in 2021, where ATP raised the guaranteed pensions by DKK 30bn.\n\nThe hedging portfolio is intended to ensure that ATP is always able to live up to its guarantees. The value of the guaranteed benefits fell by DKK 201.7bn due to signifi -cantly higher interest rates. Correspondingly, the hedging portfolio generated negative returns (after tax) of DKK 207.3bn. The value of the hedging portfolio thus fell as the value of the pension guarantees fell, and the hedging worked as intended by following the guarantees. The result of the interest hedging of the guaranteed pensions was DKK (5.6)bn which, among other things, is due to the fact that the hedging cannot be completely precise. The total result from Hedging was DKK (8.3)bn or (1.4) per\n\nResult and\n\noutlook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncent of the value of the guaranteed pensions that at the end of the year amounted to DKK 573.8bn.\n\nBased on the ambition of ensuring the real time of pensions as best as possible in the long run, the Super -visory Board has specified a long-term results objective for the after tax investment and hedging portfolio corre -sponding to an interest on the bonus potential of 11 per cent. This is a long-term objective, and it does not need to be fulfilled every year - and seen separately, it was not fulfilled in 2022. 2022 was a very bad year for investing, and as an investor we are not satisfied with the returns. However, this should be viewed in the context of a number of years with very large positive returns.\n\nThe life expectancy update in 2022 resulted in a transfer of pension liabilities to the bonus potential of DKK 3.8bn, or 0.7 per cent of the value of the pension liabilities. The transfer is an expression of the adjustment to life expec -tancy due to the actual changes in the past year.\n\nThe result from the Processing business is 0, which is an expression of the fact that ATP's processing activities are on a cost-recovery basis and without risk.\n\nIn light of the negative investment return for the year and the continuing uncertainty on the financial markets and also to preserve an investment capacity to be able to ensure the real value of pensions in the future, the Supervisory Board has decided not to increase pensions in 2022.\n\nThe reserves (the bonus potential) were at DKK 102.6bn at the start of 2022 and the pension liabilities amounted to DKK 575.2bn. The total assets where thus DKK 677.8.\n\nATP's finances are robust. Our business model ensures that we can tolerate losses and our investment strategy means that up to 2022 we have generated significant returns that triggered additional pensions for members totalling DKK 30bn effective as of 2022. The robustness can also be seen in our bonus capacity. The bonus capacity shows the relationship between the bonus potential - ATP's financial reserves - and the value of the pension liabilities. After a challenging year, the bonus capacity at the end of 2022 was at 17.8 per cent and thus similar to the average of the past 10 years. Bonds are heavily weighted in ATP's balanced investment portfolio, and therefore ATP was extra hard hit by the powerful interest rate hikes. An advantage of this strategy is that it stabilises the bonus capacity.\n\n## ATP's bonus capacity over time\n\n## Per cent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group management\n\nBo Foged stepped down as CEO (Chief Executive Officer) on 30 June and Martin Pr\u00e6stegaard assumed the role of CEO on 1 July coming from a role as ATP's",

The Supervisory Board has a long-term results objective which for 2023 seen in isolation is calculated to be 11 per cent of the bonus potential. There are good and bad years for investments, and the objective does not neces -sarily need to be fulfilled every year. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the financial markets and about which direction the world economy is heading in. Therefore,\n\n86 years\n\nThe age that a 67-year-old man can expect to reach\n\nit cannot be excluded that developments will result in a reduction of the bonus capacity and that losses will also be realised in 2023. The objective is based on the principles that members' interests must be a central consideration, that it is the aim to secure the real value of life-long pensions in the long term and that the objective is an ambitious one. The results objective can be viewed as a guideline for how ATP expects to perform in an average year and is calculated based on expectations for returns relative to the risk profile that has been chosen. The ATP Act does not require that members' pensions should preserve their real value but it does state that this should be a goal, and there are no investment strat -egies that can guarantee that pensions always keep up with inflation.\n\nAs mentioned, the interest hedging of the guarantees is a built-in interest component. With how interest rates are developing on the financial markets, it will be possible to ensure that members have better guarantees as the pension entitlements for 2023 are signed at higher interest rates than in previous years.\n\nIn 2023, it is expected that there will still be some work involved in the implementation of ATP's updated life expectancy model. ATP is also implementing a new accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS17) which applies from 1 January 2023 and which will involve significant changes to how the financial statements are measured and reported on.\n\n- www.atp.dk/dokument/anbefalinger-god-selskabsledelse-2022\n- www.atp.dk/dokument/vederlagsrapport-2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 1: Returns on investment activities\n\nIn 2022, the investment portfolio returned DKK (64.4) bn before tax and expenses. The total ATP Group investment activity result after expenses and tax was DKK (55.8)bn.\n\n2022 was characterised by great turmoil in the financial markets. Rising interest rates, falling equity prices and high inflation have dominated devel -opments and the war in Ukraine has also had a strong impact on energy prices. All together, this has resulted in very negative investment markets, and like other investors, this has also had a strong impact on ATP's returns and resulted in major losses.\n\nViewed over the year as a whole, it was particularly the holdings of government and mortgage bonds and the holding of listed equities that generated large negative returns while investments in inflation-re -lated instruments contributed with a large positive return. The returns from illiquid investments, including private equity, real estate, credit and infrastructure were generally negatively impacted by value adjust -ments due to market developments in the listed markets during the year while the divestment of assets made a generally contribution result to the returns.\n\n## T he government and mortgage bonds portfolio,\n\nwhich also includes exposure via financial deriva -tives,generated returns of DKK (60.6)bn, primarily due to negative contributions from United States and European bonds as a result of rising interest rates in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe overall equity portfolio , consisting of listed Danish and international equities and private equity, generated a return of DKK (18.7)bn.\n\nListed Danish equities generated returns of DKK (8.8)bn. The largest positive contribution to the returns came from the holdings of Novo Nordisk A/S shares while the largest negative contribution came from DSV A/S shares.\n\nListed international equities generated returns of DKK (11.9)bn and listed American and European equities made the largest positive contributions to the returns.\n\nThe private equities portfolio includes ATP Private\n\nEquity Partners, which primarily invests in inter -national capital funds, and of other private equity investments. The total portfolio of private equity generated returns of DKK 2.0bn. The returns were in particular positively impacted by a gradual inclusion of a sales agreement on a direct investment which resulted in a significant write-up and the write-up of a direct investment due to solid organic growth, value-creating acquisition activities and optimisation of operations.\n\nInvestments in credit generated returns of DKK (0.7)bn. These investments partly consist of bonds issued by companies with a low credit rating or developing countries and financial instruments. This part of the portfolio generated returns of DKK (1.7) bn. Additionally, loans to credit institutions and funds that, among other things, invest in bank loans and corporate loans generated returns of DKK 1.0bn.\n\nReal estate investments generated a return of DKK 1.4bn. These investments are made through direct ownership of real estate, via joint ventures, or indirectly through investments in unlisted real estate funds. Direct as well as indirect investments are made both in Denmark and abroad. It was particularly investments in commercial real estate, including the sale of the office building North Galaxy in Brussels and properties in the hotel and service industry that contributed positively to the returns.\n\n## The portfolio of infrastructure investments\n\ngenerated a return of DKK 2.0bn. It includes forestry investments in North America and Australia as well as investments in renewable energy. The returns were particularly positively impacted by a number of divestments that resulted in write-ups.\n\nInflation-related instruments , consisting of commodities-related financial contracts, index-linked bonds and inflation swaps generated a return of DKK 11.8bn. Investments in commodity-related financial contracts generated returns of DKK 4.4bn. Indexlinked bonds and inflation swaps generated returns of DKK 7.4bn.\n\nOther items generated returns of DKK 0.4bn. This portfolio mainly consists of externally managed portfolios. The portfolio also includes interest payments to the hedging portfolio.\n\nInvestment return 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP and the ATP Group recognise and measure all investment assets at fair value with value adjustment in the income statement. Foreign currency investment assets will typically be hedged and the return presented in the individual categories is the net return. ATP manages on the basis of asset properties rather than the legal structure of the asset.

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Hedging activity results\n\nATP's pension products are a lifelong guaranteed product and hedging is intended to ensure that ATP is always capable of meeting its guarantees. From 2022, the contributions from members with more than 15 years to go until they reach the retirement age will be split in two so that 60 per cent are allocated to the guaranteed benefits and 20 per cent are allocated to life annuity with market exposure. The final 20 per cent are allocated to the bonus potential.\n\n## Hedging of guaranteed benefits\n\nHedging is planned to ensure that the market value of the interest hedging portfolio after tax fluctuates in line with the guaranteed benefits when interest rates change.\n\nThe interest hedging portfolio consists of bonds and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate on the guaranteed benefits. The interest rate swaps in the interest hedging portfolio do not tie down liquidity to the same extent that bods do, and the funds that are not tied down in the interest hedging portfolio can be lent for investments in the investment portfolio.\n\nThe value of the guaranteed benefits in 2022 decreased by DKK 201.7bn mainly due to significantly higher interest rates. Correspondingly, the interest hedging portfolio generated negative returns (after tax) of DKK 207.4bn. The value of the interest hedging portfolio thus fell as the value of the pension guarantees fell, and the hedging worked as intended. Hedging generated total returns of DKK (8.3)bn, equivalent to 1.4 per cent of the value of the guaranteed benefits. Among other things, the negative result is due to the fact that the hedging of the guaranteed benefits cannot be completely precise which in 2022 has been impacted by the rising interest rates and the uncertainties - especially about the long-term interest rates. In addition, part of the loss is due to the break in the yield curve at 40 years, cf. the interest curve box, as the market rate has been below 3 per cent. The yield curve break at 40 years means that the guarantees that during the year were valued at a fixed rate of 3 per cent and then valued at market rates\n\n## ATP's yield curve for the valuation of the guaranteed benefits\n\nATP yield curve at year-end 2022 ATP's yield curve for the valuation of the guaranteed benefits in 2022 consisted in part of a market-based segment and in part of a fixed interest segment. The market-based segment is characterised by it having an interest rate risk that can be hedged. The fixed rate segment for the valuation of guarantees 40 years or more into the future reflected the expected long-term returns. Guarantees between 0 and 40 years were valued on the basis of a market yield curve consisting of yields on Danish and German government bonds and interest rate swaps denominated in Danish kroner and euros. The interest rate after 30 years is kept at the level for 30-year market rates. After 40 years, the interest was fixed at 3 per cent. Thus, in 2022 there was a break in the yield curve's 40-year point where the curve shifts from the market interest level to a fix interest of 3 per cent.\n\nwill impact the hedging with a profit or loss depending on whether the market rate is above or below 3 per cent. In 2022, the market-based part of the yield curve was below 3 per cent.\n\n## Life annuity with market exposure\n\nContributions to life annuity with market exposure are invested in a special market return portfolio. By investing this part of the portfolio called the market contribution with a higher risk profile, it is expected that higher returns will be generated over time and thus result in higher pensions. In 2022, the portfolio generated negative returns of DKK 0.1bn due to the general market developments. At the end of the year, provisions for life annuity with market exposure amounted to DKK 1.4bn.\n\nHedging activity results and change to guaranteed benefits, 2018-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Return in hedging portfolio, after tax (left axis)\n- Change in guaranteed benefits due to discount rate and maturity reduction (right axis)\n- Change in guaranteed benefits as a result of yield curve breaks (right axis)\n\n*Change in the guaranteed pensions as a result of interest etc. is in 2021 and 2022 shown incl. yield curve break\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1.4)\n\nResults of hedging of guaranteed benefits\n\nGuaranteed benefits are calculated at fair value and the proportion of the year's fair value hedging which can be attributed to changes in the calculation interest rate and maturity reduction are recognised under 'Hedging activity results'.

        "page_content": "## Note 3: Expenses\n\nExpenses in the ATP Group are distributed among the business areas Investments, life annuity with market exposure, Pension, and Business Processing, external parties.\n\nDistribution of expenses between the different areas is based on time registration and expense allocation based on the Activity Based Costing model. Distribution of expenses is intended to ensure that there is no crosssubsidisation between the different areas.\n\nThe investment expenses for the Group are at DKK 823 million. This is a decrease compared to last year of DKK 129 million, corresponding to 14 per cent. The decrease is mainly due to falling trading costs as a direct consequence of a significant decrease in the investment portfolio. To this is added the indirect investment expenses and indirect performance fees which are deducted from ATP's investment return in private equity investments. The statement of annual expenses in per cent stated in the chapter 'Balanced cost efficiency' in the management's review includes the indirect investment expenses and performance fees.\n\nExpenses related to Pension, which include administration activity expenses for the management of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), was DKK 215 million in 2022, which is at the same level as 2021. Expenses related to Pensions represent 0.03 per cent relative to aggregate assets. The ability to keep pension expenses low is due to a high degree of automation and digitalisation when contacting members and a stable IT support system. In the future, just as in 2022, ATP will be participating in joint public digitalisation initiatives and this is expected to have a marginal impact on costs during the investment phase.\n\nThe Group's processing tasks are tasks performed on behalf of the social partners, the Danish state and municipalities and are from the following clients:\n\n|                                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Udbetaling Danmark  - Public Benefits Administration | 1,621  | 1,640  |\n| Pension and Occupational  Insurance                  | 890    | 816    |\n| Senior pension                                       | 57     | 43     |\n\nThese tasks are assigned to ATP on a cost-recovery basis - i.e. without profit to ATP or without any risk of expense. In 2022, expenses of DKK 2.6bn were paid in relation to business processing for external parties, and these are off-set by similar income.\n\nThe increase in administration activity expenses from 2021 to 2022 is a reflection of the general price and salary adjustments and, among other things, higher operating expenses and write-offs related to AES' new case processing system which was launched in 2022. Beyond that the cost developments are impacted by more new tasks under Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration, including the administration and implementation of the rules on earmarked maternity/paternity leave and the phasing in of Senior Pension where parts of the applications received in 2021 were only processed during 2022.\n\nDespite the increase in the total expenses, there has been realised significant underlying efficiency improvements in many administrated schemes, including via automation and the use of new technology.\n\nATP is once again able to keep its administration activity expenses low, as ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a collective scheme and a relatively simple product.\n\n|                                                        | Group   | Group   | ATP   | ATP   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|\n| DKKm                                                   | 2022    | 2021    | 2022  | 2021  |\n| Investment activity expenses                           | 823     | 952     | 620   | 653   |\n| Costs relating to annuities with market exposure       | 1       | -       | 1     | -     |\n| Pension activity expenses                              | 215     | 213     | 215   | 213   |\n| Administration activity expenses                       | 2,569   | 2,497   | 2,576 | 2,498 |\n| Total costs                                            | 3,608   | 3,663   | 3,411 | 3,364 |\n| The aforementioned costs include staff costs totalling |         |         |       |       |\n| Remuneration                                           | 1,611   | 1,611   | 1,504 | 1,506 |\n| Pension contributions                                  | 271     | 270     | 253   | 252   |\n| Other social security expenses                         | 25      | 27      | 24    | 26    |\n| Total staff costs                                      | 1,907   | 1,908   | 1,781 | 1,785 |\n| Average number of full-time staff                      | 2,901   | 3,045   | 2,769 | 2,914 |\n\nManagement remuneration details can be seen in Note 21.\n\nIn 2022, ATP and the ATP Group's employees in Denmark were distributed across locations in Vordingborg, Holstebro, Haderslev, Aller\u00f8d, Frederikshavn, Aarhus, Copenhagen and the head office in Hiller\u00f8d.

        "page_content": "## Note 4: Tax\n\nATP pays Danish tax on pension savings investment returns, no matter where in the world the returns are generated. The Danish tax on pension savings return was DKK (47)bn in 2022. The negative tax on pension savings return in 2022 is mainly the result of Hedging, where rising interest rates have resulted in negative price adjustments on the holdings of bonds. The tax-re -lated loss will be carried forward and offset in positive tax on pension savings returns in the years ahead.\n\nATP is taxed in Denmark pursuant to the regulations of the Danish Pension Savings Returns Tax Act. The tax on pension savings returns is calculated on the basis of ATP's total return on assets. The tax rate is 15.3 per cent. The taxation basis is calculated on the accrual basis, and therefore includes both realised and non-re -alised returns, but exclusive of deductible interest and asset management costs.\n\nThe calculated tax on pension savings returns is partially reduced by an amount equal to ATP's inter -national tax payments such that double taxation of ATP's returns is minimised. International tax consists primarily of pay-as-you-earn taxes on dividends and interest and tax on American commercial income and\n\nis generated by ATP's investments in international listed equities and unlisted investments in, among other things, properties, infrastructure and capital funds.\n\nATP is tax exempt relative to the Danish Income Tax Act, but has subsidiaries which are independently liable for tax and which submit returns pursuant to the Corporation Tax Act. As a consequence of its investment activities, ATP also has tax return obliga -tions in Germany, Canada and the USA.\n\nIn addition to tax on pension savings returns, payments to the Danish state also include corporation tax, VAT and labour market contributions paid on behalf of members of their ATP contribution payments and personal taxes withheld and paid on behalf of own employees. As a global investor, ATP also pays taxes in several places abroad.\n\nIn 2022, ATP's tax contribution amounted to DKK 9.0bn. On top of this, there is the tax on pension savings return which in 2022 ended up being an income of DKK 47.0bn. The tax on pension savings return is included as a tax receivable and can be offset from positive returns in future financial statements.\n\n## Tax contribution - incurred and withheld taxes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe overview above only includes tax on ATP's and the ATP Group's own activities and investments. Tax paid locally by Danish and international companies in which ATP and the ATP Group has invested is therefore not included.\n\nRead about ATP's tax policy and the work performed by ATP to implement its tax policy in investments and in establishing national and international collabo -ration in the tax area.\n\n## www.atp.dk/skattepolitik\n\nATP's tax policy is not an audit subject.\n\nGroup\n\nATP\n\n| DKKm                                                                                                | 2022        | 2021        | 2022          | 2021       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------|\n| Investment activity results before tax on pension savings returns                                   | (65,186)    | 48,936      | (65,829)      | 48,506     |\n| Hedging activity results before tax on pension savings returns and change in guaranteed bene -      |             |             |               |            |\n| fits                                                                                                | (244,827)   | ( 5 6,187)  | (244,827)     | ( 5 6,187) |\n| Result of life annuity with market exposure before tax on pension savings returns and interest al - |             |             |               |            |\n| located to life annuity with market exposure                                                        | (87)        | 0           | (87)          | 0          |\n| Interest income and interest expenses, pension activities                                           | 11          | 8           | 11            | 8          |\n| Value adjustments of owner-occupied properties                                                      | 13          | 8           | 12            | 0          |\n| Total returns subject to pension yield taxes                                                        | (310,077)   | ( 7, 2 3 5) | (310,720)     | ( 7,673)   |\n| Of which 15.3 per cent                                                                              | ( 47, 4 42) | (1,107)     | ( 47, 5 4 0 ) | (1,174)    |\n| Tax effect of different methods of calculating accounting and tax returns on transparent entities   |             |             |               |            |\n| etc.                                                                                                | 153         | 1           | (89)          | (45)       |\n| Tax effect of reduction under section 10 of the Danish Pension Savings Returns Tax Act (reduc -     |             |             |               |            |\n| tion regarding life and pension insurance policies, year-end 1982)                                  | 402         | 8           | 402           | 8          |\n| Tax on pension savings returns for the year                                                         | (46,887)    | (1,098)     | (47,228)      | (1,211)    |\n| Prior year adjustments                                                                              | (123)       | (25)        | (123)         | (25)       |\n| Total tax on pension savings returns                                                                | (47,010)    | (1,122)     | (47,351)      | (1,236)    |\n| Tax on pension savings returns is recognised in the following items:                                |             |             |               |            |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of investment activities                                  | (9,541)     | 7,473       | (9,883)       | 7,360      |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of hedging activities                                     | (37,459)    | (8,597)     | (37,459)      | (8,597)    |\n| Tax on pension savings returns for life annuity with market exposure                                | (13)        | 0           | (13)          | 0          |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of pension activities                                     | 2           | 1           | 2             | 1          |\n| Tax on pension savings returns, Other comprehensive income                                          | 2           | 0           | 2             | 0          |\n| Total tax on pension savings returns                                                                | (47,010)    | (1,122)     | (47,351)      | (1,236)    |",

The investment portfolio market value also includes financial derivatives such as fu -tures, swaps and options. The market value of futures is equal to zero due to daily settlement of losses/gains. For other financial derivatives, the market val -ue may be negative.\n\nThe investment portfolio follows a risk-based investment approach, the focus of which is on risk rather than on the amount of DKK invested. This means, for example, that for the same risk a larger post of bonds can be purchased than equities which are traditionally risker assets. The investment portfolio, as a general rule, consists of funds from the bonus potential. Funds not tied up in the interest hedging portfolio as a result of the use of financial derivatives are available for investment in the investment portfolio on market terms. In practice, this means that the investment portfolio can operate with more funds than the bonus potential.\n\nThe market value of ATP's investment portfolio is distributed based on the type of investment across the entire investment portfolio rather than by the legal structure. For example, in the 'Real Estate' category there may be included both physical properties and also capital shares in real estate companies or real estate funds plus derivatives that are used to hedge these investments.\n\n## Factor approach\n\nTo maintain a robust investment portfolio with a stable return and the greatest possible independence from cyclical variations, investment decisions are informed by a strategy of risk diversification. ATP splits the risk of each individual investment into four risk factors which can be combined in various ways to achieve an investment portfolio with the desired risk profile. The four risk factors are: 'Equity factor', 'Interest rate factor', 'Inflation factor' and 'Other factors'.\n\n## Risk allocation in the investment portfolio, year-end 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The

The year's value adjustment is impacted by the rising dollar exchange rate and approximately DKK 2.5bn can be attributed to this. ATP hedges its foreign currency exposure, so in the income statement there is recognised an equivalent loss on derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe year's value adjustments were also positively impacted by value adjustments from sales and signed sales agreements on infrastructure and private equity investments.\n\nATP Long Term Danish Equity, which must invest with a long-time horizon in Danish growth companies, has in 2022 made its first two investments in the companies called Veo Technologies and Ferrosan Medical Devices.\n\nEquity investments, equity investments in associates and joint ventures, and equity investments in subsidi -aries are recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment via the income statement. Investments in associates and joint ventures are often structured as a combination of share equity investment and loans. Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting. Loans that are an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture are recognised and measured at fair value.

If the report -ing date is different from the Group's statement of financial position date, adjustment is made for significant changes in the market's observ -able inputs and the quoted prices of underlying assets.\n\nThe calculation above shows sensitivities in case of changes to significant input parameters for the Group. The parent company ATP has in -vested in equity in group subsidiaries which consists primarily of investment entities that measure all material assets and liabilities at fair val -ue using the methods described in notes 6-9 and note 11. Since all material assets and liabilities in the group subsidiaries are recognised at fair value, the fair value of group subsidiaries is equivalent to ATP's share of the reported Net Asset Value.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nSignificant accounting estimates are associated primarily with the measurement of private equity investments when the valuation is based on unobservable inputs.\n\nEstimates are applied when selecting the valuation model and assessment of the most important unobservable input parameters, including multiples and discounting factors.\n\nThe majority of the Group's private equity investments have been valued on the basis of reported fair value. In case of reported fair value, the management assesses whether the valuation methods and inputs applied by the external managers are relevant, but also whether adjustments are to be made to the reported fair value due to events after the reporting period.",

A theoretical price is calculated for such bonds.\n\nLoans are valued by discounting the future cash flows from the loans. The future cash flows are adjusted for changes in credit risk. The deter -mination of the discount rate and the credit risk involves a degree of estimation, which affects the determination of the fair value.\n\nSupplementary information about the Group's holdings of government bonds and credit bonds can be found at: www.atp.dk/supplerende-oplysninger-2022\n\nThe supplementary information about holdings of government bonds and credit bonds are not subject to an audit.",

The ATP Group uses external estate agents and their valuation of\n\nthe market level to determine the required rate of return and the market rent. The determination of operating income is affected by estimates to a lesser extent, the determination of vacancy rent being the most significant one.",

Together with the investments in forests, which are classified as shares in unlisted companies, cf. note 7, ATP has invested in forest areas totalling 266 thousand hectares - which is the size of almost 40 per cent of Denmark's total forested areas.\n\nThe forestry operations are handled by external managers specialising in forestry and the returns mainly consist of value adjustments due to growth and to a lesser extent income from harvesting lumber. In some forest areas, ATP has certified CO2 quotas that are sold off on an ongoing basis. At the end of 2022, the remaining CO2 quotas were included with a market value of DKK 37 million.\n\n## Location of forests in the United States\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| DKKm                                                         | Group   | Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                              | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Income from forestry investment properties                   | 414     | 57      |\n| Annual value adjustments for forestry investment properties  | 379     | 374     |\n| Operating expenses concerning forestry investment properties | (326)   | (52)    |\n| Total income from forestry investment properties             | 467     | 379     |\n\nThe group's forestry investment properties are valued mainly on the basis of discounting future cash flow.

The contributions allocated to life annuity with market exposure are invested with a higher risk profile than the interest contribution and the pension that is accrued depends on the returns that can be achieved. When there are less than 15 years to go until retirement, the savings are converted to a fully guaranteed lifelong pension.\n\nAssets and liabilities associated with life annuity with market exposure are placed in a separate market portfolio. The investment assets in the market return portfolio are presented as one on the statement of financial position while other items are not separated. The investment assets associated with life annuity with market exposure are invested and managed based on the same principles as all other assets in the ATP Group.\n\n| DKK million                                                         | The ATP Group   | The ATP Group   | ATP   | ATP   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n|                                                                     | 2022            | 2021            | 2022  | 2021  |\n| Investment assets                                                   |                 |                 |       |       |\n| Cash and on-demand deposits                                         | 61              | -               | 61    | -     |\n| Bonds                                                               | 549             | -               | 538   | -     |\n| Listed equities                                                     | 165             | -               | 153   | -     |\n| Unlisted equity investments                                         | 614             | -               | 424   | -     |\n| Financial derivatives                                               | 878             | -               | 861   | -     |\n| Loans                                                               | 41              | -               | 14    | -     |\n| Investments in group subsidiaries                                   | -               | -               | 401   | -     |\n| Investment properties                                               | 144             | -               | -     | -     |\n| Investment assets associated with life annuity with market exposure | 2,452           | -               | 2,452 | -     |\n| Other items                                                         |                 |                 |       |       |\n| Other assets                                                        | 115             | -               | 115   | -     |\n| Deferred tax on pension savings returns                             | 13              | -               | 13    |       |\n| Financial derivatives                                               | (687)           | -               | (687) | -     |\n| Other debts                                                         | (511)           | -               | (511) | -     |\n| Provisions for life annuity with market exposure                    | 1,382           | -               | 1,382 | -     |",

Using financial derivatives makes it possible to increase or reduce the exposure to market risks, currency and interest risks.\n\nThe most commonly used financial derivatives are interest rate swaps in Danish kroner and euro, which are primarily used to hedge interest rate sensitivity related to guaranteed benefits, while forward contracts are used to hedge currency risks related to foreign\n\n878\n\ncurrency investments. The investment portfolio uses stock index futures and equity-indexed options to achieve exposure to various stock indices, while sold Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are used to obtain credit exposure.\n\nA characteristic of financial derivatives is that their value depends on developments in the value of an underlying instrument, index or the like. As the values change, security is provided to or from the counter -parties. An increasing proportion of interest rate swaps and CDS' are settled via central clearing houses such as the London Clearing House.\n\n## Interest rate swaps help to hedge pension liabilities.\n\n##

The market price may be in the form of a quoted price or price quotation.\n\nLevel 2 - observable inputs: If a financial instrument is listed on a non-active market, the valuation is based on the most recent transaction price. Adjustments are made for subsequent changes in market conditions. For some financial assets and liabilities, no actual\n\nmarket exists. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is made using an estimated value based on recent transactions in similar instruments. For financial derivatives, valuation techniques based on market conditions, e.g. yield curves and exchange rates, are widely used.\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs: The valuation of certain financial assets and liabilities is based substantially on unobservable inputs.\n\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable input data (level 3), the movements for the year are as follows:\n\n## The ATP Group\n\nUnlisted\n\n| DKKm                                                                       | Bonds   | Bonds   | Equity invest- ments   | Equity invest- ments   | Derived financial  instruments   | Derived financial  instruments   | Loans   | Loans    | Investment   properties   | Investment   properties   | Total                    | Total      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n|                                                                            | 2022    | 2021    | 2022                   | 2021                   | 2022                             | 2021                             | 2022    | 2021     | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2022                     | 2021       |\n| Statement of financial position as of  1 January                           | 17,263  | 17,919  | 115,465                | 103,948                | -

Guaranteed benefits include unpaid pension benefits due in respect of events having occurred during the financial year or earlier (provisions for claims outstanding).\n\nThe discount rate is calculated in accordance with the provision basis reported to the Danish Financial Super -visory Authority, based on the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date, reflecting the term of the guaranteed benefits. The rate thus calculated has been reduced by the tax rate under the Danish Pension Savings Returns Act (Pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven), currently accounting for 15.3 per cent.\n\nThe provisions for life annuity with market exposure are measured at the capital value of ATP's pension liabil -ities for life annuity with market exposure. The capital value is calculated with an interest rate of 0 per cent as the pension entitlements are written up or down with the realised returns up to the balance sheet date.\n\nContribution to life annuity with market exposure, called the market contribution, amounts to 20 per cent of members' contributions up until they have 15 years to go until retirement. After that, the accrued pension entitlements in life annuity with market exposure will gradually be converted to an ordinary life annuity and be part of ATP's guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Bonus potential\n\n| 2022 Group DKKm                                                                           | Revaluation reserve   | Retained   earnings   | Total    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Bonus potential as of 1 January                                                           | 25                    | 159,511               | 159,536  |\n| Net profit for the year                                                                   | -                     | (56,954)              | (56,954) |\n| Other overall income:                                                                     |                       |                       |          |\n| Value adjustments of owner-occupied properties                                            | 13                    | -                     | 13       |\n| Tax on pension savings returns regarding value adjustments for owner-occupied  properties | (2)                   | -                     | (2)      |\n| Total other comprehensive income                                                          | 11                    | 0                     | 11       |\n| Comprehensive income for the year                                                         | 11                    | (56,954)              | (56,943) |\n| Bonus potential as of 31 December                                                         | 36                    | 102,557               | 102,593  |\n\nUnder ATP's bonus allocation principles, the bonus potential may be divided into one portion that may be used to increase the guaranteed benefits and one portion that must be retained as an unallocated bonus.

The note is thus calculated with a high realised inflation of 9.6 per cent. in 2022 according to the principles. ATP's board of directors that, with a long-term perspective, decides on the award of bonuses as an overall assessment of a number of conditions. Thus, ATP's board has assessed that the entire bonus potential should be withheld in 2022.\n\n| Bonus potential that could be used to increase guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure   | 18,648   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Bonus potential that must be retained as unallocated bonus                                                 | 83,945   |\n| Total                                                                                                      | 102,593  |\n\n## 2021 Group\n\n| DKKm                                                                                      | Revaluation reserve   | Retained   earnings   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Bonus potential as of 1 January                                                           | 17                    | 146,203               | 146,221 |\n| Net profit for the year                                                                   | 0                     | 13,308                | 13,308  |\n| Other overall income:                                                                     |                       |                       |         |\n| Value adjustments of owner-occupied properties                                            | 8                     | 0                     | 8       |\n| Tax on pension savings returns regarding value adjustments for owner-occupied  properties | 0                     | 0                     | 0       |\n| Total other comprehensive income                                                          | 8                     | 0                     | 8       |\n| Comprehensive income for the year                                                         | 8                     | 13,308                | 13,316  |\n| Bonus potential as of 31 December                                                         | 25                    | 159,511               | 159,537 |\n\nBonus potential that could be used to increase guaranteed benefits\n\n0\n\nBonus potential that must be retained as unallocated bonus\n\n159,537\n\nTotal\n\n159,537",

        "page_content": "## Note 13: Pension provisions, continued\n\n## Note 14: Risk management\n\nThe bonus potential as a share of ATP's guaranteed benefits is called the bonus capacity. Developing and maintaining the bonus capacity is very important for ATP's future ability to generate returns and thereby delivering future bonus. The bonus potential has been increased by DKK 18.4bn in the last 10 years,\n\namounting to an increase of 22 per cent. In the same period, the bonus capacity has only grown from 15.6 per cent to 17.8 per cent, which is due to the falling interest rates over the period that have increased the value of the guaranteed benefits by just over DKK 36bn.\n\n## Developments from 2013-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP's and the Group's bonus potential are reserves that are not distributed to ATP's members. The bonus potential is equivalent to the carrying amount of total assets related to ATP less guaranteed benefits, life annuity with market exposure and the sum of the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities. The reserves can be distributed as bonuses and the added bonuses are transferred to the guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure via the result.\n\n## Bonus policy\n\nThe framework for ATP's bonus policy is defined in section 18(3) of the Danish Executive Order on Supplemental Labour Market Pension ( Bekendtg\u00f8relse af lov om Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension ), stipulating that the aim is to pursue a long-term bonus policy to ensure that the real value of pensions is preserved. In 2017, ATP changed its bonus policy to the effect that the annual bonus decision is made on the basis of an overall assessment of a number of aspects\n\nbased on the bonus capacity. The bonus capacity is defined as the bonus potential in relation to the sum of the guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure.\n\nIn light of the negative investment return for the year and the continuing uncertainty on the financial markets and also to preserve an investment capacity to be able to ensure the real value of pensions in the future, the Supervisory Board has decided not to increase pensions in 2022.\n\nRead more about ATP's pension product:\n\nwww.atp.dk/supplerende-oplysninger-2022\n\n(see the section 'Facts about ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension)\n\nFacts about ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is not subject to an audit\n\n## ATP's risk profile\n\nATP's risk profile is in line with the purpose of providing a lifelong guaranteed pension with a goal of ensuring the real value of the pension over time. This means that safe investments are prioritised in order to be able to provide the promised lifelong guarantees while also weighing the opportunities to generate suitable returns against the risk of losing ATP's assets. The overall principle is therefore that the total risk must be appro -priate in terms of ATP's reserves, the bonus potential. The risk profile for ATP is generally expressed based on a measure of the total risk with an ATP-developed risk model supplemented by a number of risk calculations and analyses. The purpose of these risk calculations is to provide a varied and detailed overview of the specific risks to which ATP is exposed. ATP's financial robustness is assessed by comparing the calculated risks with the bonus potential.\n\nIn order to protect ATP's bonus potential and financial capacity to take action, ATP's Supervisory Board has specified a risk budget that is an upper limit of how large the total risk consumption, which is ATP's quantitative target, is permitted to be. The risk budget reflects the Supervisory Board's overall risk tolerance and is set at 50 per cent of the bonus potential. Hence, the risk budget changes dynamically in line with the bonus potential.\n\nAt the end of 2022, ATP's bonus potential amounted to DKK 102.6bn and thus the risk budget amounted to DKK 51.3bn. ATP calculates the risk consumption on a daily basis. The risk consumption is measured by an ATP-developed risk model that calculates a total risk consumption based on the risks that are associated with ATP's business model.\n\nThe risk target for risk consumption is expected shortfall (ES) with a confidence level of 99 per cent and a three-month time horizon. Risk consumption is a here-and-now stress without risk adjustment and expresses the average of the 1 per cent biggest loss of bonus potential on a three-month time horizon.\n\n## Pension-related risks\n\nATP disburses a monthly pension for as long as the members are alive. Accordingly, increasing life\n\nexpectancy (longevity risk) is the greatest pension risk facing ATP.\n\nWhen life expectancy increases more than predicted, the bonus potential is reduced, since ATP has to reserve a greater amount to cover the pension liabil -ities, as pensions have to be paid out for longer. ATP has elected not to hedge its longevity risk, and must therefore cover losses in case of increased life expectancy. ATP follows life expectancy statistics closely, based on an in-house developed life expec -tancy model.\n\nProvisions for longer than projected life expectancies reduce the bonus potential, but in contrary to for instance investment loss it has not reduced the total asset value of the members. On the contrary, additional provisions as a result of longer life expectancy, reflect that ATP's members are expected to live longer and provisions will therefore benefit ATP's members.\n\nOther Danish pension companies apply a model based on life expectancy preconditions developed by the Danish FSA for the use of those insured via the life and pension companies. The figure below shows life expec -tancy for 67-year-old men and women using ATP's and the Danish FSA's model, respectively, for life expec -tancy presumptions, with the latter adjusted to the life expectancies observed by ATP. It can be seen that ATP's life expectancy model projects higher increases in life expectancy than those envisaged by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's (FSA) model.\n\n## Expected future increases in life expectancy\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 14: Risk management, continued\n\nThe Danish FSA's life expectancy preconditions are a benchmark for current observed life expectancy, based on information from a number of Danish life insurance companies and broad-spectrum pension funds with a total of 3.0 million customers, as well as a benchmark for life expectancy improvements based on population data from all of Denmark. ATP's model is based partly on information about its 5.5 million members and partly on information about approx. 330 million inhabitants in 18 OECD countries. This means that different data are used when modelling life expectancy preconditions, just as the models themselves differ\n\nThe model developed by ATP builds on the suppo -sition that life expectancy in Denmark follows the same pattern as the 18 selected OECD nations and that the lag in Denmark relative to the selective countries will be caught up over time. Data across the last 100 years show that those countries, generally speaking, have undergone the same life expectancy development, although there are differences between the countries on when and how swiftly those life expectancy improve -ments take place. APT includes international data in order to provide a stable prognosis for future life expec -tancy improvements.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risk exposures with the purpose of gener -ating a return are managed in the investment portfolio based on a given risk budget and risk diversification limits. Market risks associated with the guaranteed benefits are managed in the interest hedging portfolio to ensure that the interest rate risk associated with the guaranteed benefits is hedged to the greatest possible extent. ATP follows a well-defined strategy and works on the basis of a risk framework with detailed risk limits and close risk monitoring.\n\nMarket risks in the hedging portfolio and the guaranteed benefits consist mainly of interest rate risks. The hedging portfolio generally has the same interest rate sensitivity as the guaranteed benefits. A general interest rate change has a large impact on ATP's total asset value, while the bonus potential will be virtually unaffected, as changes in the hedging portfolio and the value of the guaranteed benefits will largely offset each other. The market risk associated with Hedging is therefore limited.\n\nATP's market risk primarily consists of market risks associated with the investment portfolio. The principal objective of the investment portfolio is to generate a return that will allow, in part, the building of reserves for, e.g., financing increased life expectancy, such that ATP secures pensions for a whole lifetime, and to increase the guaranteed pensions, thereby safeguarding the real value for of the lifelong pensions. In order to have a robust investment portfolio with a high rate of expected return, the investment portfolio is managed based on a strategy of risk diversification. ATP splits the risk of each individual investment into four fundamental risk factors which can be combined in various ways to achieve a portfolio with the desired risk profile. The four fundamental factors are: The Equity factor, Interest rate factor, Inflation factor, and Other factors. The risk associated with each investment is allocated to the four factors based on the types of risk to which the investment is exposed.  In order to ensure an appropriate spread of risk, ATP's board of directors has set benchmarks and lower and upper limits for the individual factors' share of the risk in the liquid and illiquid part of the investment portfolio.\n\n## Counterparty risks\n\nCounterparty risks are risks associated with financial counterparties' potential breach of agreements entered into in connection with contracts on derivatives, repo reverse transactions and bank deposits.\n\nThe use of derivatives, especially for interest rate hedging, represents a particular risk for ATP. Changes in the value of these instruments will generate a liability or a receivable between ATP and its counterparties. ATP may therefore incur a loss if - for example because of a bankruptcy or liquidation - a counterparty is in breach of a concluded agreement. In order to reduce counterparty risk, both ATP and its counterparties require that collateral is provided for mutual receiv -ables. Collateral is typically provided so that the market value of the collateral exceeds the market value of the related contract by a certain margin.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nLiquidity risks are risks associated with potential non-payment of payment demands or securities. ATP\n\nhas developed a liquidity risk management model intended to ensure that ATP at all times remains able to comply with its contractual obligations regarding providing either liquidity or security. This must be done by ensuring that sufficient liquidity can be obtained to meet liquidity requirements in the short term and the long term.\n\n## Currency risks\n\nATP's investments are, as a rule of thumb, hedged against currency fluctuations in Danish kroner and Euros. Thus, the exposure to currencies other than Danish kroner and Euros is limited. Exchange rate risk vis-a-vis euro is considered to be a significant risk for ATP. However, ATP considers it unlikely that the fixed exchange rate policy is abandoned and this stress is therefore considered to be a very rare event.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nThe operational risks associated with the management of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) cover all potential financial, reputational or compliance-related impacts associated with, in particular, trading activ -ities, risk measurements, contributions and payments to ATP's members and the operation of systems and information security. The operational risks most often manifest as financial losses and are part of the measurement of risk consumption. The Super -visory Board has specified detailed principles for the management of operational risks to ensure that the impact of such operational risks are limited both in terms of financial, reputational and compliance-re -lated impacts.",

As a general rule, emerging market currency exposure is not hedged.\n\n## Currency risks\n\n| ATP's currency exposure   as of 31.12.2022       | Currency exposure  in DKKbn   | Currency hedging   in DKKbn   | Currency exposure  including currency hedging   | Percent of financial  instruments measured   at fair value   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Currency                                         |                               |                               |                                                 |                                                              |\n| EUR                                              | 159.5                         | (92.2)                        | 67.3                                            | 10.8                                                         |\n| USD                                              | 57.7                          | (59.6)                        | (1.9)                                           | (0.3)                                                        |\n| Total other currencies                           | 43.3                          | (41.7)                        | 1.6                                             | 0.3                                                          |\n| ATP's currency exposure   as of 31 December 2021 | Currency exposure  in DKKbn   | Currency hedging   in DKKbn   | Currency exposure  including currency hedging   | Per cent of financial  instruments measured   at fair value  |\n| Currency                                         |                               |                               |                                                 |                                                              |\n| EUR                                              | 281.9                         | (46.3)                        | 235.6                                           | 25.1                                                         |\n| USD                                              | 79.5                          | (70.0)                        | 9.5                                             | 1.0                                                          |\n| Total other currencies                           | 88.3                          | (95.0)                        | (6.7)                                           | (0.7)                                                        |",

The Group's credit risks relate primarily to actual credit investments. Credit investments comprise invest -ments in corporate bonds, emerging market gov -ernment bonds, credit funds, loans, etc. In addition, the Group has a number of busi -ness-related credit risks (counterparty risks), in -cluding receivables, cash and cash equivalents and unlisted financial derivatives with a positive fair value.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe ATP Group provides and receives assets as collateral from clearing centres and other counter -parties when entering into financial transactions. The ATP Group is entitled to sell or relend assets received. ATP's counterparties are also entitled to sell or relend the assets received when the ATP Group provides assets as collateral. Bonds and loans provided as collateral continue to be recognised in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\n## Collateral\n\n|                                     | Group   | Group   | ATP     | ATP    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| DKKm                                | 2022    | 2021    | 2022    | 2021   |\n| Assets provided as collateral:      |         |         |         |        |\n| Bonds                               | 113,472 | 75,693  | 113,472 | 75,693 |\n| Loans                               | 95      | 392     | 95      | 392    |\n| Liquid assets                       | 412     | 1,212   | 412     | 1,212  |\n| Total assets provided as collateral | 113,979 | 77,297  | 113,979 | 77,297 |\n| Assets received as collateral:      |         |         |         |        |\n| Bonds                               | 33,010  | 66,277  | 33,010  | 66,277 |\n| Liquid assets                       | 28      | 45      | -       | -      |\n| Total assets received as collateral | 33,037  | 66,322  | 33,010  | 66,277 |\n\nFinally, ATP's other portfolios of bonds involve a credit risk. As regards government bonds, excluding emerging markets, the credit risk is assessed as being close to zero, as 99 per cent of this portfolio consisted\n\nof German and Danish government bonds at year-end 2022. As regards mortgage bonds, bonds issued by international organisations (supranationals) and bonds issued by publicly guaranteed authorities (agencies), the credit risk is assessed as being moderate.\n\nMarket value as of 31 December\n\n| DKKbn                                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Credit investments                                                   | 34     | 38     |\n| Mortgage bonds                                                       | 86     | 125    |\n| Government bonds excluding emerging markets                          | 335    | 460    |\n| Bonds issued by supranationals or agencies                           | 38     | 39     |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (before provision of collateral) | (83)   | (1)    |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (after provision of collateral)  | 10     | 0      |\n| Cash                                                                 | 7      | 10     |\n| Other receivables, receivable contributions and margin collateral    | 21     | 11     |\n\nNote: The market value of credit investments includes CDS' with a market value at year-end 2022 of DKK (0.2)bn (2021: DKK 1.6bn) and a principal amount at year-end 2022 of DKK 16bn (2021: DKK 66bn). In addition, at year-end 2022 ATP had issued guarantees of DKK 0.0bn (2021: DKK 0,3 bn).\n\nO ther receivables mainly consist of unsettled transactions, ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable. Provisions are made for ex -pected losses on ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable based on a simplified provision matrix using a fixed provisions percent -age depending on how many days the receivable remains overdue. The provision rate is based on historical data.\n\n## Note 14c: Liquidity risks\n\nLiquidity risks are risks associated with potential non-payment of payment demands or securities. ATP has developed a liquidity risk management model intended to ensure that ATP at all times remains able to comply with its contractual obligations regarding providing either liquidity or security.\n\nThis is done by ensuring that liquidity and liquidity requirements both in the short term (5 banking days) and the longer term (1 year) are mutually aligned. Liquidity can be obtained via the sale of assets, but also via the repo market. The net liquidity effect on contribution payments and pension benefits over the year is stable.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nIn the table below, the Group's financial liabilities are broken down by contractual maturity including interest.\n\n| DKKm                                                   | 0-1 year   | 1-5 years   | 6-15 years 16-20 years   |          | Over 20  years   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------|-----------|\n| Financial derivatives                                  |            |             |                          |          |                  |           |\n| Gross-settled financial derivatives, payments made     | 28,454     | 72,651      | 135,712                  | 30,103   | 16,648           | 283,567   |\n| Gross-settled financial derivatives, payments received | (19,888)   | (29,687)    | (52,367)                 | (14,657) | (12,448)         | (129,047) |\n| Financial derivatives, settled net                     | 2,165      | 284         | 349                      | 0        | 0                | 2,799     |\n| Total derivative financial liabilities                 | 10,731     | 43,247      | 83,694                   | 15,446   | 4,199            | 157,318   |\n| Other financial liabilities                            |            |             |                          |          |                  |           |\n| Guaranteed benefits and annuity with market exposure   | 18,621     | 99,917      | 215.409                  | 107,855  | 426,061          | 867,863   |\n| Payables to credit institutions                        | 10,709     | 0           | 0                        | 0        | 0                | 10,709    |\n| Income tax and tax on pension savings returns payable  | 2          | 0           | 0                        | 0        | 0                | 2         |\n| Other debts                                            | 4,434      | 774         | 1,304                    | 9        | 0                | 6,521     |\n| Total other financial liabilities                      | 33,767     | 100,691     | 216,713                  | 107,864  | 426,061          | 885,096   |\n| Total                                                  | 44,498     | 143,939     | 300,407                  | 123,310  | 430,260          | 1,042,414 |\n\n## 2021 ATP Group\n\nOver 20\n\n| DKKm                                                   | 0-1 year   | 1-5 years   | 6-15 years 16-20 years   |         | years   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|\n| Financial derivatives                                  |            |             |                          |         |         |           |\n| Gross-settled financial derivatives, payments made     | 17,790     | 27,299      | 41,609                   | 12,973  | 4,249   | 103,921   |\n| Gross-settled financial derivatives, payments received | (13,819)   | (13,746)    | (13,390)                 | (4,379) | (1,661) | (46,995)  |\n| Financial derivatives, settled net                     | 6,130      | 1,876       | 5,309                    | 21      | 43      | 13,379    |\n| Total derivative financial liabilities                 | 10,101     | 15,429      | 33,528                   | 8,614   | 2,632   | 70,305    |\n| Other financial liabilities                            |            |             |                          |         |         |           |\n| Guaranteed benefits                                    | 18,191     | 97,448      | 214,444                  | 107,858 | 444,100 | 882,041   |\n| Debt to credit institutions                            | 51,544     | 0           | 0                        | 0       | 0       | 51,544    |\n| Income tax and tax on pension savings returns payable  | 20         | 0           | 0                        | 0       | 0       | 20        |\n| Other debts                                            | 7,097      | 943         | 1,552                    | 5       | 0       | 9,597     |\n| Total other financial liabilities                      | 76,852     | 98,391      | 215,996                  | 107,863 | 444,100 | 943,202   |\n| Total                                                  | 86,953     | 113,820     | 249,524                  | 116,478 | 446,732 | 1,013,507 |\n\nIn addition to the financial liabilities stated, the ATP Group have made a number of investment and loan commitments, see Note 17 'Contin -gent liabilities'.

These subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the payment of VAT and payroll tax included in the joint registration for VAT.\n\nOwing to its size and business volume, the ATP Group is continually a party to various lawsuits and disputes. Cases are assessed on an ongoing basis, and pending lawsuits and disputes are not believed to have any significant impact on the financial position of the ATP Group.\n\n1 As of 2001 and under certain conditions, the ATP Group is not subject to income tax on the activities of its subsidiary ATP Ejendomme A/S. If the conditions for tax exemption are not met, provisions are made for both current and deferred tax in the company. In 2022, ATP Ejendomme A/S met the conditions for tax exemption.\n\nThe accounting treatment of contingent assets and liabilities is based on an assessment of the expect -ed outcome of the applicable contingency. If it is almost certain that a future economic benefit will flow to the ATP Group, the asset and the related income are recognised. If, on the other hand, it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow from the ATP Group when discharging the liability, the contingency is recognised as a liability.\n\nWhere it is not possible to estimate an amount with sufficient certainty, or it is not possible to es -timate the outcome of a given matter, information to this effect will be provided. Decisions relating to such matters may generate realised profits or losses in future accounting periods that exceed the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n## Note 18: Paid benefits\n\n| DKKm                                               | Group   | Group   | ATP    | ATP    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n|                                                    | 2022    | 2021    | 2022   | 2021   |\n| Personal pension (current)                         | 16,765  | 16,105  | 16,765 | 16,105 |\n| Spouse pension (current)                           | 4       | 6       | 4      | 6      |\n| Personal pension (lump sum)                        | 69      | 81      | 69     | 81     |\n| Spouse pension (lump sum)                          | 956     | 909     | 956    | 909    |\n| Child benefit (lump sum)                           | 123     | 122     | 123    | 122    |\n| Payments to estates of deceased persons (lump sum) | 40      | 37      | 40     | 37     |\n| Total benefit paid                                 | 17,957  | 17,260  | 17,957 | 17,260 |\n\nBenefit payouts comprise paid out personal pensions, spouse pensions and lump sum payments in the form of capitalised benefits for the year.

Beyond the guaranteed benefits, pension provisions consist of provisions for life annuity with market exposure and the bonus potential. Comparative figures have been adjusted.\n\nThe five-year summary for ATP has been prepared in accordance with the format requirements of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in line with the methods of accounting used by other pension providers in Denmark. Consequently, the return on investment and the return ratios etc. deviate from ATP's format, which is IFRS-compliant.\n\nPlease refer to the description of ratios in Appendix 3 of ATP's executive order on accounting issued by the Danish FSA (Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP), Executive Order no. 771 of 31 May 2022.\n\nATP does not apply the Danish FSA's return ratio. The return ratio tends to over-reflect market value changes in ATP's hedging portfolio, which will not notably affect the pensions promised. As the ratio does not allow for variance in the value creation of the guaranteed products, the ratio does not provide a complete picture of the value creation for ATP's members for the individual year. However, in the very long term, the ratio better reflects the value creation.",

It therefore does not make sense to state separate returns figures for these asset classes.\n\nPlease refer to the description of ratios in Appendix 2 of ATP's executive order on accounting issued by the Danish FSA (Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP), Executive Order no. 771 of 31 May 2022.\n\nGroup\n\nfinancial\n\nstatements\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 24: Accounting policies\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  annual report of ATP for 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary  Pension  Scheme'  (Bekendtg\u00f8relse  om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension).\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements and the  parent  company  financial  statements,  Management assumes a number of estimates and preconditions which affect the accounting value of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. Note 25 details the accounting assessments performed by Management in connection with the application of accounting policies and estimates which are considered material for the preparation of the group financial  statements  and  the  parent  company  financial statements. Accounting estimates for specific items are set out in the individual notes.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  implementation  of  new  and revised accounting standards as described in note 26, the accounting policies are unchanged from 2021.\n\nAll figures are stated in DKK millions. The totals stated are calculated on the basis of actual figures and the rounding off  to  nearest DKK million may result in minor differences between the sum of individual figures and totals stated.\n\n## Materiality in presentation\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements and the  parent  company  financial  statements,  Management performs an assessment about their presentation. In this context, it is taken into account that the content of the Group and parent company financial statements is signif -icant to the reader. In the presentation of the Group's and ATP's assets, liabilities, financial position and performance, it is assessed whether it would be beneficial to aggregate less significant amounts.\n\nThe  assessment  of  materiality  and  relevance  in  the presentation has resulted in changes to the presentation of some notes relative to the annual report for 2021.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the financial  statements  of  ATP,  the  Parent  Company,  and entities controlled by ATP. ATP controls an entity when ATP is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  based  on the  financial  statements  of  the  parent  company  and  the individual subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with the Group's  accounting  policies.  Upon  consolidation,  items of a uniform nature are added together and the following items are eliminated: intercompany income and expenses, equity holdings, intercompany balances and dividends, as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between consolidated companies.\n\nA group overview is available on page 70.\n\n## Foreign currency translation: Functional currency and presentation currency\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented in  Danish  kroner  (DKK),  the  functional  currency  and presentation  currency  of  the  Parent  Company.  The functional currency is the currency used in the primary financial environment in which the reporting entity operates. A functional currency is determined for each of the Group's reporting entities. All of the Group's entities use Danish kroner (DKK) as their functional currency.\n\n## Conversion of transactions and amounts\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Investment assets, receivables and payables in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the statement of financial position date. Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement under 'Investment return' and 'Return from hedging activities'.\n\n## Income statement\n\n## Returns on investment and hedging activities\n\nReturns  on  investment  and  hedging  activities  include interest  income,  interest  expenses,  dividends  and  price adjustments on financial  assets  and  liabilities  included  in the investment portfolio and the hedging portfolio, respectively.  Returns  on  investment  also  include  income  from investment properties.\n\n## Income from investment properties\n\nIncome from investment properties is comprised of the rental income from investment properties for the year and sale of timber from forestry properties less property management and operating expenses for forestry properties.\n\n## Expenses\n\nExpenses are allocated between the individual business\n\nunits either as direct expenses or as an expense allocation based  on  ATP's  internal  model  for  allocation  of  other expenses.\n\nInvestment activity expenses comprise expenses incurred to achieve the investment return for the year. These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to pay and remuneration, custody expenses and transaction costs related to the purchase and sale of investment assets. Expenses incurred in investment subsidiaries are also included in these expenses for the Group.\n\nPension  activity  expenses  comprise  expenses  incurred in connection with the administration of the ATP pension scheme, including SUPP (Supplementary Labour Market Pension Scheme for Disability Pensioners). These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to pay and remuneration, IT operations, amortisation of internal development projects and depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\n\nAdministration activity expenses  comprise  expenses incurred in connection with the management of a number of  large  schemes.  These  expenses  include  direct  and indirect  expenses  related,  for  example,  to  wages  and remuneration, IT operations and amortisation of internal development projects.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContribution income is recognised as reporting is received.\n\nContributions include the reported and claimed ATP contributions  less  labour  market  contribution  and  the  year's adjustment of amortisation on contributions receivable.\n\n## Benefits paid out\n\nBenefit benefits comprise personal pensions paid, spouse pensions  and  capitalised  benefits  for  the  year.  Benefits prepaid are accrued on the statement of financial position and presented under the item 'Other prepayments'.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income includes income for the year from the sale of administration services to external clients as well as related parties. Also included is other customary income for the year that cannot be attributed to pension and investment activities.\n\n## Other costs\n\nOther expenses include expenses incurred for the sale of administration services. Also included are other customary expenses for the year that cannot be attributed to Pensions & Investments under the item 'Other expenses'.\n\n## Tax on pension savings returns\n\nTax on pension savings returns comprises current tax on pension savings returns for the year, changes in deferred tax on pension savings returns, and prior year adjustments, if any. Tax on pension savings returns is allocated between investment, hedging and pension activities based on the return allocated to investment, hedging and pension activities, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax liabilities in respect of pension savings returns and current tax receivable in respect of pension savings returns are recognised in the statement of financial position as calculated tax on pension savings returns adjusted for interim payment of tax on pension savings returns.\n\nDeferred tax assets in respect of pension savings returns, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are included at the value at which the asset is expected to be realisable either by elimination in pension savings returns tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax on pension savings returns is measured in accordance with current tax rules and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse.\n\n## Corporate income tax\n\nTax on results for the year, comprising current tax for the year, changes in deferred tax and prior-year adjustments, if any, is recognised in the income statement. Tax payable and deferred tax are recognised under payables, while tax receivable and deferred tax assets are recognised under assets.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe buying and selling of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the transaction date if the conditions for an ordinary purchase or sale have been met. If the conditions  are  not  met,  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are recognised on the settlement date. A change in the fair value between the trading date and the settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets measured as the fair value above the income statement.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are measured at the fair value at the first recognition and subsequently measured at either fair value or amortised cost.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are measured after the initial recognition at fair value as a result of ATP's business model:",

With regard to debt from repo transactions, the portion of the fair value changes that is attributable to changes in ATP's own credit risk is recognised in 'Other comprehensive income.'  Due  to  ATP's  strong  financial  position  and  the short maturity of the repo transactions, the impact of ATP's credit risk is assessed as being insignificant.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFor  financial  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  traded  in  a market, the official market price is used. Measuring listed equities  and  financial  assets  and  liabilities  is  based  on closing prices from relevant stock exchanges while bid prices are used for listed bonds. If, in respect of bonds, there have been no updated external prices within the\n\nprevious two trading days prior to the balance sheet date, a theoretical price is calculated and the bonds are registered as 'observable input' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor  other  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  the  fair  value determination represents ATP's most objective estimate of the current fair value of financial assets and liabilities, based on the most unambiguous and uniform guidelines possible and, to some extent, supported by management estimates. When determining these estimates, the following methods are applied:\n\n## Bonds, interest-based investment assets and liabilities\n\nFor investments in bonds for which no active market exists, yield curves with the addition of yield spreads and investment-specific premiums are used.\n\n## Unlisted  equity  investments,  including  investments  in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures\n\nPrivate  equity  investments  consist  of  investments  in portfolio  funds,  direct  equity  investments,  direct  equity investments in portfolio companies and real estate funds.\n\n## Portfolio funds\n\nFor  a  significant  portion  of  the  investments  in  portfolio funds, the valuation is based on reporting received from portfolio funds. Equity investments in portfolio funds are generally measured using the IPEV Valuation Guidelines under which equity investments are measured at fair value on the reporting date. Listed equity investments in portfolio funds are measured at the closing rate of the relevant stock  exchange.  For  unlisted  equity  investments  for which no quoted price exists, the equity investments are measured on the basis of the latest market price - either in connection with a round of capital increases resulting in a change in ownership or in connection with a partial sale, based on the value of comparable companies.\n\n## Direct equity investments\n\nDirect  private  equity  investments  are  measured  using one of the following methods: a) multiple analysis where the ratio of the value of comparable listed companies to  relevant  key  figures  for  these  companies  is  used  in the  valuation  of  the  company  in  question;  b)  if  sufficient comparable companies cannot be found, a 'sum-of-theparts' valuation is performed where each business unit of the company in question is measured separately; c) for new investments, the acquisition cost is used.\n\n## Direct equity investments in portfolio companies\n\nDirect equity investments in portfolio companies consist of  co-investments  together  with  portfolio  funds  and are valued using traditional valuation methods and as\n\ndescribed above for portfolio funds. The following factors are included in the determination of fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation and other significant conditions related to the latest round of financing\n- \u00b7 Significant events related to the company's business, product launches, new clients, changes to the management team\n- \u00b7 Compliance or non-compliance with significant predefined milestones and other conditions assessed to be capable of impacting the fair value, including general changes in market and competition conditions and new technology.\n\n## Real estate funds\n\nPrivate equity investments in real estate funds are measured primarily  on  the  basis  of  the  valuations  performed  by the real estate funds. The measurement is based on a valuation model that measures the fair value of the equity where the fair value of the underlying properties is reflected on an ongoing basis. The fair value of the real estate is usually determined on the basis of valuations performed by external estate agents and market assessors. In addition, the managers of the funds regularly perform an internal valuation based on changes in market conditions, which is typically reflected in an adjustment of the required rate of return. Other factors such as the stability of the real estate cash flow, market rent level, location and tenant quality are included in the valuation.\n\n## Loans\n\nValuation of loans is based on discounting of expected future cash flows to net present value using relevant yield curves and investment-specific credit spread premiums.\n\n## Receivables and debt from repo/reverse transactions\n\nIncludes repo and reverse transactions, i.e. the purchase/ sale of securities where, as part of the agreement, an agreement  is  concluded  regarding  selling  back/buying back at a later time. In reverse transactions, the securities purchased are not included in the statement of financial position, and the amount paid is recognised as a receivable. In repo transactions, securities sold are still included in the statement of financial position and the amount received is recognised as a liability. On initial recognition, receivables from and debts from repo and reverse transactions are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value. Interest received and paid is recognised across the duration of contracts. Valuation of repo activities is based on discounting of expected future cash flows using relevant yield curves.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost Other receivables\n\nOther receivables, which primarily comprise incomplete transactions, contributions receivable and rent receivable, are measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is usually equivalent to nominal value.\n\nProvisions are made for expected losses on ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable based on a simplified provision  matrix  using  a  fixed  provisions  percentage depending  on  how  many  days  the  receivable  remains overdue. The provision rate is based on historical data.\n\nProvisions for expected losses are deducted directly from the asset items to which the provisions relate, while period changes are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nIncludes  'Payables  to  group  subsidiaries'  and  'Other payables', measured at amortised cost, essentially equivalent to nominal value.\n\n## Derived financial instruments\n\nOn initial  recognition,  i.e.  the  trade  date,  financial  deriv -atives are recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial derivatives are also measured at fair value. For financial derivatives that are traded in a market, the official  market  price  is  used.  For  financial  derivatives that are not traded in a market, various generally accepted valuation methods are used, depending on the type of instrument involved. For interest rate instruments, valuation is based on the market rate expressed as the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial derivatives are recog -nised in the income statement as they occur. Financial derivatives with a positive fair value are recognised in the statement  of  financial  position  as  assets,  while  financial derivatives with a negative fair value are recognised in the statement of financial position as liabilities. Listed futures for which the margin is calculated on a daily basis are considered to be settled for which reason the market value is recognised at DKK 0.\n\nOther cash and cash equivalents received as part of a margin  settlement  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of financial position, given that ATP has the right of disposal of margin account balances. Securities which, as part of collateral security, have only been formally assigned to ATP's ownership are not recognised in the statement of financial  position,  given  that  ATP  neither  bears  the  risk nor benefits from the return on these securities. Similarly, securities which ATP only has assigned formally to counter-",

ATP  enters  into foreign exchange contracts with external counterparties on behalf of several of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in group subsidiaries\n\nEquity investments in group subsidiaries are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with ATP's risk management and investment strategies. Reporting to the ATP Group Management is also based on this, for which reason ATP has selected the option in IAS 27 to recognise and measure equity investments in group subsidiaries in accordance  with  the  regulations  of  IFRS  9.  Cash-flows from  equity  investments  in  group  subsidiaries  do  not consist of payment of principal and interest, meaning that equity investments in group subsidiaries are recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment via the income statement.\n\nNo  minority  interests  are  deemed  to  own  a  significant share of the group subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities in which the Group has a significant but not controlling interest. Significant interest is typically achieved through direct or indirect ownership or disposal of more than 20 per cent of the voting rights, but less than 50 per cent. In the assessment of whether the Group has a  significant  interest,  potential  voting  rights  that  may  be exercised at the statement of financial position date are taken into account. Joint ventures include entities whose activities  are  jointly  controlled  by  the  Group,  which  is generally the case if the Group holds 50 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  28,  ATP  and  the  ATP  Group have decided to recognise and measure investments in associates and joint ventures under the provisions of IFRS 9. Cash-flows from equity capital shares in associates and joint ventures do not consist of payment of principal and interest, and investments in associates and joint ventures are therefore recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment through the income statement.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are often structured as a combination of share equity investment and loans. Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting.\n\nLoans that are an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture are recognised and measured at fair value.\n\nEquity  investments  in  associated  companies  and  joint ventures are presented under the 'Unlisted equity investments' item in the financial statements.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are properties held by the ATP Group to earn rental income and/or capital gains. Investment properties are properties which the ATP Group does not use for administration etc. as such properties are classified as owner-occupied properties. Properties with elements of owner-occupied properties and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types.\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  investment  properties  are  recognised at cost including transaction expenses. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. A return-based model is used to determine the fair value of the Danish properties.  These valuations are  segmented  in  terms  of  the  locations  and  qualities of the properties. The valuation of the Group's international properties is made by external valuers, since local knowledge abroad requires external input. Determining the return in the return-based model for individual properties is based on the expected rental income at full occupancy of the properties. Expected operating, administration and maintenance costs are deducted. The value subsequently calculated is adjusted for recognised vacancy rent loss for a suitable period and expected expenses related to major maintenance work; deposits and prepaid rent are also added. An external assessment has been obtained for the valuation of market rent, and required rates of return are determined based on external estate agents' assessment of the market level.\n\nThe accrual of rental discounts in the form of rent-free periods, gradual phasing in of market rate rents and other incentive agreements are an integral part of the value of investment properties. The accrual is adjusted each year via rental incomes with an amount equivalent to the difference between\n\nthe  year's  invoiced  rental  income  and  the  calculated accrued rental income.\n\nExpenses incurred in the form of new or improved qualities which result in an increase in the fair value determined immediately prior to the incurrence of the expenses, are added to the acquisition price as improvements.\n\n## Forestry investment properties\n\nForestry investment properties include land planted with woodlands that are held for the purpose of generating income from the sale of timber and capital gains.\n\nOn initial recognition, investment properties are recognised at cost including transaction expenses, and subsequently at fair value. The measuring of forestry investment property fairly is based on a weighted average of fair values of a variety of models. The most commonly applied models include  recent  sales  of  comparable  forestry  investment properties adjusted for size, location and types of timber and DCF models discounting expected future income from the sales of timber and land.\n\nThe fair value is determined by external valuing experts specialising in forestry investment properties.\n\n## Owner-occupied properties\n\nOwner-occupied properties are properties used by the Group for administration purposes. Properties with elements of both owner-occupied properties and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types by square metre.\n\nOwner-occupied properties are recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value using a revaluation model. Revaluation is performed at the end of each quarter. The fair value of owner-occupied properties is assessed using  the  principles  applied  to  the  Group's  investment properties.\n\nDepreciation of owner-occupied properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The depreciation periods have been determined at 50 years. No depreciation is provided for land.\n\nRevaluation of a property from cost to fair value is recognised under 'Other comprehensive income' and is tied to a special provision under the bonus potential, unless the revaluation is offset by a corresponding decrease in value previously recognised in the income statement. A decrease in the fair value of a property is recognised in the income statement, unless the decrease is offset by a corresponding increase in value previously recognised in the item 'Other comprehensive income'. In that case, the decrease in value is recognised under 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\nIn case of sale of an owner-occupied property, previous years'  revaluations  are  not  recirculated  to  the  income statement.  Instead,  there  is  a  transfer  from  'Revaluation  provisions'  to  'Transferred  profits'  under  the  bonus potential.\n\nOn initial recognition, leasing assets are measured at cost, corresponding to the discounted value of the expected rent payments. The leasing period, which forms the basis for calculating the rent liability, corresponds to the period for which ATP, as the lessee, is entitled and expects to make use of the underlying assets.\n\nSubsequently, the leasing asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation. The leasing asset is amortised across the shorter period of the leasing period and the working life of the leasing asset and amortisations are calculated as straight-line in the income statement.\n\nOn initial recognition, leasing liabilities are measured at amortised cost and a calculated interest cost is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Operating funds\n\nOperating equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the acquisition price as well as expenses directly related to the acquisition until such a time as the asset is ready for use. Expenses incurred for repair and maintenance are taken directly to the income statement.\n\nDepreciation  of  operating  equipment  is  provided  on  a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The depreciation periods have been determined at two to six years.\n\nLosses or gains on the sale or other disposal of property, plant  and  equipment  are  measured  as  the  difference between the selling price and the carrying amount.\n\nThe  residual  value  and  useful  economic  lives  of  the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. If the residual value of the asset exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation is discontinued. In case of changes in the depreciation period or the residual value, the prospective effect of depreciation is recognised as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## Internal development projects\n\nClearly  defined  and  identifiable  development  projects,  for which the technical rate of utilisation, sufficient resources and  a  potential  future  market  or  application  in  the company can be demonstrated, and where the intention is to produce, market or use the project, are recognised as intangible assets, provided that the cost of these assets can be measured reliably and there is a sufficient degree of certainty of the future value in use. Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24: Accounting policies, continued\n\nDevelopment  costs  include  expenses,  remuneration  and amortisation attributable to the Group's development activities.\n\nInternal development projects are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets, typically from three to ten years. The useful economic lives of the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.\n\n## Write-down test\n\nIntangible assets are evaluated yearly for indications of value impairment.\n\nIn case of indications of depreciation, impairment test is performed for each asset or group of assets. A write-down is then made to the recoverable amount if this is lower than the accounting value. The recoverable value is the highest value of the capital value and the sale value minus expected sale costs. The capital value is measured as the current value of expected net cashflows from the use of the asset or group of assets and expected net cashflows from the sale of the asset or group of assets after use.\n\n## Guaranteed benefits\n\nGuaranteed  benefits  are  calculated  at  the  fair  value  of the  Group's  pension  liabilities,  i.e.  the  capital  value  of guaranteed benefits and rights (the pension commitment) assessed as a function of the current discount rate at the statement of financial position date. Guaranteed benefits include  unpaid  pension  benefits  due  in  respect  of  events having occurred during the financial year or earlier (provi -sions for claims outstanding).\n\nThe discount rate is calculated in accordance with the provision basis reported to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, based on the zero-coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date, reflecting the term of  the  guaranteed benefits.  The  rate  thus  calculated  has been reduced by the tax rate under the Danish Pension Savings  Returns  Act  (Pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven), currently accounting for 15.3 per cent.\n\nChanges  related  to  changes  in  the  market  rate  and changes in maturity reduction are recognised in hedging activities. Changes related to contribution payments for the year and pension benefit payouts for the year are recog -nised in pension activities. Other minor changes are also recognised in pension activities. In addition, changes due to life expectancy update are also recognised in pension activities. The life expectancy update comprises observed and expected future increases in life expectancy. Bonus is\n\nnot allocated to the Group's business units.\n\n## Life annuity with market exposure\n\nThe provisions for life annuity with market exposure are measured at the capital value of ATP's pension liabilities for life annuity with market exposure. The capital value is calculated with an interest rate of 0 per cent as the pension entitlements are written up or down with the realised returns up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## Bonus potential\n\nATP's and the Group's bonus potential are reserves that are not distributed to ATP's members.  The bonus potential is equivalent to the carrying amount of total assets related to  ATP  less  guaranteed  benefits  and  life  annuity  with market exposure and the sum of the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities.\n\nThe reserves can be distributed as bonus. Bonus additions are transferred to guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure via the result and comprehensive income. Comprehensive income for the year is transferred to the bonus potential. Revaluations and reversal of revaluations of owner-occupied properties are recognised directly in the bonus potential over other comprehensive income. The bonus potential thus rises and falls with the size of the net results for the year and other comprehensive income.\n\n## Cash flow statement\n\nThe  Group's  cash  flow  statement  shows  the  cash  flows for the year, broken down by operating, investment and financing activities; changes for the year in cash and cash equivalents; and the Group's cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are presented directly and measured as pension contributions received less pension benefit benefits. Also included are management fees received, payments related to administration activities, payments to suppliers and staff, and direct and indirect taxes.\n\nCash  flows  from  investment  activities  include  purchases and  sales  for  the  financial  year  of  bonds,  equity  invest -ments, financial derivatives, loans, repo and reverse trans -actions, investment properties, as well as intangible assets and operating equipment.\n\nCash flows from financing activities include minority interest transactions for the financial year.\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  and  demand deposits, as well as time deposits with an original term to maturity of less than three months.\n\n## Note 25: Significant accounting estimates and assessments\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  state -ments  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  the Management make estimates, set assumptions and make assessments that affect the reported accounting elements.\n\n## Accounting assessments\n\nManagement has conducted a range of assessments in connection with the application of the Group's accounting policies. The primary accounting assessments relate to the following areas:\n\n## Measurement of forestry investment properties\n\nForestry investment properties consist of biological assets (trees),  land  and  CO2  quotas.  ATP  considers  forestry investment  properties  as  an  aggregate  and  integrated investment asset, due to the fact that realisation of forestry investment properties usually happens via the sale of the total property including land and CO2 quotas and only to a small degree takes the form of harvesting and selling of the biological assets. Forestry investment properties are therefore considered an aggregate unit which is recognised at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement  and  is  presented  as  a  part  of  'Investment properties'.\n\n## DKK is the functional currency of all subsidiaries\n\nThe ATP Group makes investments across the globe and therefore also holds foreign subsidiaries. It is a characteristic of foreign subsidiaries that they act as investment companies with no independent operating activities, since the purpose of these investments, and other Group investments generally, is to invest the members' contributions and to obtain a return that will safeguard stable pension benefits to the members in DKK. It is the assessment of the Management that the relevant currency for measuring and valuing these investments should also be DKK.\n\n## ATP's business model\n\nATP's business model is to manage and value assets and liabilities based on changes to the fair value in keeping with ATP's risk management strategy. For this reason, guaranteed benefits and associated investment assets are measured at fair value with recognising of value adjustment via the income statement, regardless of the fact that some investment assets in essence satisfy the conditions for measuring at amortised cost price, including bonds, loans and receivables from banks.\n\n## Capital assets held for sale\n\nThe ATP Group makes continuous adjustments to the invested  capital, in which  connection  management decisions are continuously made regarding the sale of assets. This also includes illiquid assets with a longer sale\n\nprocess. The Management may decide, for example, to sell one property rather than investing in other properties which are at a different developmental stage or in another location. ATP considers this to be continuous portfolio management and does not consider the assets as 'assets held for sale' in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\n## Measuring associated companies, joint ventures and group subsidiaries at fair value\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are measured in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  parent company financial statements at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 with reference to the special provisions of IAS  28,  associated  companies,  applicable  to  certain investment  companies,  including  pension  companies. Equity investments in group subsidiaries are also measured at fair value in ATP's annual accounts. The Management justifies this policy by these investments being considered equal to other investments in ATP's business model in which assets and liabilities are managed and assessed on the basis of changes to the fair value in accordance with ATP's risk management strategy in accordance with the above description of ATP's business model.\n\n## Activation of tax-related losses for deferral\n\nATP's  taxable  income  can  be  strongly  impacted  by changes to interest rates where interest rates will lead to price declines on the holdings of bonds and swaps. This mainly originates from the hedging activities, where fluctu -ations have no impact on the ability to generate future profits.\n\nATP is taxed on the notional gains of price changes, which is why price gains in one year can result in a large taxable income  while  subsequent  price  declines  can  result  in tax-related losses for deferral. The tax value of a loss for deferral is activated as the management deems that the losses will be used at a future date. ATP has - when disregarding the impact of interest rate changes - an underlying positive taxable income consisting of interest income from bonds, loans and swaps and income from investment properties and forest investments that can be offset in the taxable losses for deferral.\n\n## Presentation of loans forming an integral part of investments in equities\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures and equity investments in other companies are often structured as a combination of equity investment and loans to the companies in question. In such instances where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and  equity  investment  and  where  there  is  no  significant external  financing  in  the  company  generally,  the  risk  of",

        "page_content": "## Note 25: Significant accounting estimates and assessments, continued\n\nthe loan is considered to be identical with the risk of the equity investment. ATP considers such loans as an integral part of the equity investment and therefore presents both the loan and the equity investment as equity investments which are both measured at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement.\n\n## The bonus potential\n\nATP and the ATP Group is a self-governing institution, settled by a legislative act, and therefore has no owners in the traditional sense of the word such as a public limited company  with  shareholders.  ATP  and  the  ATP  Group therefore do not have equity as such, but non-distributed bonus potential is considered equity by nature as this item  is  included  in  the  Group  capital  base  and  satisfies the definition of equity in accordance with the regulations according to which the ATP Group files its financial state -ments.\n\nFor the assessment of accounting regulations (IAS 32, Financial  instruments:  Presentation)  the  basis  used  is that the bonus potential does not constitute a contractual obligation, and that it is ATP's Board which, within the framework of the ATP Act, assesses and determines the transfer of bonus to members' guaranteed benefits or life annuity with market exposure.\n\nThe comprehensive income for the year is transferred to ATP's  and  the  Group's  bonus  potential.  The  comprehensive income for the year includes net results for the year plus revaluation or impairment losses for owner-occupied properties for the year.\n\nThe  bonus  potential  is  used  to  increase  the  future guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure on an ongoing basis. If ATP's Supervisory Board elects to assign bonuses and increase members' pensions, the bonus assignation will be presented as an expense in the income statement.\n\n## Accounting estimates\n\nMeasuring the accounting value of certain assets and liabilities requires estimations and assumptions regarding future events. The Management base their estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable and relevant under the circumstances. ATP's Management considers the following estimations to be central to the preparation of the consolidated financial statement:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to determining fair value of equity investments, bonds and loans are described in notes 7 and 8.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to the valuation of the Group's investment properties are described in note 9.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to the valuation of the Group's derivatives are described in note 11.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to valuing guaranteed benefits are primarily concerned with discounting factor and future life expectancy for ATP's members. For life annuity with market exposure, the estimates only concern expectations about future life expectancies. Note 13 states the primary assumptions applied in connection with valuing guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Note 26: New accounting regulations\n\n## Implementation of changes to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme'\n\nThe 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour  Market  Supplementary  Pension  Scheme'  was effective as of 1 January 2022 changed and updated in a number of areas. The most significant change impacting the annual report is that provisions for Life annuity with market  exposure  must  be  presented  in  a  separate liability item in the statement of financial position and that investment  activities  associated  with  Life  annuity  with market exposure are to be presented in a single item on the statement of financial position regardless of what kind of investment it is.\n\nChanges to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reports for  the  Danish  Labour  Market  Supplementary  Pension Scheme' have been implemented without it having an impact on the result, asset sum or the bonus potential.\n\n## Implementation  of  new  or  changed  international accounting standards\n\nEffective from 1 January 2022, the ATP Group and ATP have implemented the following new or revised standards and interpretations:\n\n- \u00b7 Revised IFRS 16, Covid-19 related lease concessions extended for concessions up to and including 30/6/2022\n- \u00b7 Revised IFRS 3, References to framework\n- \u00b7  Revised  IAS  16,  Income  from  fixed  assets  being constructed\n- \u00b7 Revised IAS 37, Loss-generating contracts - costs for the fulfilment of the contract\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS's 2018-2020 Cycle\n\nAll standards and interpretation contributions have been implemented  without  having  an  impact  on  the  annual report for the ATP Group and ATP.\n\n## Standards and interpretations that have not yet taken effect\n\nIFRS 17, Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17, 'Insurance contracts' has been approved for use in the EU and applies to the fiscal year commencing 1\n\nJanuary 2023 and will be implemented in 2023.\n\nThe  implementation  of  IFRS  17  will  have  a  significant impact on ATP and the ATP Group on its recognition and measurement and how this is presented.\n\nThe most significant areas are reviewed below:\n\n## Method for measuring pension liabilities\n\nIFRS  17  introduces  a  uniform  method  for  recognising, measuring and presenting pension liabilities. The value of pension liabilities is measured as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows with the addition of the profit margin. Fulfilment cash  flows  consist  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows, discounting  effect  and  a  risk  adjustment  to  take  into account non-financial risks.\n\nThe pension liabilities must be measured by the general method,  the  variable  margin  method  or  the  premium allocation method. ATP expects to be able to use the variable margin method as ATP's contracts are characterised by being contracts with elements of direct participation.\n\nATP  does  not  sign  contracts  with  members  as  the 'contract'  between  ATP  and  its  members  is  defined  in legislation.  The  contracts  must  be  divided  into  annual cohorts and grouped based on whether they are 'loss making', 'potentially loss making' or 'other'. All of ATP's contracts are grouped in the 'other' category, as at the time of contribution they are neither loss making or potentially loss making. ATP has chosen to group contracts into annual cohorts on the basis of the tariff year to which the ATP contributions concern.\n\n## Expected future cash flows\n\nWhen  measuring  the  expected  future  cash  flows,  cash flows  in  the  collective  reserves  consisting  of  the  bonus potential  and  the  long-term  supplementary  provisions are included, cf. below, regardless of whether these are expected to be paid out to current or future members.\n\nAll funds are paid to ATP's members, and ATP has no profit in delivering the services, which is why ATP's profit margin will always be zero.\n\n## Discounting\n\nThe discounting factors that are used to measure the value of  the  guaranteed  benefits  are  calculated  based  on  an",

        "page_content": "underlying interest curve. From now on, the interest curve will be adjusted by taking into account the illiquidity of the liabilities and by an adjustment of how the interest curve is specified in the long run.\n\nThe adjustment of the interest curve results in liabilities with a 30-year term using a forward interest rate of 3 per cent to calculate the risk-free interest curve. The risk-free interest curve is supplemented with an illiquidity range that reflects the illiquidity of the liabilities. The adjustment of the interest curve only has an impact on the book value of ATP's guaranteed benefits and therefore has no impact on the pensions for ATP's members.\n\nAll in all, the adjusted interest curve means that the book value  of  the  guaranteed  benefits  as  of  1  January  2023 are reduced by DKK 35.2bn, of which DKK 3.0bn impact the  bonus  potential  while  DKK  37.3bn  are  included  in  a separate reserve called 'Langsigtet Supplerende Hens\u00e6t -telse (LSH)' ('Long-term Supplementary Provisions) and DKK 1.0bn is a risk adjustment for non-financial risks.\n\nThe LSH will initially be calculated as the difference between guaranteed benefits calculated excluding illiquidity ranges and  guaranteed  benefits  calculated  including  illiquidity ranges. The risk adjustment is also deducted from the LSH.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a risk adjustment that amounts to a reservation that ATP makes to take into account the uncertainty  associated  with  non-financial  risks  in  the measurement of the future cash flows. The risk adjustment is expected to amount to DKK 1.0bn as at 1/1 2023.\n\n## Changed presentation\n\nIFRS17 introduces a number of mandatory accounting items that result in a significant change to how the income statement is presented.\n\nInsurance-related  turnover  consists  of  the  expected discharge of pension benefits and the expected discharge of expenses that were part of the pension provisions at the start of the accounting period.\n\nInsurance-related expenses consist of payments of pension benefits and administration and investment expenses.\n\nInsurance-related financial income or expenses consist of shorter maturity periods and interest changes ad will also\n\ninclude the interest on the long-term supplementary provisions and the bonus potential, cf. below.\n\n## Result of investment and insurance activities\n\nUnder IFRS 4, the bonus potential is presented and treated as a kind of equity that the result for the year is transferred to. Under IFRS 17, the bonus potential is part of the pension provisions which is why the bonus potential accrues interest matching the returns that have not been allocated  to  the  guaranteed  benefits,  life  annuity  with market exposure and long-term supplementary provisions. The interest accrued to the bonus potential means that the income statement for ATP will show a result of zero.\n\nFrom now on, the contribution incomes are not included in the income statement but rather increase the provisions on the balance sheet. Changes to provisions due to life expectancy updates or the allocation of bonuses do not impact expected or actual payments within the accounting year. These changes are therefore not included in the income statement but are instead made as reclassifications within the pension provisions.\n\n## Implementation\n\nATP expects to use the retrospective method and measure the pension provisions as if IFRS 17 had always been applied. The profit margin has always been zero DKK\n\nThe pension provisions as of 1 January 2023 are expected to be adjusted to the measurement method below:\n\n| Financial statement item (DKK bn)   | IFRS4   |   IFRS17 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Guaranteed benefits                 | 573.8   |    538.6 |\n| Life annuity with market exposure   | 1.4     |      1.4 |\n| Risk adjustment                     | -       |      1   |\n| Long-term supplementary provisions  | -       |     37.3 |\n| Bonus potential                     | 102.6   |     99.6 |\n| Total pension provisions            | 677.8   |    677.8 |\n\n## Other accounting standards\n\nIn addition to IFRS 17, there has also been issued a number of changed standards that are expected to be implemented in 2023 and 2024. None of these are expected to have a significant impact on the submission of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements have been prepared in ac -cordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Or -der on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supple -mentary Pension Scheme' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the parent company's assets, liabilities and fi -nancial position as of 31 December 2022 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the parent com -pany for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Stand -ards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with ad -ditional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Ex -ecutive  Order  on  Financial  Reporting  by  the  Danish  Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle  rapporter  for  Arbejdsmarkedets  Till\u00e6gspension  available in Danish only).\n\n## Basis of opinion\n\nWe have conducted our audit in accordance with the Finan -cial Supervisory Authority's executive order on auditing of the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme, AES the Labour Market Occupational Diseases Fund, LD - the Em -ployees' Capital Pension Fund and in accordance with inter -national auditing standards and any additional requirements applicable in Denmark. This requires that we comply with ethi -cal requirements and plan and perform our audit with a view to obtaining reasonable assurance that the consolidated finan -cial statements and parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nThe audit is planned and executed in such a way that we have assessed the business processes and internal control proce -dures, including the risk management planned by the manage -ment that is directed towards the rendering of accounts and essential business risks.\n\nAn audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain au -dit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in consolidat -ed financial statements and parent company financial state -ments. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or errors.  In  making  these  risk  assessments,  the  auditors  con -sider  internal  controls  relevant  to  the  Danish  Labour  Market Supplementary Pension Fund's preparation of consolidated fi -nancial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view. The aim is to develop auditing actions that are appropriate for the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the account -ing policies applied by Management and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated finan -cial statements and parent company financial statements. Our audit has covered the significant aspects and areas of risk, and we believe that the auditory evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Statement on the Management's review\n\nThe Management is responsible for the Management's review.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements does not include the Man -agement's review, and we do not express any kind of opinion on the Management's review.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements, it is our responsibility to read the Management's review and in this con -nection consider whether it is significantly inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, the parent company's finan -cial  statements  or  the  knowledge  we  gained  during  the  audit or if there is otherwise found to be significant misinformation.\n\nIt  is  furthermore  our  responsibility  to  consider  whether  the Management's review contains the information required pur -suant to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'.\n\nBased on the work performed, we believe that the Manage -ment's review is in accordance with the consolidated finan -cial  statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements and  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'. We have not found any material misstatement in the Management's review.\n\n## To the Board of Representatives\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial  statements  and parent  company  financial  statements  of  the  Danish  Labour Market  Supplementary  Pension  Fund  (ATP)  for  the  financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022, comprising the income statement,  statement  of  comprehensive  income,  statement of  financial  position,  cash flow statement and notes, includ -ing the accounting policies for the Group as well as the par -ent company. The consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements have been prepared in ac -cordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Or -der on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Sup -plementary Pension Scheme' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the parent company's assets, liabilities and fi -nancial position as of 31 December 2022 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the parent com -pany for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Stand -ards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with ad -ditional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Ex -ecutive  Order  on  Financial  Reporting  by  the  Danish  Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle  rapporter  for  Arbejdsmarkedets  Till\u00e6gspension  available in Danish only).\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our audit statement to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with international au -diting  standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibility according to these standards and requirements is described in detail in the section 'Audi -tors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements' in the auditors' report. We are independent of the Group in accord -ance  with  the  International  Ethics  Standards  Board  for  Ac -countant's international guidelines for accountant ethics (IES -BA Code) and the additional ethical requirements that apply in Denmark, and we have also fulfilled our other ethical obliga -tions pursuant to these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and ap -propriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no prohibited auditing servic -es have been provided pursuant to Article 5(1) of EU Directive 537/2014.\n\nC e n t r a l r e l a t i o n s h i p\n\nA u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t\n\nWe were initially selected as auditors for the Danish Labour Market  Supplementary  Pension  Fund  on  4  February  2009, and have been re-elected annually by representative vote for a total period of 14 years up to and including fiscal year 2022. We were re-elected on 9 February 2019 following a tender procedure.\n\n## Key audit elements\n\nKey audit elements are those elements which, in our profes -sional opinion, were most important to our audit of the con -solidated  financial  statements  and  parent  company  finan -cial statements for the fiscal year 1 January - 31 December 2022. These elements were processed as a part of our audit of the consolidated statements and parent company finan -cial statements as a whole and the preparing of our opinion regarding this. We do not provide any separate opinion about these elements.\n\n## Measuring unlisted investments\n\nUnlisted investments account for DKK 153.1bn as of 31 December 2022 (2021: DKK 165.7bn) for the Group.\n\nUnlisted investments consist of investment in real estate, capital funds,  infrastructure  funds,  private  equity  and  credit  portfolios. Measuring unlisted investments is considered a key element for the audit, as such measurement is affected by management estimates and assumptions regarding future events and particularly for 2022, the macro-economic uncertainties.\n\nIt  is  our  assessment  that  the  primary  risks  relate  to  changes  to assumptions and the methods and models applied. Changes to as -sumptions and the methods and models applied can significantly affect the measuring of unlisted investments.\n\nAssumptions with the greatest degree of management estimation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of future cash-flows\n- \u00b7 Determination of return requirement\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation multiples\n- \u00b7 Determination of yield curve and credit spread supplement\n\nManagement has provided details of measurement of unlisted in -vestments in Note 15, Financial assets and liabilities and returns and in Note 12, Fair value disclosure.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the valuation of unlisted investment undertaken by the management and assessed the determined assumptions and the methods and models applied.\n\nOur review included the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of controls for valuation of unlisted investments, including procedures for determining assumptions.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessment of the preconditions with the most management estimates, including the macro-economic uncertainties and their impact on these.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of the applied methods and models by applying our industry insight and experience focusing on such issues as changes compared with the previous year.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report, continued\n\n## Measuring guaranteed benefits\n\nFor the Group, guaranteed benefits represent DKK 573.8bn as of 31 December 2022 (2021: DKK 787.8bn).\n\n## K e y e l e m e n t\n\n## A u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t\n\nMeasuring guaranteed benefits is considered a key element of the audit, as the calculation of guaranteed benefits is a complex issue which is to a large extent subject to account -ing estimations based on management assessments and assumptions regarding future events. It is our assessment that the primary risks relate to changes to assumptions and applied methods and models. Changes to assumptions and applied methods and models can have significant impact on the measurement of guaranteed benefits.\n\nAreas  involving  the  greatest  degree  of  management  esti mates include:\n\n-\n\n- \u00b7 Models for valuing guaranteed benefits\n- \u00b7 Calculating future life expectancy (the life expectancy model SAINT).\n- \u00b7 Determining the discount rate.\n\nThe Management has provided a description of the meas -uring of guaranteed benefits in Note 13, pension provisions.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the valua -tion of guaranteed benefits performed by Management and assessed the model applied and the determined assump -tions.\n\nOur auditing activities, in which we have included our own, internationally qualified actuaries, have included the follow -ing elements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessment of controls in actuary models, data col -lection and analysis and procedures for determining assumptions.\n- Independent actuary assessment of applied data, methods, models and assumptions relative to accept -ed actuarial standards, the historic development and trends.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of changes to applied assumptions and applied methods and models relative to last year and developments in industry standards and practices.\n- \u00b7 Independent recalculation of Guaranteed Benefits in an in-house developed model based on ATP's data.\n\n## Management's  responsibility  for  the  consolidated  financial statements and the parent company financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidat -ed financial statements and parent company financial state -ments that provide a true and fair representation in accord -ance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with Danish disclosure re -quirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Re -porting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter  for  Arbe -jdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension). Management is also respon -sible for the internal controls considered necessary by Man -agement to prepare consolidated  financial  statements  and parent company financial statements that are free from ma -terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements and parent company financial statements, Management is re -sponsible for assessing the Group's and the parent compa -ny's ability to continue their operations; for providing informa -tion  on  matters relating to the continued operations, where relevant; and for preparing consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless Management intends to either liquidate the Group or the parent company or cease op -erations or has no other realistic alternative than doing this.\n\n## Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements\n\nOur goal is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the con -solidated financial statements and parent company financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report with an opinion. A high degree of assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conduct -ed in accordance with international auditing standards and in  accordance  with  additional  Danish  requirements  will  al -ways identify material misstatement where such exists. Mis -statements may arise as a result of fraud or error and may be deemed to be material if it could reasonably be expected that they, separately or collectively, affect the financial decisions made by the users on the basis of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with interna -tional auditing standards and the additional requirements ap -plicable in Denmark, we make professional judgements and maintain professional scepticism during our audit. Moreover:\n\n- \u00b7 We identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures in response to these risks and we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not identifying material misstatement result -ing from fraud is higher than in connection with material misstatement resulting from error as fraud may comprise conspiracy, forgery, deliberate omission, misrepresenta -tion or override of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 We obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  pur -pose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 We determine whether the accounting policies applied by Management are appropriate and whether the account -\n\ng estimates and related information prepared by Man -agement are reasonable.\n\n- \u00b7 We express an opinion on whether Management's prepa -ration of the consolidated financial statements and par -ent  company  financial  statements  based  on  the  go -ing concern basis of accounting is appropriate and on whether, based on the audit evidence obtained, material uncertainty is attached to events or conditions that may give rise to significant doubt about the Group's and the company's ability to continue their operations. If we ex -press the opinion that there is material uncertainty, we must in our auditors' report draw attention to information thereon in the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements or, if such information is insufficient, we must modify our opinion. Our opinions are based on the audit evidence obtained until the date of our auditors' report. Future events or conditions may, however, result in the Group and the company becoming unable to continue operations.\n- \u00b7 We consider the overall presentation, structure and con -tent of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial  statements,  including  disclosures  in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial state -ments and parent company financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events in such a way that they provide a true and fair view thereof.\n- \u00b7 We  obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence about the financial information regarding the entities or business activities in the Group for use for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial statements. We are responsible for directing, supervis -ing and conducting the consolidated financial statements audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe  communicate  with  the  senior  management  on,  among other  things,  the  planned  scope  and  timing  of  the  audit  as well as significant audit observations, including any signifi -cant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  submit  a  statement  to  the  senior  management  to the  effect  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical  re -quirements regarding independence and notify it of all rela -tionships and other circumstances which can be reasonably considered to affect our independence and, where relevant, any applied security measures or action taken to eliminate threats.\n\nOn the basis of the conditions communicated to the senior Management, we determine which were the most significant conditions in the auditing of the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements for the relevant  period  of  time  and  which  are  therefore  key  audit -ing conditions. We describe these conditions in our auditor's statement except where legislation or other regulation pro -hibits the publishing of the matter or in the very rare instance where we determine that the matter should not be included in our auditor's statements because the negative consequenc -es of this can be reasonably expected to be of greater signif -icance than the public interest benefits of such a communi -cation.\n\n## Statement on the Management's review\n\nThe  Management  is  responsible  for  the  Management's  re -view.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements does not include the man -agement's review, and we do not express any kind of opinion on the Management's review.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  it  is our  responsibility  to  read  the  management's  review  and  in this connection consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial state -ments  or  the  parent  company  financial  statements  or  the knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way ap -pears to contain material misstatement.\n\nIt  is  furthermore  our  responsibility  to  consider  whether  the Management's review contains the information required pur -suant to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'.\n\nBased on the work performed, we believe that the manage -ment's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements  and has been prepared in accordance with the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supple -mentary Pension Fund (ATP)'. We have not found any material misstatement in the Management's review.\n\nHiller\u00f8d, 8 February 2023\n\n## Deloitte",
