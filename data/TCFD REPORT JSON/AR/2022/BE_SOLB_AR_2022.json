I\n\nIn one of the world's most hostile environments, Gilles and Nathan tackled 450km on skis, 600km in kayaks and opened up a new 1,000-meter vertical climbing route. Though extreme weather conditions and bureaucratic difficulties threatened to derail their plans, the duo persevered, completing all three stages of their expedition and collecting important scientific data to help us better understand the impact of climate change. As part of our Corporate Citizenship program supporting projects in\n\n## mission\n\neducation, innovation and sustainability, Solvay was one of the main sponsors of the expedition.\n\n'Our expedition had a scientific part and a human part,' explains Nathan. 'Scientific because we wanted the expedition to have a purpose related to the environment and climate change, and human because we wanted to give a message to people, to encourage people to believe in and follow their dreams.'\n\n'I like to think that in terms of science, awareness and values, explorers have a lot to contribute,' says Gilles. 'We can bring messages, such as courage, resilience and perseverance through difficult times. But we can also be the\n\nnatural ambassadors for field science, tailoring expeditions to the needs of scientists and giving them a much-needed voice.'\n\n## Solvay corporate citizenship in/uni00A0action\n\n- At Solvay, we have always been driven by our conviction that science holds the key to solving society's greatest challenges. We aim to support scientific research through partnerships and collaborations with universities, investing in extraordinary projects, such as the Nanok Expedition, that help us to reinvent progress.\n\n'Gilles and Nathan's passion for exploration, for forging new paths and advancing climate science, is so motivating for us all at Solvay - there's so much we\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith\n\ncan learn from them, both as a business and as people,' says Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri. 'The incredible success of their expedition is a great example of what you can achieve when you go after your passion, dream big and plan to win.'\n\nThe information collected during the Nanok Expedition is being used by four universities and research centers in Belgium and Denmark to study diverse topics relating to climate change, such as changes to the ice sheet and the melting of the ice cap, the impact of microplastics, and rock dust released by melting glaciers. -\n\nwww.nanokexpedition.be",

With record financial results, investments, strong cash generation and profitability, we have reached the highest point of a fast transformation that began in 2019, and has enabled us to drastically reduce our debt and positioned us in an ideal situation for entering into the next chapter of our Group's history.\n\nThese outstanding results are a testament to our collective sense of vision and adaptation to a volatile environment, as they were achieved at a time of high inflation, political tensions and general macroeconomic uncertainty. We have successfully navigated through these extraordinarily turbulent conditions by focusing on what we can control and doing so with discipline and efficiency in mind, while seizing every opportunity to create value. We are confident that we have entered 2023 as a stronger and more agile company than ever.\n\nT\n\nAllow me to stress that in this exceptional year, we have been creating value for ALL stakeholders, including:\n\n- f Our employees, through anti-inflation support;\n- f Our shareholders, as Solvay will recommend a dividend increase at our General Assembly which - if approved - would be our highest increase to date; and\n- f Future generations, whom we are serving with ground-breaking innovations that will contribute to a cleaner, safer future, such as the reinvention of the Solvay process to produce soda ash as well as the development of non-fluorosurfactant technologies for the manufacturing of fluorinated products that are essential for the decarbonization of the economy.\n\nIt is clear that Group results are aligned with the interests of all stakeholders, creating sustainable, shared value for all, which, in my view, represents a striking, unprecedented success on behalf  of the management team and all employees worldwide.\n\nLast year was also a productive one for the Board of Directors. The Board was closely involved in Solvay's strategic positioning on all\n\n## by Nicolas Bo\u00ebl\n\nmajor, forward-looking strategies. We also successfully integrated two new members, Laurence Debroux and Pierre Gurdjian, who contribute complementary competencies and fresh perspectives to our Board's work and bring the number of independent Directors to 10/uni00A0out of 15  Board members.\n\nAs part of our efforts to continue raising the bar, the Board last year entered into an in-depth evaluation of Directors under the guidance of Guberna, the non-profit reference organization for good governance in Belgium. We view this evaluation as an opportunity to keep progressing and building on the basis of our governance program rooted in the transparent and trusting spirit of collaboration that exists between the Board and the Executive Leadership Team.\n\nOn-site visits to Solvay's operations in Italy were a highlight of the Board's activities last year, as they are a testament to our Group's innovation and responsible manufacturing principles that we implement everywhere, including when managing the aftermath of an acquisition. Moreover, the Board's meetings with the local teams not only allowed Directors to express their gratitude, but also gave them a firsthand understanding of how the Group's culture and purpose come to life in the field.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my personal gratitude to the Solvay employees for their unremitting engagement; to the Group Chief Executive Officer, who sets the pace, raises the bar everyday and has delivered, with her team, unprecedented results; and to our shareholders, for their continued commitment to our Group and our purpose. I am looking forward to laying the foundations, together,  of our future success as two new, strong companies.  -\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Interview with\n\nPRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP/uni00A0TEAM AND CEO\n\n## What were the biggest highlights, looking back at Solvay's 2022 financial performance?\n\nIlham Kadri I was proud beyond words with the Group's unprecedented performance, thanks to the work of our teams deserves a celebration. The combination of strong pricing and volume increase in 2022 helped us deliver  26% growth in net sales, with every business contributing. This in turn drove EBITDA above the 3 billion euro mark for the first time in the company's 160-year history.\n\nWe achieved these record results while maintaining our disciplined approach on cash: Q4 marked our 15th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, of which we generated a record \u20ac1.1 billion for the year. At the same time we lifted our capital expenditure to \u20ac1 billion, well above pre-pandemic levels and almost \u20ac300 million above 2021. Last, and perhaps most importantly, our Group's balance sheet is considerably more robust today, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 1.1, which is half of where it stood in 2019.\n\nThese numbers illustrate our ability to look simultaneously into the microscope and into the telescope. They result from our strategy to differentiate our portfolio and shift toward higher value-added products to reshape our organization and, in the shorter term, our ability to pursue disciplined cost control as well as our pricing power in markets where we bring outstanding value to our customers.\n\nWe indeed created shared value for all:  for our customers, through innovation, the quality of our products and the reliability of our supply; and for our teams, with the successful launch of a worldwide employee shareholding plan, as well as anti-inflation bonuses and pay increases in line with market practice.\n\n## Ilham Kadri\n\n'Today, we have the perfect equation to be future-proof through the combination of/uni00A0a high-performing culture, talented people, compelling business results, a robust capital/uni00A0structure and ambitious projects.\"\n\n## How does the strong performance support the company's sustainable growth ambition?\n\nI.K. Our economic performance is precisely what enables us to innovate and invest in delivering on our Solvay One Planet ambition. Since the inception of this program four years ago, we have achieved a 15% structural reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which amounts to almost twice the reduction target set in the Paris Climate Agreement. We continue to drive momentum on this front, with biomass boilers under construction in three major plants in Europe and investment in methane abatement in the United States. These initiatives, among others, are placing us on the right trajectory to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn addition to delivering on Solvay One planet goals, we are laying the groundwork for product innovation through our four growth platforms: Renewable Materials and Biotechnology, Batteries, Green Hydrogen and Thermoplastic Composites, which are designed to meet our customers' growing demand for sustainable solutions and represent an estimated \u20ac10 billion growth opportunity for our Group. We are also innovating on processes, while our 'Star Factory' program, launched in 2021, is transforming our manufacturing sites into industry benchmarks in terms of competitiveness and sustainability. Last year, our two pilot sites had an immediate impact on our bottom line and we are now scaling up to include 40 additional sites worldwide in 2023.\n\n## Why is this the right time to split the Group?\n\nI.K. We are confident this separation will establish two strong industry leaders, with distinct operating models to optimize their",

Our 2022 results are a testament to our successful transformation, which we delivered three years ahead of schedule, while steering the company through a global pandemic, geopolitical crises and subsequent macroeconomic turmoil.\n\nToday, we are ready to enter the next phase in our history and redefine our growth potential. With our transformation complete, two types of business profiles have clearly emerged from our portfolio - essentials and specialties - and the planned split is designed to separate the businesses in a way that will unleash their full potential. Importantly, we have strengthened the foundations of our culture through our Purpose and Strategy so that it can continue to flourish at both companies once the separation is effective.\n\n## Will Solvay's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ambition live on in the future?\n\nI.K. Our DEI initiatives are core to our culture and our success, and I am confident that both new companies will be able to build on the momentum we've achieved as one. We made compelling progress on our Solvay One Dignity roadmap last year, namely through concrete action to address the pay gap between male and female employees; the creation of nine Employee Resource Groups; our engagement alongside highly inspiring para-athletes; and the participation of 100 sites in our 2022 Solvay Citizen Day.\n\nOur mindset and values are firmly anchored throughout our organization and are illustrated by the continued activity of the Solvay Solidarity Fund in 2022, which supported care for people in Ukraine, Turkey and Syria, among others.\n\n## What is the significance of Solvay's 160th anniversary?\n\nI.K. In this special anniversary year, we are beginning a new chapter that is inspired by our 160-year journey. We will pass on our values and knowledge to both companies.\n\nToday, we have the perfect equation to be future-proof through the combination of a high-performing culture, talented people, compelling business results, a robust capital structure and ambitious projects. This will enable us to create two formidable companies with attractive investment profiles and values, built on the foundation of our 160-year journey. -\n\n<!-- image -->",

It would be made up of two business segments:\n\n- f Materials: an industry leader in advanced materials that provides customers with new solutions to critical performance and environmental challenges. Supported by underlying megatrends, such as electrification, lightweighting, sustainable mobility and digitalization, these businesses have a strong track record of above-market growth. With a focus on innovation, a robust commercial engine and a unique understanding of its customer base, this segment would help customers disrupt industries such as transportation, electronics and healthcare. The separation would ensure that it benefits from increased investments in capacity, innovation and commercial capabilities, supporting above-market organic growth, superior returns and industry-leading margins.\n- f Consumer and Resources: consisting primarily of businesses within Solvay's current Solutions segment, Consumer and Resources would be a market leader in providing specialty ingredients focused on more natural and sustainable solutions, by anticipating rapidly evolving customer needs. Its proven, asset-light business model is supported by underlying megatrends such as eco-friendly ingredients and resource efficiency, making it well positioned to drive the consumer industry toward biobased, natural and circular solutions, leveraging its portfolio of innovative solutions and application expertise. It would also be positioned to drive above market growth at strong returns.\n\nFollowing the separation, SpecialtyCo would be able to extend its leading position in sustainability, with a clear path to achieving carbon neutrality before 2040.\n\n## Unleashing our full potential to unlock value\n\n-  By strengthening the link between each company's unique needs and strategic path forward, we believe we can unleash our full potential and unlock value for all stakeholders moving forward. The capital structure of each company would be tailored to best support its value creation objectives.\n\nSolvay's shareholders would retain their current shares of Solvay stock under the separation plan. The separation would take place by means of a partial demerger, whereby the specialty businesses, assets and liabilities held by Solvay SA  will be spun off to SpecialtyCo. At the time of the separation, Solvay shareholders would also receive shares in SpecialtyCo pro rata to their shareholding in Solvay SA. We expect the shares of SpecialtyCo to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris and plan to structure the separation in a manner that would be tax efficient for a significant majority of shareholders in key jurisdictions. The transaction is subject to general market conditions and customary closing conditions, including final approval by Solvay's Board of Directors, consent of certain financing providers and shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting. We plan to complete the separation by December 2023. The Board of Directors of Solvac, Solvay's long-standing reference shareholder, has confirmed its full support for this transaction, in March 2022.\n\n## 2023 opens a new chapter\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was so successful that by 1900, it was used to process 95% of the soda ash consumed worldwide. Even now, 160 years\n\nlater, Ernest Solvay's innovation remains the preferred way to produce soda ash, and Solvay continues to lead the way in the soda ash and derivatives market.\n\nErnest Solvay's technological breakthrough provided a more efficient and cleaner alternative to the Leblanc process it replaced,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand he continued to work hard at improving it to stay ahead of the competition. Building on this legacy, we are seeking to dethrone our founder's soda ash process with a new breakthrough that will help us reach our climate neutrality target and respond to increasing customer demand for soda ash.\n\n'We have always operated by imposing on our minds a duty of continuous progress.'\n\nERNEST SOLVAY, FOUNDER\n\n## A 160-year-old process\n\n- Ernest Solvay came up with his ammoniasoda process at the start of the second industrial revolution, when electricity was just being industrialized and new processes were expanding the applications of chemistry. Now 160 years old, the process has some drawbacks that we need to address.\n\nThe biggest issue is that soda ash production produces high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for a significant amount  of  Solvay's  total  emissions. Around two-thirds of the emissions in soda\n\nash production are associated with the requirement to generate steam, which we are tackling by transitioning our soda ash plants away from CO 2 -intensive energy sources like coal. But to reach carbon neutrality, we also need to find a way of addressing the remaining third.\n\nThis alone is sufficient incentive for change, but with increasingly strict legislation on greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, there is also economic pressure on us to find a more environmentally friendly solution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'As the new process we have developed is more competitive and sustainable, all 'synthetic' soda ash producers will have adopted it within the next two decades'\n\nPHILIPPE KEHREN,\n\nPRESIDENT,  SODA ASH & DERIVATIVES",

Among many other things, it can be found in the windows of our houses, the detergents we use to clean and even the rechargeable batteries that power our appliances. Life without soda ash is almost unimaginable and, as many of its applications are supported by environmental megatrends, demand continues to grow.\n\nAs the world's largest soda ash producer, we recognize the need to continue Ernest Solvay's legacy of constant innovation in this area. By finding a way to produce soda ash more cleanly and efficiently, we will reduce its impact on the environment so that we can continue to use it in environmentally beneficial applications. And to best serve our customers, we know we need a solution that will provide a secure and competitive supply to keep up with strong demand.\n\n## A revolutionary soda ash process for a more sustainable world\n\n- Over the past 30 years, Solvay has invested \u20ac40 million in developing proprietary technology first patented in 2014. This investment, and the work of our talented engineers and researchers, has enabled us\n\nw READ MORE PAGE 36\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto develop a new method for producing soda ash, which introduces three revolutionary improvements: 50% less CO 2 emissions; a 20% reduction in water and salt  usage and a 30% reduction in limestone consumption; as well as significantly less limestone residues.\n\nThe  new  technology  complements our energy transition plans, using an electrochemical process that could be powered by renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. As it is more efficient, the process will also reduce consumption of natural resources; reducing our energy needs and our dependence on fossil fuels would improve our competitiveness and our ability to keep up with customer demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'I am proud that Solvay is perpetuating our founder's legacy of innovation as we lead our industry toward a more sustainable future.'\n\nILHAM KADRI, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\n## A milestone in Solvay's strategy to reach carbon neutrality\n\n- The next step is to test this breakthrough technology through the launch of a pilot project at our Dombasle site in France. Assuming that the pilot is successful, we plan to roll out the new technology across our European soda ash plants.\n\nThis development is a real game-changer for our carbon neutrality strategy. While our energy transition plans will enable us to phase out coal and reduce emissions 30% by 2030, our soda ash team expects that the new process innovation now being tested in Dombasle would allow our soda ash business to target full carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nWith this breakthrough, Solvay is poised to revolutionize the soda ash industry once more, cementing our position as the leading force in soda ash and sodium bicarbonate, and the partner of choice for our customers. Guiding Solvay's 160-year-old legacy business into a carbon-neutral world is a challenging task, but we are confident that we now have the knowledge, tools and capabilities to do so, delivering a solution that ensures sustainable value for all, for generations to come.\n\nA new process enabling:\n\n-50%\n\nCo 2 emissions\n\n-20%\n\nWater and salt consumption\n\n-30%\n\nLimestone consumption",

Customer demand for more sustainable solutions and circular\n\nproducts with lower environmental footprints is also putting pressure on the industry to make radical changes.\n\nT\n\nAt Solvay, we recognize that chemistry is both part of the problem and the solution. We strongly believe that chemistry will help shape our future for the better, but we know that this requires us to make fundamental changes to the way our plants operate. This is why we launched our Star Factory program.\n\nStar Factory is about transforming the capabilities and operational efficiency of our plants to ensure they are best-in-class\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin all areas, including manufacturing and digital excellence, sustainability, safety and people. In doing so, we ensure that we are able to meet increasingly high customer expectations, transforming the way we operate for the better.\n\n## A radical transformation for all of our factories\n\n- Star Factory is our response to a fast-changing world in which factories must live up to the highest expectations and be prepared to confront unprecedented challenges. This comprehensive transformation program is aimed at completely reinventing all of our plants. This will help us to develop and attract the best talents, while building strong foundations for the two future companies that we will launch through our Power of 2 project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The Star Factory program illustrates our determination to accelerate the transformation of all our manufacturing sites into an industry benchmark in terms of sustainability and performance.'\n\nAUGUSTO DI DONFRANCESCO, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP/uni00A0TEAM, CHIEF/uni00A0TRANSFORMATION AND OPERATIONS OFFICER\n\nOur main focus is on getting sites to to make real progress on energy efficiency, energy transition and greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects to benefit business and the environment. The program also addresses all other aspects of our Solvay One Planet objectives on climate, resources and better life, building on operational excellence and digitalization to drive our plants to become Star Factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Success for our pilot sites\n\n- We kicked off this huge program at the end of 2021 with two pilot sites: Tavaux in France and Spinetta Marengo in Italy. Our objective was to create a transformation roadmap for each of these sites and assess whether it could create value, both financially and in Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) areas, before extending the program to other sites.\n\nBoth sites defined their vision for the\n\nfuture and developed a comprehensive roadmap focused on five key areas: safety; sustainability; employee engagement; competitiveness; and customer satisfaction. They also set objectives to reach by 2030, as a way to monitor their performance. The roadmap sets out actions to be taken in all main domains at each industrial site and shows the expected impact these actions will have on the site's key performance objectives, as well as the resources needed for implementation.\n\nThe pilot sites demonstrated the ability of the Star Factory program to accelerate value creation in several different areas. Even more importantly, it generated results as soon as the first year.

Solvay's/uni00A0Leadership Academy plays an important role here, ensuring our leaders are equipped with the right skills.'\n\n## YVES COURTEMANCHE,\n\nSITE MANAGER, SAINT FONS, FRANCE\n\nIncorporating both bottom-up and topdown approaches, and uniting all site stakeholders around clear goals, our sites worked hard to ensure engagement and buy-in from leadership teams, employees, local communities and business partners. As Emilia Buffa, Spinetta Marengo Star Factory Leader, says: 'There is an acceptance curve but, in the end, a greater commitment.'\n\nWith their leadership driving the program, each plant  is fully empowered to implement our sustainability targets, engage with local authorities and communities, and develop the critical capabilities needed both now and in the future. Among these critical capabilities is developing and attracting the talents that will help us reach our full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Star Factory is helping us to quickly improve leadership skills across the sites and reinforce sustainability and digital mindsets, ensuring that everyone feels inspired to play a key role in our transformation journey, both now and in the future'\n\nANNE LEFEBVRE, GROUP PEOPLE SOLUTIONS, PEOPLE/uni00A0AND/uni00A0CAPABILITIES LEADER\n\n## Creating long-term, sustainable value for all Solvay stakeholders\n\n- For example, several site initiatives are targeted at reinforcing connections with our local communities. In Saint Fons, France, the site is exploring external partnerships to diversify their sourcing and strengthen the talent pipeline locally, while also working with various organizations to attract more women to jobs in the chemical industry. Similarly, in Rosignano, Italy, the site is partnering with local women's organizations, and has committed to improve connections with the local educational ecosystem.\n\nOur sites are also making great strides in improving sustainability. At Tavaux, we are investing to significantly reduce freshwater intake and greenhouse gas emissions despite doubling production. And in Spinetta, we invested \u20ac40 million in improving the purification of discharged water and reducing liquid waste, with the objective of eliminating the majority of the site's non-recoverable waste.\n\nIn addition, we have already achieved tangible results in improving our digital capabilities. An ambitious IT infrastructure modernization project  and  a  new  industrial  data management architecture are accelerating the implementation of data-intensive industrial projects. At Spinetta, for example, we have\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#2\n\ndeployed SeeQ, a self-service analytics tool that has a direct impact in our monomer and Technoflon\u00ae  production, reducing variable costs and increasing production capacity respectively. A condition-based monitoring system for rotating equipment at Tavaux was built on the new data architecture. The system helps maintenance teams make more accurate decisions about performance optimization and upkeep needs before equipment failure occurs, with the goal of reducing losses caused by asset breakdown by 30%.\n\nOur clear Capex and resources plan for each site, combined with a tailored governance system for decision, validation and escalation, provides us with a strong execution and decision engine that we can now apply globally. The pilots also enabled us to create a standard for plant digitalization and a library of best practices to accelerate the identification of solutions at other plants.\n\nThree additional plants joined the program in 2022: our Baton Rouge site in the US, Saint Fons in France and Rosignano in Italy. Another 40 plants will join in 2023, with the rest set to join over the following two years.\n\nThis accelerated implementation will ensure that Star Factory serves as a building block for our Power of 2 project. As both future companies intend to continue with the Star Factory program following the split, we have adapted the methodology for each company's specific needs and are preparing to grant them the appropriate capabilities for successful implementation./uni00A0-\n\n- w READ MORE PAGE 36\n\n5\n\nplants joined the program in 2022\n\n40\n\nplants to join in 2023 and all remaining plants by 2025",

It aims to reinvent the way we produce chemicals by combining chemistry and biology to convert renewable feedstocks into valuable and sustainable solutions that will preserve natural resources and support the transition to a carbon-neutral future. Most importantly, it will foster circularity by promoting the use of renewable resources and exploring new ways to manage the end of life for our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Through our new growth platform, we aim to connect with our partners to reinvent progress as we have done throughout our 160-year history, playing a key role in the chemical industry's transition to the bioeconomy in a carbon neutral future.'\n\nILHAM KADRI, CEO\n\n## Enabling circularity\n\n- The new platform, which was launched in May 2022, brings together several Solvay businesses to help meet growing demand for sustainable and circular solutions and develop new business opportunities enabled by biotechnology. It covers the entire value stream, helping to embed circularity into all of our businesses by focusing holistically on three interdependent areas: the origin of materials; biotechnologies for transformation; and product end of life management.\n\nFirst, to address the origin of materials, we aim to significantly increase the share of renewable carbon in our product offering by using sustainable and renewable feedstocks to develop more environmentally friendly, natural and circular products. Renewable carbon encompasses all sources of carbon other than fossil fuels, such as biomass, captured CO 2 and recycling. Our solvents derived from plants are a good example of a product Solvay already markets in this area.\n\nSecond, by using more biotechnology, combined with the chemistries mastered by Solvay, we expect to unlock new business opportunities to expand our customer base. Biotechnologies are a set of disruptive technologies that use enzymes or living microbes to transform feedstocks, such as crude oil, CO 2 and crops, into valuable molecules. This growing industry will open up new opportunities for us to expand our portfolio, while developing more cost-effective and lower carbon footprint processes for our existing products. Our venture capital fund, Solvay Ventures, has already invested in DMC, an American biotech startup, and Sofinnova, a French venture capital fund specializing in biotech, which will enrich our portfolio of options for growth.\n\nLastly, the platform will address the end of life of products, helping to close the loop and foster circularity. For our durable and longlasting advanced polymers, recycling and reuse are the preferred ways to do this, but in cases where neither is possible, such as ingredients in consumer formulations, developing molecules that do no harm to people or the planet is our imperative. Our biodegradableby-design solutions are designed to leave no trace in the environment and enable our customers to future-proof their products in an evolving regulatory landscape, which, in Europe, is driven by the European Green Deal and the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability. An example is the readily or inherently biodegradable water-soluble polymers we are developing for our home and personal care or agrochemicals markets, with the first product launches expected in 2023.\n\n## Driven by open innovation\n\n- The platform aims to achieve these three goals by accelerating open innovation. This involves developing strategic partnerships with suppliers and customers from different parts of the value chain to increase our capacity to innovate and develop new solutions that benefit multiple markets.\n\nWe are not starting from scratch: Solvay is already a market leader in some bio-polymers like guar, bio-sourced solvents and natural vanillin, the latter of which is enabled by biotechnology. The new growth platform will help us build on this by investing in assets and capabilities that will enable us to expand in areas where we are already market leaders, and by developing strategic partnerships that will lead us to new market spaces, complementing our existing technologies and expertise.\n\nOur investment in Suanfarma's Cipan manufacturing site in Portugal, which specializes in fermentation, is a good example. This is the first step in a long-term strategic alliance that will allow us to build on our expertise as a leading producer of natural vanillin to develop other natural ingredients for the food, flavors and fragrance markets, and improve our biotechnology capabilities, paving the way for further growth in naturals. The collaboration between our Materials business and French startup Carbios on the enzymatic recycling of polymers is another example. This project would enable complex, multilayer plastic films to be recycled, facilitating circularity.",

The event's success demonstrates the progress we have made in embedding DEI, and the discussions surrounding it, into our company culture, while also showing our capacity to mobilize and engage our employees globally around a common purpose.\n\n## Citizen Day 2022: I am because we are\n\n- Citizen Day is an annual Solvay event aimed at creating bonds between employees and with local communities by rallying around a subject that impacts us all. The\n\nCitizen Day 2022\n\n14,700\n\nparticipations\n\n105\n\nsites worldwide\n\n320\n\nactivities\n\n\u20ac50,000\n\ndonated to local NGOs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfourth edition of our Citizen Day focused on DEI, with almost 9,000 employees across 105 sites globally taking action to create a more inclusive company and society.\n\nOur activities were inspired by a common theme: 'I am because we are.' Taken from the African philosophy of 'Ubuntu,' this proverb resonates with Solvay's Purpose, reminding us that our sense of self is shaped by our relationships with other people and that our common bonds are more important than our differences.\n\n'I was really impressed by the creativity of our sites globally, with each one appropriating the concept to make it relevant to their specific culture or environment. I can feel we are truly moving forward together, creating an excellent foundation for the two future companies to build on!'\n\nNATHALIE VAN YPERSELE, CHIEF DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION OFFICER\n\nCitizen Day activities took place at global, site, team and individual levels, and in both virtual and in-person formats, with many involving partners and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) We also encouraged employees to get involved with the local community and speak up against noninclusive behaviors. All these activities gave our employees the opportunity to learn, exchange, discover and dare to share their opinions, contributing to an inclusive, diverse and equitable workplace.\n\n## Solvay sites mobilize for DEI\n\n- Solvay strives to establish and maintain a diverse workforce, provide equal career opportunities and make all of  our employees feel included in everything we do. By giving diverse talents equal opportunities and encouraging them to bring their whole selves to work, we are able to benefit from a workforce that is confident in voicing their opinions, and comfortable with bringing their experiences and ideas to the table. The wide variety of Citizen Day activities organized by our employees at site level showcased this culture.\n\nIn Curitiba, Brazil, for example, employees were taught the phrase 'I am because we are' in Brazilian sign language. The site created a video of dozens of employees signing the phrase, raising awareness of how different forms of communication can increase inclusivity. Several employees at Solvay are hearing impaired, or have friends or family that are. Demonstrating that employees at Solvay are willing to learn and show their support meant a lot to many of them.\n\n'The 2022 Citizen Day showed the power of collectivity and the barriers we can overcome when we look past our biases and beliefs. We can do so much more together - after all, I am because we are!'\n\nBIANCA PIEDE,\n\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE MANAGER, CURITIBA, BRAZIL",

These included a talent show, a ceremony to recognize the site's veterans and facilitating mock interviews to help students applying to historically black colleges and universities, as well as a potluck lunch celebrating the site's multicultural diversity. The wide variety of activities gave Alpharetta employees multiple opportunities to build positive relationships with their colleagues, while also giving back to the local community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Diversity and inclusion is a way of life in Alpharetta - we celebrate our differences as well as what brings us together. DEI is about belonging and the attendance numbers for the activities we organize show that people want to belong.'\n\n## DONNA DRAKE,\n\nHEAD OF CORE LABS US, ALPHARETTA/uni00A0SITE MANAGER\n\n## Employee Resource Groups take center stage\n\n- Solvay's Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play a key role in promoting DEI at Solvay. These grassroots groups led and run by employees organized various global workshops for Citizen Day, covering topics such as LGBTQ+ allyship, the role of men in DEI and the experiences of women in the workplace. We also took the opportunity to launch a new ERG, ADAPT, focused on people with disabilities and their allies.\n\nADAPT is sponsored by Solvay's Chief People Officer (CPO), Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien, who shared his own personal experience with the nearly 400 employees worldwide who joined the launch event: 'My family\n\nhas firsthand experience of what it feels like to be different, and how painful it can sometimes be. But what our experience has taught me is just how important it is to be open about it in order to deal with the difference. Diversity is something we need to discuss again and again if we are to move forward as a society, and the best way to help others embrace it is by helping them to understand it.'\n\n## Solvay4Sport: supporting athletes that embody Solvay values\n\n- Helping people understand and embrace difference is exactly what our Solvay4Sport initiative aims to do. To kick off Citizen Day, Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri hosted an inspiring discussion  with  Solvay4Sport  athlete Kgothatso 'KG' Montjane, designed to show Solvay employees that opportunity, possibility and greatness are achievable when we collectively recognize, respect and celebrate our differences.\n\nSolvay4Sport is a partnership between Solvay and three athletes: Italian para-athletic sprinter Ambra Sabatini, American para-athletic long jumper Trenten Merrill and South African wheelchair tennis player KG. The partnership aims to support these three athletes in achieving their sporting goals, while also reinforcing Solvay's DEI program, by showing that it is unity and not uniformity - or all of our individual differences combined - that allows society to achieve exceptional results. Our Solvay4Sport athletes embody everything Solvay stands for - performance, dedication, perseverance and a desire to go beyond making them perfect role models for Solvay employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'When you have a positive attitude you actually develop the ability to bounce back or tackle every challenge that you come across. There is always a solution, there is always a possibility -that's what I believe'\n\nKGOTHATSO MONTJANE (KG) SOUTH AFRICAN WHEELCHAIR TENNIS PLAYER\n\n## \u20ac50,000 donated to local NGOs\n\n- To ensure our Citizen Day actions have a lasting impact on the communities Solvay serves, the Group committed to converting employee participation in Citizen Day activities into financial contributions to local charities and DEI organizations in 14 countries. This contribution amounted to \u20ac50,000.\n\nThe success of our yearly Citizen Day event, and this edition in particular, reflects the commitment of Solvay people to the Group's values. This shared culture will prove vital in driving performance moving forward, both for Solvay as it is now and for the two new companies that will be created through our Power of 2 project. -\n\nw READ MORE PAGE 51",

        "page_content": "## A unique Battery Materials platform addressing the key challenges of the industry\n\n- The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation driven by several factors, including a shift in consumer mobility preferences and increasing regulations. Many regions around the world have set ambitious goals for decarbonization and major players are investing massively in capacity and infrastructure to reach their targets. Demand for lithium-ion electric vehicle (EV) batteries is witnessing significant growth as a result.\n\nSolvay has been supplying solutions to the automotive industry for more than 30 years, forming strong partnerships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their Tier 1 suppliers. We enjoy a strong leadership position in the EV battery market, and are pioneers in exploring technologies for the battery of the future. We also provide solutions in other areas, including battery cases, packs and recycling. Our battery materials platform brings together all of our relevant technologies and expertise, enabling us to collaborate with our customers on finding solutions to their unmet needs.\n\n## \u20ac2.5bn\n\nEstimated sales by 2030\n\n## Uniquely positioned in the value chain\n\n- With our extensive and proprietary range of high-performance polymers and innovative compounds, we can meet our customers' critical needs: making safer, more powerful, longer-lasting and lower-cost batteries. We supply materials for the different components of battery\n\nSOLVAY 2022 ANNUAL INTEGRATED REPORT\n\ncells, cases and packs, and are also working on solutions to recycle them. Li-Ion battery cells, for example, have four main components: the cathode, the anode, the electrolyte and the separator. We have solutions for all four and our materials make them perform better.\n\nThe cathode plays a significant role in determining battery capacity. Solvay's polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is used as a binder for cathodes, where it improves energy density, and as a coating on the separator, where it helps improve safety. And while PVDF adds significant value and performance benefits to the battery, it only represents a minor portion of the total battery cost.\n\nOur materials surround the battery, in more ways than one, with our polymers and composites being used to make battery modules and packs lighter. Our thermoplastic composite technology, for example, is used for battery enclosures. It reduces the weight of the enclosure by 25% compared to aluminum and 40% compared to steel, and makes the battery safer, while allowing for all battery components to be easily integrated.\n\n## Increasing driving range with our Solef\u00ae PVDF for binders\n\nOur Solef\u00ae PVDF specialty polymers for binders are the most advanced in the world. Developed using Solvay's research and innovation expertise in fluorinated chemistry and polymerization technology, Solef PVDF allows us to create more energy-dense batteries that enable increased driving range. This product has been recognized as a sustainable and profitable solution by the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions and was an essential component of the Solar Impulse plane, the world's first solarpowered aircraft to circumnavigate the world.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n1\n\n## Our materials circle the battery\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Creating a circular economy in batteries\n\n- Thanks to our recycling activities, we are helping the battery industry close the circularity loop. We have partnered with Veolia in an effort to create a European consortium in which Solvay's role is to purify and extract lithium, cobalt and nickel from end-of-life batteries and production scraps. Our solutions enable us to recover 95% of highpurity metals, which can be used in new cathodes. We are currently in the demonstration plant engineering phase of this project. Integrating EV batteries into the circular economy will ensure access to critical raw materials and decrease recycling costs. It will also lower the CO 2 footprint of the battery-making process, as the carbon footprint associated with battery metal recycling is far lower than that of primary metal extraction or mining.\n\n## Our innovation addresses the key challenges of the battery industry\n\n- We have aligned our research and innovation priorities with the future needs of the battery industry. This involves developing new chemistries that will solve the most difficult challenges as we develop the next generations of batteries. Through our platform, we are using our unmatched portfolio of technologies and our strong relationships with our customers to develop unique solutions that solve their specific application and performance requirements.\n\nThird-generation batteries, for example, require higher performing salts and additives that can increase high-and-low temperature battery performance. In addition to the Li-salts and advanced solvents that we currently provide, we are developing LiFSI and other proprietary additives, which will meet this need.\n\nSOLVAY 2022 ANNUAL INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nAnother example is our Energain\u00ae solvent for electrolytes, which responds to the need for high-voltage resistant solvents, used in emerging cathode technologies, such as high manganese cathodes and very high nickel cathodes. These two cathode technologies make up the largest share of the market today. They are expected to grow in the coming years, and Solvay provides solutions for both. As a leader in suspension PVDF, which is the technology of choice for the higher-end battery segment, we are able to continuously innovate to solve our customers' performance requirements.\n\nFourth-generation batteries, known as solid state batteries, are expected later this decade and promise significant improvements in energy density and safety. Our Solgain\u2122 technology, a solid film with an encapsulated electrolyte, will allow the industry to achieve this. Solvay is the front-runner in Europe in the development of this new technology.\n\n## A state-of-the-art innovation pilot unit in Europe\n\n41\n\nIn 2022, we inaugurated a new pilot research unit at our plant in La Rochelle, France. This will enable us to scale up development of advanced inorganic materials for solid electrolytes to be used in the next generation of automotive batteries. Solid state batteries are expected to complement lithium-ion batteries in the coming years, offering increased safety, improved performance and a reduction in the total cost of ownership. The pilot unit will enable us to respond to customers' needs by delivering products on a semi-industrial scale, and we will also carry out process studies to help prepare for the upcoming industrialization phase. The French state has supported Solvay on this project, as part of plans to build a European value chain for EV batteries and boost battery innovation in Europe.

These features make TPCs perfect for use in a number of demanding applications and environments across several industries, including aerospace, advanced air mobility, automotive and energy transition.\n\n## \u20ac1bn\n\nAddressable market for Solvay by 2030\n\n## A TPC roadmap for long-term innovation and growth\n\n- Solvay is the only company in the world with a diversified portfolio of specialty polymers and composite processing technologies capable of meeting all application needs. Our TPC growth platform brings end-to-end innovation - from molecules to composites - under one roof. Our state-of-the-art application and product development centers in Brussels, Belgium, and Alpharetta, Georgia, in the US, allow us to collaborate with customers from concept to commercial application, providing support in early-stage design, prototyping and testing of parts. This drastically reduces the time to market of our materials.\n\nSolvay's thermoplastic composites are a critical enabler for lightweight and corrosion-free tubular structures in the energy transition space, and for high-volume rate production in aerospace, including the fast-growing advanced air mobility segment. In automotive and other industries, our TPCs bring flexibility, functional integration and recyclability.\n\nOur three world-class manufacturing facilities in the US, in Anaheim, California; Havre de Grace, Maryland; and Greenville, South Carolina, use several manufacturing technologies to produce state-of-the-art unidirectional composite tape from a wide range of high-performance polymers, targeting a broad array of industries and applications.\n\nPart of our success comes from our strategic collaborations with our partners and customers. Through our Joint Lab agreement with Leonardo, we are able to focus on developing composite materials and production processes critical for the future of the aerospace industry. Our partnership with 9T Labs helps bring additively manufactured carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) parts to mass production. These can replace metal as structural parts in the aerospace, medical, automation, and oil and gas industries. Solvay is also at the center of key technology developments, working with leading institutions such as the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) in the US, the ThermoPlastic composites Research Center (TPRC) in the Netherlands and Politecnico di Milano in Italy.\n\n## Enabling the future of flight at the Solvay-NIAR Manufacturing Innovation Center\n\nSolvay and Wichita State University's National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) opened a joint Manufacturing Innovation Center in 2022, dedicated to enabling the future of flight through advances in composite technologies. The innovation center will provide leading aviation companies in the US with access to 150,000 square feet of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliant development, testing and prototyping facilities, as well as the latest in advanced aviation material research.\n\nSolvay and NIAR engineers will work hand-in-hand with customers to test ideas and innovative structures in real time, and companies will be able to fabricate entire aircraft structures, such as wings and fuselages, at a fraction of the cost of making it themselves. Our partnership with NIAR marks an important milestone in our ambition to help key customers across the US advance developments in aerospace, defense, space and advanced air mobility, demonstrating how our advanced material innovation can help our customers reduce time and excess costs when testing new applications.\n\n## Responding to the urgent global need for Green Hydrogen\n\n- Growing recognition of the need to accelerate the energy transition, combined with the energy crisis in Europe, has led to a dramatic increase in global interest in developing a green hydrogen (H2) economy. Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the EU has introduced plans to maximize its production of green H2, and thus reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, by doubling its domestic green H2 production target to 10 million metric tons by 2030. This makes development in this area more urgent than ever.\n\nGreen hydrogen is needed to reach the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It can be used to decarbonize the existing hydrogen economy, as well as in new applications, such as clean mobility, and has a key role to play in the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty transportation, and emissions-intensive industries, like steel manufacturing. While conventional hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy only - and it is chemistry that holds the key to transforming it into the green energy solution of the future.\n\nGovernments and companies are mobilizing. More than 50 countries have now built or are about to issue their hydrogen economy roadmaps, committing to the investments necessary to achieve their objective of net-zero carbon emissions in 2050, which are estimated at around $500 billion by 2030.\n\n## \u20ac5bn\n\nAddressable market for Solvay",

To achieve this, we not only need the necessary political will and huge investments, we also need the right materials.\n\nSolvay is one of the few companies in the world capable of providing the highly advanced materials needed for the green hydrogen economy. Our green hydrogen growth platform provides the advanced materials needed for green H2 production, but also for usage and - in the future - for storage.\n\nWhat makes us unique is our ability to provide materials both across the green H2 value chain and to today's leading hydrogen technology platforms. This includes polymers, such as fluoro-ionomers, for use in membranes with high proton conductivity and superior mechanical properties, and low-weight, high-resistance polysulfones, which are essential in the production and utilization of hydrogen. These materials are at the very heart of green hydrogen technology - without them it is impossible to produce the components or systems needed for green H2. Our Aquivion\u00ae ionomer and our Udel\u00ae polysulfone (PSU), for example, are both used in the core of hydrogen systems, where the key reaction happens, to enable hydrogen production and conversion in fuel cells.\n\nIn addition, we are expanding our offering for green hydrogen applications. For example, we are developing advanced material solutions for auxiliary components in fuel cells and electrolyzers in the balance of stack, the layers that surround the core. Our solutions provide a lightweight alternative to the metal parts that are currently used in hydrogen systems; replacing metal is vital to meet weight expectations,\n\nand also to increase production rates, allowing for automation, scalability and speed, while also helping to tackle waste.\n\n## Committed to a faster transition to green hydrogen\n\n- With relevant products and solutions all along the green hydrogen value chain, our ambition is to be a leading material solutions provider for the green hydrogen economy. Our green hydrogen platform brings together all of our innovative material and chemical solutions and competencies, concentrating our resources and efforts in one place to better serve and advise customers across industries.\n\nWe have also significantly increased the resources dedicated to this emerging market, including in research and innovation.

As part of this process, we have launched projects at three of our European soda ash plants - Rheinberg in Germany, Dombasle in France, and Devnya in Bulgaria - and in our US soda ash plant in Green River, Wyoming.\n\nThese projects will cut the Group's overall global emissions by 9.5% by 2025.\n\n- f At our soda ash plant in Dombasle, France, we are partnering with Veolia to completely phase out the use of coal and fossil fuels for energy generation at the site. Planned for a start in 2024, the project involves replacing three coal-fired boilers with a cogeneration unit that will produce energy from non-recyclable local waste. This will ensure the plant's competitiveness and cut its emissions by 50%. We are also investing in the site to test an innovative and sustainable new soda ash production process that would allow us to cut CO 2 emissions by half.\n- f In February 2022, we announced a plan to invest in one of the existing boilers at our largest European soda ash plant, located in Devnya, Bulgaria, to increase its co-combustion rate. The boiler, which went into operation at the end of 2022, is powered by 30% biomass fuel, which reduces CO 2 emissions at the plant by 20%.\n- f In Rheinberg, Germany, a second biomass boiler is scheduled to be operational in 2025, phasing out the use of coal for energy production at the site and making it the world's first soda ash plant to be powered primarily by renewable energy.\n\n## 59 projects underway to accelerate energy transition, representing/uni00A03.5/uni00A0Mt/uni00A0of CO 2 per year -\n\nequivalent to taking 1.9/uni00A0million cars off the road\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In addition to these projects, we are also innovating and preparing to be the first in the world to transfer regenerative thermal oxidation to trona mining operations at our soda ash plant in Green River Wyoming, in the US. With this technology breakthrough, we expect to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions for the plant by 20%. Using trona is another way to produce soda ash. The Green River plant is also progressing on plans to phase out coal entirely from its energy mix.\n\n## Accelerating our shift to renewable electricity worldwide\n\n- Renewable electricity projects are now underway at our plants worldwide. Many new projects were launched over the course of 2022. These projects enable us to power our operations with renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels, thus lowering our carbon emissions.\n\n- f In the US, 34 of our plants are now fully supplied by green electricity, covering the needs of six GBUs, double the level of 2021.\n- f In China, 100% of our operations, covering nine plants, are now supplied with renewable electricity.\n- f We continue to make progress in each of the European countries in which we operate. For instance, two new projects were launched in 2022:\n- -  From 2023 onward, our Voikkaa peroxides site in Finland will operate on 100% wind-generated electricity. This is the result of a ten-year utility power purchasing agreement (PPA), signed with Statkraft, to help decarbonize the production of hydrogen peroxide at the site.\n- -In 2022, we announced that we are teaming up with Iberdrola on a new solar facility project that will provide green electricity for our Tavaux and Saint Fons plants in France. The facility will be one of the largest such installations in Europe, producing nearly 75 gigawatts of energy and therefore significantly reducing the energy footprint of our Specialty Polymers and Aroma businesses in France. The plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2025.\n\n## Setting our Scope 3 emissions target\n\n- In 2022, we announced our plan to reduce by 2030 our Scope/uni00A03 emissions by 24% as compared to 2018. In early 2023, SBTi approved our 2030 climate targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. In the process, our target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions was slightly adjusted, from a 30% reduction to 31%.\n\nScope 3 includes greenhouse gas emissions occurring in the value chain that are associated with our activities, namely those occurring at suppliers' and customers' sites, when the consumer uses the product or at the end of a product's life. We are one of the few companies in the global chemical sector to have set such a target. In 2022, we reached 18% in structural reductions since 2018 through reduced sales of essential products with significant downstream impact, up from 14% structural in 2021. An additional 6% reduction comes from variations in sales mix and activity level since 2018, up from 3% in 2021, and is not secured for future years.\n\nAccelerating mobilization of our supply chain and reducing the upstream Scope 3 impact of raw materials is our leading Scope 3 priority, to consolidate achieving our goal and to improve our offering of low carbon-footprint products to our customers. We are also mobilizing our suppliers. In 2022, we started to engage with suppliers on high-impact raw materials. In addition, climate performance and commitments will form the basis for future relationships with strategic suppliers.\n\nOur Scope 3 strategy includes switching to bio-based and recycledbased raw materials. Through our new Renewable Materials and Biotechnology growth platform, we are also developing partnerships with our customers to ecodesign new products, processes and business models that will reduce emissions from cradle to end of life. There are clear synergies here with our efforts to develop circular solutions, which also focus on increasing the use of renewable carbon feedstock in our product offering. Examples include renewable\n\n## Two major initiatives to move us closer to carbon neutrality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStar Factory program\n\nOur Star Factory program , the goal of which is to reshape our plants and manufacturing processes,which is expected to contribute  to significant reductions in CO 2 emissions. At/uni00A0our pilot site in Tavaux, for example, we have developed a roadmap to achieve an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030.\n\nOur new soda ash production process is currently being piloted at our Dombasle site in France. This new innovation will enable us to reduce CO 2 emissions from soda ash production by 50%, while reducing resource consumption and eliminating limestone residues.\n\nw READ STORY PAGE 20\n\nw READ STORY PAGE 18\n\nNew soda ash production process",

Read more on page 43.\n\n## A leader in assessing emissions across the value chain\n\nSolvay is partnering with industry leaders in several breakthrough alliances to develop the next generation of product carbon footprint (PCF) assessments and accelerate transparency in the value chain with customers and suppliers. Examples include initiatives launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Partnership for Carbon Transparency (WBCSD PACT) and Together for Sustainability (TfS). Solvay is already a leader in the assessment of greenhouse gas impact across the value chain, using robust tools, such as our Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) tool and Life Cycle Analysis. -\n\n## Providing solutions that reduce our customers' overall climate impact\n\n- Another way in which we achieve climate benefits is through Solvay's sustainable solutions, which accelerate the shift to renewable energies or increased energy efficiency, such as lightweighting in mobility. \u20ac2.5 billion of the Group's sales come from solutions that reduce our customers' overall climate impact. The associated reduction in emissions is not accounted for in the Scope 3 emissions of Solvay and other chemical companies under the GHG reporting framework. We strive to bring new climate solutions to the market and support the transition to a net-zero world by building up the necessary value chains.\n\nFor example, we are partnering with Inaventa Solar, an innovator in solar thermal collector technology, to help them develop a new solar collector that uses our Ryton\u00ae PPS instead of metal. Ryton\u00ae PPS offers significant advantages as a replacement for metal, including greater design flexibility and automated manufacturing. Crucially, it enables weight reduction and more efficient large-volume production, ensuring a lower carbon footprint along the value chain.\n\nAnother partnership that contributes to lowering emissions is our joint venture with Orbia. Facilitating the production of suspensiongrade polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) - vital to the development of electric vehicle batteries - the partnership will fill a significant supply gap in North America. It will provide a local solution for the North American automotive industry capable of optimizing energy storage efficiency by increasing battery energy density, safety and power.\n\n## Reducing our impact on biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns stated in the COP15 Global Biodiversity Framework, preserving the world's ecosystems is essential for human, animal and plant health and, with 50% of the global economy estimated to be reliant on nature, it's vital for the economy too.\n\nSince 2020, Solvay has been a pioneer in biodiversity, combining a global and local approach with the aim of reducing pressure and damage, and progressively restoring biodiversity around our sites.\n\nA\n\n## A 28% reduction in our global pressure on biodiversity in 2022 brings Solvay close to achieving our 2030 target\n\n- As part of our Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition, we have committed to reducing by 2030 our pressure on biodiversity by 30% compared to 2018, and after just four years we are now close to achieving this target. Our efforts to decrease our impact on biodiversity focus on four drivers, which represent more than 90% of our impact: greenhouse gas emissions (50%); marine ecotoxicity (17%); freshwater eutrophication (15%); and soil acidification (12%).\n\nWe calculate the Group's pressure on biodiversity across the value chain, from cradle-to-gate, for our entire portfolio of products. This is a global approach, based on a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology known as the ReCiPe method. This method translates emissions and resource extraction into an environmental impact score.\n\n## Significant progress in assessing our impact on local biodiversity\n\n- All of Solvay's sites have been assessed on their sensitivity toward biodiversity using two international reference tools: the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Water Risk Filter. These tools identify protected species and areas around a specific location, as well as 'Key Biodiversity Areas,' which play a significant role in biodiversity conservation and sensitive ecosystems. Of our 185 sites, 48 are within five kilometers of one of these areas.",

        "page_content": "On the basis of this evaluation, we have prioritized 30 manufacturing sites, for which we are developing and implementing biodiversity roadmaps. All our roadmaps aim to:\n\n- f develop a vision for better integrating the site into its local environment and communities;\n- f identify and implement projects on the sites and in the surrounding area to protect biodiversity and support regeneration;\n- f develop 'nature-based solutions' that will bring economic, environmental and social benefits.\n\nSeveral sites have already started implementing their roadmaps, including Rosignano in Italy, Paulinia in Brazil and Oldbury in the UK. The development of our biodiversity roadmaps is integrated into our Star Factory program.\n\n## Promoting biodiversity at our Oldbury site\n\nAt our Oldbury site, more than 50 four-meter-tall trees have been planted along the site's main avenue, creating a nature corridor and providing shade for employees. In fall 2022, they added to this by planting 300 spring bulbs. These two initiatives were part of a site-wide sitewide effort organized by the Site Biodiversity Group. They also carried out tree-thinning activities in a small wooded area on the site in early 2022, and installed bird boxes and houses for bugs and hedgehogs alongside wildlife cameras to monitor the visitors. Foxes, squirrels, many birds - some of which have nested in the bird boxes - and at least one sparrowhawk have been spotted.\n\n## Establishing nature-based solutions\n\n- In the 1960s, our soda ash plant in Rosignano, Italy built a lake to supply the site with water. The lake has since become a natural reserve and is certified as a Natura 2000 protected area.\n\nIn addition to supplying the Rosignano site with water, the reserve is now used for educational and scientific projects, including a project run by the Italian League for Bird Protection (LIPU) to monitor the species that visit. The reserve is also closely connected with the local Santa Luce community, which organizes tourist visits there and recognizes the importance of the reserve for economic, environmental and social activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\"The Lake of Santa Luce has become the symbol of an area where the work of man has been skillfully integrated into a landscape of rare beauty. The lake, which is part of many hikers' itineraries, brings added value to the municipality, while providing important infrastructure for Solvay's Rosignano site.\"\n\n## GIAMILA CARLI,\n\nSANTA LUCE MAYOR, ITALY\n\nIn December 2022, the IUCN selected this case study for publication as a 'Nature-based Solution' - a project that provides environmental, economic and social benefits. The project, as well as Solvay's strategy on biodiversity, was presented during a workshop organized by the IUCN as part of the United Nations' COP15 Biodiversity Summit.\n\n'I have always been convinced that the challenge for chemistry is to gain more and more awareness about its role in researching naturebased solutions, to manage both natural and modified ecosystems in a sustainable way, for the benefit of biodiversity, human wellbeing and quality of life,' says Nicolas Dugenetay, Rosignano Site Manager.\n\n## Solvay signs COP15 biodiversity pledge\n\nThe COP15 on Biodiversity, which was chaired by China and organized in Montreal, Canada, ended with the adoption of the Global Biodiversity Framework, an ambitious program of targets and recommendations relating to biodiversity conservation and restoration. The private sector was invited to participate in negotiations and Solvay played an active part in the discussion. The resulting 'Make it mandatory' pledge, which Solvay signed, requires businesses to measure and report their impact and dependency on nature.\n\n'We were really pleased to hear about successful conservation and restoration efforts from Solvay and others that go beyond regulatory requirements. We are hopeful that the company will show leadership in conserving nature in the coming years.''\n\nSTEVE EDWARDS,\n\nIUCN SENIOR PROGRAM MANAGER.",

It will help us meet the growing demand for circular and sustainable solutions by increasing the share of renewable carbon in Solvay's product offering and developing new business opportunities enabled by biotechnology or biodegradable solutions. More than 200\n\n1. Our new KPI is defined according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circulytics framework. It comprises products either: based on recycled or renewable materials, produced with renewable energy, with increasing longevity in the use phase or enabling recycling at the end of life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nresearchers work on these topics at Solvay in Brazil, the US, Europe and India, focusing on accelerating the integration of sustainable renewable feedstocks into our products, using biotechnologies to transform these raw materials into products and developing new approaches to manage their end of life.\n\nOur technologies are essential for enabling the circular economy in many fields, but reinventing progress in this area requires collaboration with partners. We aim to do this through our role in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, through the growth platform, and through multiple partnerships, such as those we have with Mitsubishi Chemicals Advanced Materials relating to polysulfone (PSU), with Carbios for PVDC and other bio projects, and with Veolia for batteries.\n\n## Developing solutions that reduce global resource consumption\n\n## Renewable products to make home and beauty care circular\n\n- In 2022, we added two new high-performance biosurfactants to our Mirasoft\u00ae range.

They can be utilized  in a wide range of beauty care applications.\n\nWe are also now able to produce a bio-circular intermediate, Fentamine\u00ae DMAPA UP for use in  surfactants, helping our customers reduce the environmental footprint of their home and beauty care formulations and cater to consumer needs. It is produced at our site in Zhangjiagang, China, using the mass balance (MB) method * ,  which allows us to track and trace renewable and circular content across the value chain. The site recently received the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) PLUS designation, an internationally recognized standard for bio-based and recycled-based materials.\n\n## Recycled-based products for more sustainable specialty polymers\n\n- We have developed a number of high-performance products with a reduced carbon footprint as part of our efforts to transition our specialty polymers portfolio to the circular economy.  Our ReCycle MB Specialty Polymers are used for applications ranging from automotive and household appliances to electronics, and use the mass balance method to ensure responsible sourcing.\n\nWith our Augusta, Georgia site in the US now ISCC-PLUS certified, we will be able to manufacture a recycled-based sulfone monomer for our Udel\u00ae PSU ReCycle MB and Radel\u00ae PPSU ReCycle MB, which are used in hemodialysis membranes and other applications.\n\nThe certification process will cover a growing portfolio of products. Additional certified high-performance materials will soon become available globally, starting with Ryton\u00ae PPS ReCycle MB and Amodel\u00ae PPA ReCycle MB, both of which are used in the automotive and electronics industries.\n\n*The Mass Balance (MB) approach tracks the sustainability of a product through the whole value chain, driving the industry toward adopting critical environmental best practices.\n\n## Partnering to accelerate the circular economy\n\n## Using biotechnology to create a more circular plastics economy with Carbios\n\n- Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) is used to coat flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films. These films are used in applications like food packaging because of their impressive barrier properties, but their multilayer structures make them difficult to recycle. Providing a feasible and sustainable end-of-life management solution for PVDCcoated PET films will help the industry 'close the loop,' while also opening up new possibilities for our high-barrier specialty polymers in other markets, such as the packaging of pharmaceutical products. To address this, we partnered with biochemical company Carbios, which has developed a unique enzymatic biological recycling technology. Through a joint study, we were able to demonstrate that this technology is capable of fully recycling multilayer PET films coated with Solvay's Diofan\u00ae PVDC2 high-barrier polymer.\n\n## Creating an open loop business model for single-use surgical instruments with Ostium\n\n- Our customers in the healthcare industry must meet strict regulatory demands, while minimizing the carbon footprint of their products and reducing waste. To help them, we teamed up with French start-up Ostium to enable the mechanical recycling of single-use surgical instruments molded in glass-fiber reinforced Ixef\u00ae polyarylamide (PARA) from our specialty polymers portfolio.\n\nThis collaboration, which is still in the development and evaluation stage, is the first such initiative aimed at recycling and upcycling valuable polymers from used healthcare devices and would make single-use surgical instruments a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to metal. The recycled product could be used in high-end markets such as automotive, and sports and leisure equipment, thus integrating endof-life surgical instruments into an open loop circular ecosystem.\n\nWe have proven it is possible to recycle and upcycle the polymer material and are now developing a way to ensure consistently high recycling standards, which involves controlling every step in the loop from the original Ixef\u00ae PARA to the upcycled PARA compound. Our intention is to use what we learn from this experience to help us develop ways of recycling other medical device applications in the future.",

It also helps us to create value; by improving the sustainability of our sites and processes, we improve the sustainability of our products, allowing us to better cater to the needs and expectations of our customers.\n\n## Outstanding achievements in industrial waste reduction\n\n- - Non-sustainable industrial waste (NSIW) is waste that is landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. One of our Solvay One Planet objectives is to reduce this waste by 30% by 2030, compared to 2018. This means finding ways to revalorize it, either by reducing it at the source, reusing it in the same process, recycling it in another process or recovering energy from it.\n\nWe reached our 2030 Solvay One Planet target in 2021 and consolidated that result by achieving a 36% reduction in 2022, compared to the 2018 baseline, more than compensating for the additional waste generated by growth. More than 53 projects have been deployed to address non-\n\nsustainable industrial waste and this will continue to grow through the Star Factory program.\n\n## Four major projects to reduce industrial waste at our sites\n\n- f Panoli, India: The calcium fluoride (CaF2)-rich sludge produced at the site is now being reused as an additive in a cement plant instead of going to landfill. CaF2 helps to reduce the temperature of the kiln, minimizing energy consumption and CO 2 emissions while ensuring continued production of high-quality cement.  The experience at Panoli has helped us to develop our knowledge of valorization opportunities like this one and improved our ability to develop similar solutions at other sites.\n- f Piedmont, South Carolina, US: To help achieve their target of zero waste to landfill, the site is segregating and sorting waste based on what can be valorized, recycled or used in waste-to-energy programs. Since it started in July 2022, the program has contributed to reducing the annual volume of the site's waste disposed in landfill by 15% compared to 2021. The site is passing on their lessons learned to other Solvay locations.\n- f Collonges, France: Rather than disposing of any silica that doesn't meet the required specifications for sale in landfill, we are using this discarded silica to create a range of products sold for other uses.\n\n## More than 60 projects addressing more than 60,000 tons per year of non-sustainable industrial waste Our most advanced reduction projects\n\n- Operational projects\n- Ongoing feasibility study\n- Hazardous waste diverted from landfi ll\n\nReduce\n\nReuse\n\nRecycle\n\nWaste to cement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste to energy",

In 2022, the site reduced the volume of the main waste polymer stream by 76% compared to 2021.\n\n## Reducing our freshwater intake\n\n- Record high temperatures and long periods without rainfall around the world, and especially in Europe, over the summer of 2022 underlined the importance of addressing water scarcity. Our Star Factory program, which is currently being rolled out globally across all of our sites, aims to define a clear roadmap for each plant, with targeted actions to reduce our freshwater intake that will be pursued long term. Water is essential to our operations and shortages can have a significant impact, even leading to production losses. With projects underway at more than 20 sites across all geographic zones, we are on track to meet our 2030 target to reduce our freshwater intake by 25% compared to 2018.\n\nIn 2022, we experienced two droughts and two cases of severe freezing with an impact on water intake. To address water scarcity at our sites, we have launched various water management initiatives. These include putting in place a dashboard that monitors around 90% of the Group's daily freshwater intake.\n\nIn 2022, we began significant work to improve the resilience of our sites in relation to water risks. We conducted a review of water risks, which assessed about half of our sites according to several criteria includingwater scarcity, quality of effluents and risks related to regulations, and led to longer-term initiatives. At our site in Paulinia, Brazil, for example, we are working to avoid future water shortages by holding regular roundtables with authorities and local stakeholders to better manage the water basin. Three projects have been approved so far that will reduce water intake by 5.6Mm\u00b3 per year. Seven sites have designed roadmaps to improve their resilience, with the potential to achieve 30 million cubic meters in water intake reduction.\n\n## Two examples of how we are reducing freshwater intake at our sites\n\n- f Tavaux, France: To minimize the consumption of surface water and control well water intake, the site has been working to optimize the functioning of its water tower, which is used for cooling in chemical processes. Through this and other initiatives introduced as part of the Star Factory program, the site will be able to double its production output in line with our target to reduce freshwater intake.\n- f Willow Island, West Virginia, US: The site has introduced a number of measures to reduce freshwater intake. This includes improving automation of chemical and cooling water processes, reducing water tower overflow, using recycled water in two processes and installing automated building hose stations. The improvements are expected to reduce water consumption by about  260,000m 3 per year.\n\n## Projects to reduce freshwater intake underway at more than 20 sites across/uni00A0the/uni00A0world On track to reach our -25% target by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->",

These products are made from three natural materials - limestone, salt brine and water - and are used in essential applications, such as the production of glass and air-pollution control systems, and in healthcare applications, where it has a role to play in hemodialysis treatmen. At the\n\nend of the soda ash production process in Rosignano, the remaining inert, natural materials are conveyed to the sea. These consist of powdery limestone mixed with gypsum, sand and clay - none of which are toxic or dangerous, though it is fully acknowledged that these residues have a significant visual impact on that part of the coast.\n\nS\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have invested more than \u20ac400 million in improving sustainability at Rosignano, helping decrease freshwater consumption, lower energy use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase recycling at the plant. In 2022, we announced a new investment, as well as projects to ensure continued optimization of operational efficiency and sustainability in Rosignano.\n\n## Reducing limestone residues\n\n- In September 2022, in line with the conditions of our operating permit, which was renewed in January 2022, we announced an estimated \u20ac15 million investment in new technical and process solutions at the site to reduce limestone residues remaining from the production cycle. Our objective is to lower the maximum volume of residues released to the sea currently specified in the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) permit by 20% by 2030, and by 40% by 2040, through targeted improvements at different steps of the production process, as well as an optimization of the limestone granulometry and quality.\n\nThis commitment brought an end to Bluebell Capital Partners' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) campaign against Solvay.\n\n## Partnering to create a circular economy\n\n- In addition to this investment, we announced that we are partnering with two companies to collect and reuse the limestone residues produced in Rosignano. Pending further tests, these new partnerships could accelerate efforts to reduce the amount of limestone residue released into the sea, repurposing it for use in construction and agriculture, and therefore contributing to the creation of a circular economy for our soda ash production in Rosignano.\n\nTogether with IPSIIS, a startup established in Wallonia, Belgium, which specializes in the manufacture of environmentally friendly, nonflammable, lightweight and geo-sourced insulating mineral foams, we are testing how soda ash manufacturing residues can be used to produce specialized construction products. IPSIIS has been labeled a Solar Impulse Efficient Solution since 2018.\n\nWe are also working with the Italian subsidiary of German company Ferro Duo, which specializes in recycling industrial materials, using the inert solids produced during soda ash manufacturing in fertilizers to enrich soils in which precious elements like calcium, sulfur, potassium, magnesium and iron are found.\n\n## Reinventing the soda ash process to reduce our footprint\n\n- In addition, Solvay is taking another important step toward achieving our 2050 carbon neutrality objective by completely reinventing our soda ash process, targeting zero limestone discharge globally by 2050. This new process, which is the result of nearly 30 years of fundamental research, would lead to three revolutionary improvements in the process: 50% less CO 2 emissions; a reduction in water, brine and limestone consumption; and the elimination of limestone residues. It would allow our plants to operate more efficiently and sustainably, while enhancing their competitiveness. The development is progressing as planned and on schedule. The pilot plant in Dombasle, France, which was announced in September 2022, is expected to start by the end of the first quarter of 2023.",

This includes learning how to protect our mental health and improve our resilience.\n\nAs part of our Better Life at Work program, we launched a broad range of well-being webinars and workshops for employees across the world. One of these is Resilience in Times of Change, a series of workshops developed to help our employees understand change and better adapt to it.\n\nWe also offer an Employee Assistance Program, which includes free psychological support, well-being advice, life coaching and mindfulness for all employees and members of their households. In addition, our Speak Up service enables colleagues to safely report or seek assistance if they witness any inappropriate or unethical behavior.\n\n## 1,150\n\nemployees trained in well-being webinars and workshops provided in/uni00A0 10 /uni00A0languages; 83% found it useful\n\nAs a global company, we must adapt our approach to well-being to suit different regional needs. In China, for example, we are introducing our well-being initiatives gradually and have observed real and impactful change as a result. In the US, our approach has helped to structure, organize and coordinate dialogue.\n\n## Providing social support\n\n-  Our social initiatives are aimed at providing our employees with the support they need to perform at their best and face life's challenges, including hardship. In addition, they ensure that our impact on our local communities is a positive one, enabling us to develop strong and mutually beneficial relationships.\n\n## Special benefits for all through Solvay Cares\n\n-  Through our Solvay Cares social program, we ensure that all Solvay employees globally are guaranteed minimum social benefits. These benefits include 16 weeks of parental leave for all parents, health insurance, and disability and life insurance. In 2022, we made our parental leave policy even more flexible by allowing parents to choose whether to take their 16-week leave all at once or over several periods of time.\n\n## Families of >200 babies\n\nhave benefited from Solvay's universal 16-week parental leave\n\n## We talk to...

We are a pioneer in hybrid working, for example, and several employees in China have benefitted from the support of the Solvay Solidarity Fund, which has made everyone feel that they can grow with us and count on us to provide them with the support they need in tough times.\n\nOne of the initiatives we are most proud of is Union Cares, which enables high quality social dialogue. Employees are especially grateful for the care provided by the union during the pandemic, which included food supplies and health assistance. Solvay China even won the national award for harmonized labor relations in 2022.\n\nSolvay China is also notable for its inclusive working environment, where employees are able to speak openly and share different views through channels such as the One Pulse survey. Hiring managers are increasingly eager to offer opportunities to female candidates and we have undertaken pay equity exercises with managers, which has been highly appreciated by employees.\n\n## What are we doing to attract and retain talent in China?\n\nC.W. At Solvay, everyone is given the opportunity to develop to their full potential. We believe in empowering our young talents, so that they feel valued and dare to explore the unknown. In 2022, we partnered with two top universities - Fudan University and East China University of Science and Technology - to set up a Solvay China scholarship for full-time students in chemical engineering-related subjects. The move aims to attract top talents and outstanding graduates to join Solvay China and energize our talent pool.",

Since 2020, the Fund has donated more than \u20ac9 million to individual and collective causes. In 2022, we supported more than 50 projects in 14 countries, funding post-pandemic research, helping employees and charity partners navigate uncertainty, and aiding reconstruction efforts after flooding in 2021. A major focus was on supporting those affected by the war in Ukraine, donating around \u20ac1.5 million to various initiatives organized at global and site levels. In recognition of our efforts, Solvay was named one of the winners of the 2022 European Chemistry Industry Council (Cefic) European Responsible Care Awards in the category of Humanitarian Aid.\n\n## Three important financial initiatives in/uni00A02022\n\n-  In line with our vision to create sustainable shared value for all, and reflecting our human-centered Care and Dare approach to leadership, we introduced three key financial initiatives for employees in 2022, as well as increasing our Global Performance Sharing Plan budget.\n\n## Helping employees cope with high inflation\n\n-  Solvay was one of the first companies to provide support for employees significantly impacted by inflation. In July 2022, we announced that \u20ac9.5 million would be distributed among the Solvay employees proportionally most affected, who are located in highinflation countries that are not protected by national schemes.\n\n## Advancing on our pay equity journey\n\n-  We have now set out concrete actions to move forward with our pay equity journey, ensuring that we do this in a gender-neutral way. We conduct off-cycle reviews throughout the year to close gaps that are the result of regular business decisions such as promotions, transfers or new hires, looking both outward, using comparative ratios as an external benchmark, and inward, using an internal equity check. As of 2021, our Annual Integrated Report provides full clarity on salary ratios for managerial positions in the Group.\n\n## Sharing growth through our employee share plan\n\n- We launched our first employee share plan in 2022, achieving an impressive participation rate of 27.73%, which is ahead of the benchmark for similar initiatives. The plan was open to all employees in the 22 countries in which local regulations permitted us to offer it. The initiative aims to enhance belonging, improve employee commitment and ensure that our employees are better able to share in our growth and performance.\n\n## ~28%\n\nof employees are Solvay shareholders\n\n'The fact that so many employees from all around the world have elected to invest personal funds in becoming shareholders in Solvay is a source of pride and a strong signal that an 'owner mindset' is taking hold in Solvay.'\n\n## KARIM HAJJAR,\n\nMEMBER OF EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\n## Rewarding everyone's contributions to Group performance\n\n-  In 2022, we increased our Global Performance Sharing (GPS) budgets to \u20ac15 million, up from \u20ac11 million in 2021, with outcomes largely determined by financial and sustainable performance.

We put DEI on the agenda of leadership meetings and made it the focus of our annual Citizen Day event. And we are now starting to see results, especially in the area of\n\nnon-inclusive behaviors, which was our first priority. Our 2022 Pulse inclusion survey showed an 18% decrease in reports of non-inclusive behaviors, in comparison to the results of our 2021 survey, and a similar increase in the number of people reporting that they would speak up if they witnessed these behaviors.\n\nH\n\nWe believe that equity and inclusion are the building blocks for diversity: being an inclusive company will enable us to keep and attract the diverse talents we need to ensure continued success. 'At Solvay, we often use the expression 'bring your whole self to work,' meaning that we value our employees no matter who they are, both for their visible diversity as well as their diversity of thoughts, experiences and backgrounds,' explains Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien, Chief People Officer (CPO). 'We want to help our employees feel empowered about having diverse backgrounds, which will allow them to feel more comfortable in speaking up and putting forward their opinions.'\n\nOur Care and Dare culture encourages leaders to include their teams in projects, reflections or decisions. These experiences help our employees grow and contribute to providing them with the skills needed to ensure more equal career opportunities. This is reflected in our Solvay One Dignity DEI program, which sets out nine objectives with associated action plans to be achieved by 2025.\n\n## Solvay One Dignity program: main achievements/uni00A0in 2022\n\n- f DEI policy updated and promoted\n- f Quarterly measurement of the diversity of our teams in terms of  gender, age and nationality, using our new Homogeneity Index\n- f Publication of first gender pay gap report and launch of first Group-wide pay equity correction exercise\n- f Design of an 'Inclusive Leadership workshop' and certification of 38 internal facilitators\n- f 300 participants in the A Effect program for women leaders in 2022\n- f First virtual Employee Resource Group (ERG) convention in June with 300 participants\n- f Nine active ERGs, after the launch of the Disability Inclusion and Voice of Asia ERGs in 2022\n- f Partnership agreements signed with two organizations: Out and Equal and Disability:IN\n- f Second Solvay-wide inclusion survey also addressed wellbeing questions\n\n## Inclusive leadership and mindset\n\n-  In 2022, we focused on initiatives aimed at fostering a long-term change in culture and mindset that will carry over into the two future companies we plan to create.\n\n- f We created a new Senior Leadership Community (SLC), designed to ensure that senior management reflects diverse cultures, skills, ages and experiences. The SLC is made up of 50 leaders and nearly half of them are women.\n- f We set up inclusive leadership workshops, with a plan to reach 500 leaders by mid 2023, and we developed training and mentoring programs to help embed DEI into our culture. Since 2021, 450 Solvay women, which represents 20% of our female junior manager population, have taken part in the 100-day A Effect program, designed to help women boost their careers by focusing on three key pillars: confidence; risk-taking; and influence. We have also recruited more than 50 Solvay executives to act as mentors.\n- f We supported the launch and expansion of a number of new Employee Resource Groups and established partnerships with external DEI organizations.\n- f We made Solvay a more inclusive working environment for people with disabilities. This involved participating in the Disability:IN Global Index to determine what steps we needed to take. We also launched a global ERG, known as ADAPT, to provide resources and support for employees with disabilities and care-givers, which is sponsored by our Chief People Officer, Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien. In addition, we focused on accessibility, making digital accessibility a part of the selection criteria for our new service desk provider and carrying out an accessibility diagnosis at our headquarters so that we can make a plan for improvements. A training course on inclusive hiring was introduced for recruiters and hiring managers and, as we are now an official partner of Disability:IN, we have the opportunity to measure our progress on a yearly basis.\n\n## A DEI pledge signed by Solvay's Senior Leadership Team\n\nBy creating two new companies through our Power of 2 project, we have a unique opportunity to ensure that our commitment to DEI is firmly embedded in their foundations. Solvay's Senior Leadership Team (SLT), including our CEO, have therefore all signed a DEI pledge with three concrete commitments to Solvay colleagues:\n\n- f Not to tolerate any behaviors that contradict the values of respect, openness, care and trust\n- f To personally engage in conversations with employees from under-represented groups, starting with taking part in two ERG-led events to expand understanding of issues that may not directly affect them\n- f To reserve time, as we do for safety topics, to discuss DEI within their leadership team and during their entity meetings\n\nOur commitment to developing a more inclusive company is illustrated by our annual Citizen Day event, which brought DEI to more than 100 Solvay sites.",

This allows us to ensure a high level of transparency, maturity and trust between senior management and social representatives.\n\nW\n\nIn 2022, we renewed our Solvay Global Forum* and Global Framework agreements with IndustriALL, the global union for the chemical industry. The agreements confirm Solvay's existing commitments in the areas of health - both mental and physical - and safety at work, the fight against discrimination, the promotion of diversity and respect for the environment, as well as respect for all international standards, such as those provided by the United Nations and the International Labor Organization.\n\n## We talk to... Marco Roumen\n\nCOORDINATOR OF THE SOLVAY GLOBAL FORUM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Solvay claims to be a responsible employer. What do you think about this?\n\nMarco Roumen Solvay is a very responsible employer. In fact, outside of Europe, where social policies are less developed, Solvay is seen as being distinctive because it proactively supports employees in ways that other companies are often slow to do. The special bonus offered to many employees in 2022 to help them deal with the high cost of living is a good example of this, as is the Group's global parental leave policy, which the Solvay Global Forum worked closely with Solvay management to achieve.\n\n## What would you say about Solvay to prospective employees?\n\nM.R. I would emphasize two points in particular. First, there is a lot of trust and transparency between the company and its employees. For example, employees are informed about strategic decisions and encouraged to give feedback, which increases trust and motivation. Second, Solvay really takes care of its employees. The social package offered through Solvay Cares and initiatives like the global agreement with IndustriALL Global Union really differentiate the Group from the rest of the industry, as does the Solvay Solidarity Fund, which was created during the Covid crisis to help Solvay employees, their families and the communities they live in when they need it most.\n\n## How could Solvay become an even more attractive employer?\n\nM.R.  Solvay is always looking for areas to improve. Even now, with the Power of 2 project at the top of the agenda, we continue to make progress on a number of initiatives. One big challenge moving forward will be ensuring that all of our social policies are transferred to the two new companies. We hope to achieve this by continuing the constructive dialogue we have had with Solvay management since the start of the Po2 project. In the social area, we believe that everyone in Solvay should work on the continuous improvement of social dialogue in all the regions where the Group is active in the world. In addition, following the success of the Solvay Shares program, it would make sense for employees to be represented on Solvay's Board.\n\n*Solvay Global Forum is an important platform for dialogue between top management and employee representatives.  It is composed of nine representatives from the Group's main countries.",

Our journey to voluntarily phase out the use of fluorosurfactants from the PFAS family of chemicals globally is\n\nongoing thanks to our investment in new technological innovations that advance our sustainability ambitions.\n\nW\n\nSince 2019, we have quadrupled our investment in research and innovation to develop new, breakthrough non-fluorosurfactant technologies that meet the performance needs of our customers in a more sustainable way. As a result, in July 2021, we were able to completely eliminate the use of fluorinated surfactants at our West Deptford, New Jersey facility in the US, transitioning our customers to more sustainable fluorinated polymers.\n\nIn 2022, we took another step forward: we announced that by 2026 we will manufacture nearly 100% of our fluoropolymers without fluorosurfactants, leading the industry in expanding our proprietary non-fluorosurfactant technology across our product lines. The fluorosurfactants have been used as process aids and Solvay did not sell these commercially in the market. One small product line at our Spinetta Marengo site in Italy -critical for the semiconductor and energy industries and representing less than 1% of production volume -will require further research and development to completely phase out the use of fluorosurfactants. While we continue our research, a tightly controlled, closed-loop and zero-liquid discharge production process will be used for this production line.\n\nFluoropolymers are needed to make materials that are critical for a sustainable society such as renewable energy installations, lithium-ion batteries and medical device components. Solvay's new polymerization process doesn't require the use of fluorosurfactants, yet it still provides the unique properties of fluorinated polymers that our customers need to make their products.\n\nWhile we work to phase out fluorosurfactants from our processes, we also continue to introduce state-of-the-art technologies to eliminate remaining fluorosurfactant emissions from our plants. We recently announced that we will invest \u20ac40 million euros in new technology at our Spinetta Marengo site. This will be used to improve water treatment systems, ensuring that fluorosurfactant emissions are eliminated at a level known as 'technical zero'.",

        "page_content": "Solvay's solutions go through many different modifications before they become part of our everyday lives, including raw materials extraction, production, processing, formulation and assembly. We work closely with suppliers, partners, customers and brand owners to share knowledge and unlock shared value for all across the value chain. This includes constantly raising the bar to reach our sustainability commitments by working together to build a greener, more agile and resilient supply chain. In 2022, we not only committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions, we also launched initiatives to strengthen bonds with our suppliers.\n\n## Bonding with our suppliers to make the value chain more sustainable\n\n- In April 2021, we launched our Supplier Engagement Program, aimed at encouraging our suppliers and buyers to adopt a sustainability mindset. Guided by our Solvay One Planet ambitions, we have been engaging with our suppliers to build a greener, more agile and resilient supply chain that ensures sustainable shared value for all.\n\nWe believe that the best ideas come from working together, so we called on our strategic suppliers to share collaborative ideas or projects that could help us achieve our goals in five areas: carbon footprint; circular economy; waste management; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); and human rights in the supply chain. This initiative, which is unique in our industry, produced around 60/uni00A0different project ideas. Of these, more than 20 innovation projects are now underway, focused on areas such as bio-based and recycled sourcing, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste recovery and human rights. Our 2022 Solvay Supplier Engagement Day gave us a chance to showcase these innovation efforts, fostering longer-term supplier collaboration that will improve sustainability across the value chain.\n\n410\n\ncore suppliers\n\n## Transforming the supply chain\n\n-/uni00A0Solvay is a founding member of Together for Sustainability (TfS), a global procurement-driven initiative that supports chemical companies and their suppliers in their efforts to improve sustainability performance.\n\nIn September 2022, TfS launched its Product Carbon Footprint Guidelines. These provide clear guidance for suppliers and corporations on how to calculate, monitor and reduce emissions across chemical supply chains.\n\nTo assess how advanced our suppliers are on this topic, and to make progress in reaching our Scope 3 target, at the end of 2022 we called on our top suppliers to collect and share the product carbon footprint (PCF) of the raw materials they supply. A second wave of requests is planned for 2023.\n\n## We talk to... Fabienne Prost, DIRECTOR KEY ACCOUNTS, GROUPE S\u00c9CH\u00c9 ENVIRONNEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroupe S\u00e9ch\u00e9 Environnement is a French company specializing/uni00A0in environmental services. Our strong partnership with them has developed over many years. We share several common interests and priorities, including the development of the circular economy, the recycling of specific materials, the/uni00A0decontamination of polluted soils, the management of hazardous waste and the treatment of effluents.\n\n## How would you describe your relationship with Solvay?\n\nFabienne Prost Transparency, responsiveness, innovation, synergy between the Solvay and S\u00e9ch\u00e9 teams, and good communication through constructive exchanges are the key factors that have enabled us to develop a successful relationship based on trust over many years. A good example of this relationship is our agreement with Solvay's Tavaux site to manage all their hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and to design and operate their biological sludge dehydration unit. Following the progress made to implement innovative digital solutions and a plan to encourage recycling, we renewed this contract for an additional three years in January 2022.\n\n## How do S\u00e9ch\u00e9 and Solvay work together to create sustainable value for all?\n\nF.P. One example is our subsidiary Speichim, which has developed a specific loop for recycling some effluents produced at Solvay's Salindres site. This solution enables the site to reuse around 800 metric tons of raw materials per year, following separation and purification. This allows the site to reduce its consumption of raw materials, lower the associated costs and improve their carbon footprint.\n\nw READ MORE PAGE 38",

Agency feedback also has a real impact on our priorities, as it helps us to better understand our stakeholders' key concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nn previous years we have focused our action plans on addressing the common strengths and weaknesses identified by the ratings agencies. This allowed us to achieve results in the top quartile, and sometimes even the top ten. However, questionnaires are evolving and agencies are now sometimes assessing the same dimensions differently. This means, for example, that while some ratings agencies identify 'green sales' as a strength for Solvay, based on the use of our\n\nSustainable Portfolio Management methodology, others identify it as a weakness, because of our limited use of biosourced raw materials.\n\nI\n\nDespite these challenges, we continue to take comments from ratings agencies very seriously. This includes addressing operational ecoefficiency and the need to reduce emissions more quickly through our Solvay One Planet commitments, which focus on reducing emissions and effluents that could impact biodiversity. We have also developed an ESG risk management approach for our supply chain, to address human rights and environmental impacts across our value chain.\n\n## Solvay's sustainability reporting recognized by the WBCSD\n\nOur 2021 Annual Integrated Report was listed in the top ten of the tenth edition of Reporting Matters, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) annual review of its member companies' sustainability and integrated reports.\n\n'In its Annual Integrated Report, Solvay presents a strong value-creation model focused on inputs, raw materials, production of ingredients, processing and formulation, and end markets, clearly mapped across different business segments. The report also includes detailed mapping of issue boundaries against material topics, clearly outlining where material issues impact along the value chain and the degree to which they are important and relevant from a stakeholder and financial perspective.'\n\n## REPORTING MATTERS,\n\nWORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Our main indexes 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MSCI 2\n\nIn 2022, Solvay received a rating of A (on a scale of AAA-CCC) in the MSCI ESG Ratings assessment. Solvay is in the top 15% in chemicals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CDP 3\n\nSolvay is rated A- by the CDP in the 2022 Climate Change questionnaire (from F to A) and is among the top 8% assessed for supplier engagement on climate change.\n\n## Moody's ESG Solutionstions\n\nSolvay ranks #6 in the chemical industry, with a score of 65/100.\n\n## BEL\u00ae ESG indextions\n\nSolvay is one of the 20 companies composing the new BEL\u00ae ESG\n\n- 1. Last update in March 2023. 2. MSCI ESG Research provides MSCI ESG Ratings on global public and a few private companies on a scale of AAA (leader) to CCC (laggard), according to exposure to industry-specific ESG risks and the ability to manage these risks relative to peers. 3. An international organization, CDP analyzes how companies integrate climate change into their strategies.\n\n## EcoVadis supplier\n\nsustainability ratings Solvay is in the top 2% of chemical companies rated by EcoVadis.\n\n## SUSTAINALYTICS\n\nSolvay is rated 'Medium ESG Risk' by Sustainalytics.\n\n## ISS-ESG\n\nSolvay is rated as a Prime Company with a score of Bby the ISS-ESG, ranking among the leaders in chemicals.",

These data have not been affected by possible subsequent restatements due to perimeter changes, IFRS/IAS standards evolution, changes in definition of APM, etc.\n\nOver the reference periods, the following main changes have occurred:\n\n2018:\n\nDivestment of Polyamide business still classified as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale since September 2017.\n\n2019:\n\nImplementation of IFRS 16;\n\nDivestment of Polyamide business still classified as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale since September 2017.\n\n2020:\n\nDisposal of the Polyamide business completed on January 31, 2020.\n\nAt the end of December 2020, the assets and liabilities related to some businesses have been reclassified as 'held for sale' (assets for a total amount of \u20ac229 million and liabilities for a total amount of \u20ac110 million):\n\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium chlorate business line and related assets in Povoa (Portugal);\n- \u00b7 the various fluorine chemicals assets in Onsan, South Korea, part of Special Chem;\n- \u00b7 the commodity amphoterics surfactants activities in Novecare;\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium percarbonate business line and related assets in Bad H\u00f6nningen (Germany);\n- \u00b7 the Barium Strontium business and the joint venture with Chemical Products Corporation (CPC); and\n- \u00b7 the Process Materials business (part of Composites).\n\n2021:\n\nDuring 2021, the assets and liabilities related to the following businesses previously classified as 'held for sale' were divested:\n\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium chlorate business line and related assets in Povoa (Portugal),\n- \u00b7 the various fluorine chemicals assets in Onsan, South Korea, part of Special Chem,\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium percarbonate business line and related assets in Bad H\u00f6nningen (Germany),\n- \u00b7 the Barium Strontium business and the joint venture with Chemical Products Corporation (CPC),\n- \u00b7 the Process Materials business (part of Composite Materials),\n- \u00b7 the Novecare amphoterics surfactants activities, and\n- \u00b7 the Novecare surfactants and anti-oxidants business in Rasal (India).\n\nThese divestments lead to a decrease in sales of \u20ac220 million in 2021 compared to 2020. There was no material capital gain/loss on these divestments.\n\nOn July 1, Solvay announced the closing of the acquisition, from Bayer, of a seed coating business, with facilities in M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, France, and tolling operations in the U.S. and Brazil. This is a natural extension to Solvay's own AgRHO\u00ae family of sustainable seed boosting solutions (part of Novecare) and supports the drive toward more bio-based, sustainable technologies.\n\n2022:\n\nOn May 4, Solvay announced the acquisition of the 20% minority stake of AGC in the Soda Ash JV operated in Green River, WY, USA, building on its leadership position in trona-based soda ash production. There were no material events after the reporting period. At a cash purchase price of $120/uni00A0 million, this transaction will be significantly value accretive to Solvay, with a post tax cash return on capital in excess of 15%. The transaction is expected to be completed on May 4, 2022.\n\n## 1.2.  Extra-financial figures\n\nSince 2019, Solvay has embarked on a sustainability journey that is captured in the Solvay One Planet roadmap, which is an integral element of its G.R.O.W. strategy and company Purpose. Structured around the three major categories of climate, resources and better life, Solvay One Planet is a roadmap towards a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. Solvay made significant progress on this journey in 2022, accelerating efforts to meet stakeholders' growing expectations. The table below provides an update on Solvay's progress.",

Coke and anthracite used in the soda ash production process are not included.\n- (c)  2021 figure has been restated including the new circularity KPI used in 2022. It comprises products either: based on recycled or renewable materials, produced with renewable energy, with increasing longevity in the use phase or enabling recycling at the end of life.\n- (b) Effective 2022, the internal CO 2 price was increased from \u20ac75 to \u20ac100 per metric ton CO 2 eq. As a consequence, the level for 2021 has been restated to 50% (from 53%).\n- (d) The apparent increase of freshwater withdrawal in 2022 is mainly due to a stricter application of internal reporting rules for freshwater pumped by Solvay but sold to third parties. From the 330 million cubic meters for 2022, 30 (9%) is sold to third parties. The total freshwater withdrawal in 2022 is slightly lower than in 2021 (-1.7 million cubic meters or -0.5%) at constant scope and methodology.\n- (f)  Management categories are defined on the basis of the Hay Job Evaluation Methodology. Middle and senior management levels refer to the entire active internal workforce having Hay points above 530.\n- (e)  The definition of the indicator changed in 2020: RIIR replaced MTAR - RIIR: (Reportable Injury & Illness rate): number of reportable injury or illness per 200,000 work hours. Scope: Employees and contractors.\n\n## Climate\n\nIn October 2021, Solvay announced its plans to reach carbon neutrality on scope 1 and 2 emissions before 2040 for all businesses except Soda Ash & Derivatives and before 2050 for Soda Ash & Derivatives. Consequently, the 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions was upgraded to reduce by -30%, as compared to the 2018 baseline. In 2022, Solvay delivered a -19% GHG emissions reduction in four years, of which -15% structural, meaning almost 2x the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs part of its transition to cleaner energy sources, Solvay has also identified 23 additional new emission reduction projects which brings the total number of approved projects worldwide to 59. It will represent -3.5 million tonnes of CO 2 annually (equivalent to taking 1.9 million cars off the road).\n\nIn response to the gas crisis, Solvay temporarily adjusted its energy sourcing strategy. This is reflected in the coal phase-out performance. The phase out of coal for energy production has been planned for three soda ash plants in Europe: Rheinberg, Germany; Dombasle, France and Devnya, Bulgaria. With the additional phase-out project in the Green River site, US, the Group will cut its global emissions by 9.5% by 2025.\n\nRenewable electricity projects are also advancing. In the US, six businesses and 34 plants are fully supplied by green power, twice as many as in 2021. In China, 100% of operations are now supplied with renewable electricity. In Europe, progress continues with significant projects confirmed to switch plants in Voikka (Finland), Saint Fons and Tavaux (France) to green electricity.\n\nSolvay has decreased its global pressure on biodiversity by -28% versus 2018. The overall trend is aligned with 2030 targets, with part of this progress related to refinements in the methodology and new local projects implemented. Strong efforts have been implemented to design biodiversity roadmaps in order to reduce damage on nature and start regenerating Biodiversity. A list of top 32 sensitive sites has been established, guidelines are being defined with the WildLife Habitat Council, and first roadmaps being created.",

        "page_content": "## Resources\n\nIn 2022, the proportion of sales from sustainable solutions reached 55%, a 5% annual increase. It reflects the organic growth in the automotive and battery market with Specialty Polymers and Silica, in the agro market with Novecare, in air and water treatments with Peroxides and Soda Ash & Derivatives.\n\nThe group made significant progress in circularity with a 9.3% of its sales of circular products. This result is getting closer to the 2030 target, with part of this progress related to methodology improvement. Solvay is already a market leader in some bio-polymers like guar, bio-sourced solvents and natural vanillin. Solvay is also investing in a powerful Rare Earths hub in La Rochelle, France to play a proactive role in the recycling of magnets. The collaboration between the Materials business and the French startup Carbios on the enzymatic recycling of polymers is another example. Finally, the new Solvay growth platform on Renewable Materials and Biotechnology will facilitate the development of safer chemicals, foster more environmentally-friendly solutions and enhance circularity.\n\nInnovation to develop more sustainable solutions is a continuous process for Solvay teams partnering with customers to develop tailor-mode solutions. In 2022 Solvay opened a new Application development center in Alpharetta, Georgia, in the US. The Group is also investing in the upgrade of the 160/uni00A0yearold soda ash manufacturing process to reduce the CO 2 emissions by 50%, while reducing resource consumption and eliminating limestone residues. A pilot is being implemented at the Dombasle, France site.\n\nIn 2022, the apparent increase of freshwater withdrawal in 2022 is mainly due to a stricter application of internal reporting rules for freshwater pumped by Solvay but sold to third parties. Solvay launched various water management initiatives to address water scarcity like the creation of a dashboard that monitors around 90% of the Group's daily freshwater intake. Solvay also conducted a review of water risks. Seven sites have designed roadmaps to improve their resilience, with the potential to achieve 30 million cubic meters in water intake reduction.\n\nIn 2022, Solvay exceeded its 2030 target with a -36% reduction of its non-recoverable industrial waste. Valorization, recycling and use in waste-to-energy programs are the key levers to reach the zero waste to landfill target. For example, the calcium fluoride (CaF2)-rich sludge produced at the Panoli site (India) is now reused as an additive in a cement plant instead of going to landfill. Another example is in the Augusta US site, where the volume of the waste polymer stream has decreased by 76% compared to 2021. Finally, the Collonges site (France) is valorizing the discarded silica by providing to customers a new range of products for other uses.\n\n## Better Life\n\nIn 2022, the number of injuries has decreased to 0.34 (versus 0.43 in 2021), despite higher production levels. Despite all efforts, a dramatic accident occurred. The Group triggered a strong action plan to raise the bar to reach the zero accident target.\n\nRegarding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), major milestones have been achieved this year. The Group took concrete actions to improve pay equity, created the 'homogeneity index', achieved parity at the senior management level (SLC) and included the DEI roadmap within the 15% One Planet part of the Short Term Incentive.\n\nSolvay also has nine Employee Resource Groups (ERG), which are grassroots groups led and run by employees that encourage employees to recognize and celebrate diversity, which is a critical component to guide the DEI journey. The different ERGs have suggested a DEI pledge that has been signed by the entire Senior Leadership Team.\n\nIn 2022, more than 100 sites, reaching more than 40% of Solvay's global workforce, devoted time to improving their awareness of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) as part of Solvay's One Dignity initiative. Their participation was converted into a \u20ac50,000 donation, which will be spent with local charities promoting DEI in the 14 countries that had the most participation.\n\nThe Group provided support for its employees with \u20ac9.5 million to be distributed among the people most affected by inflation. Solvay launched its first employee share plan in 2022, achieving an impressive participation rate of 27.7%, which is ahead of the benchmark for similar initiatives. And finally, Solvay increased its Global Performance Sharing (GPS) Plan budget to \u20ac15 million, for the 'non-executive' employees.\n\nIn 2022, the Group renewed its Solvay Global Forum and Global Framework agreements with IndustriAll Global Union, the global union for the chemicals industry.\n\nMore information in the extra-financial report.",

        "page_content": "## 2. PREPARATION BACKGROUND\n\n## 2.1.  Comparability of results & reconciliation of underlying Income Statement indicators\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents alternative performance indicators ('underlying') to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of the Group's underlying financial performance and financial position, as well as cash flows. These indicators provide a balanced view of the Group's operations and are considered useful to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies as these measures provide relevant information on the Group's past or future performance, financial position or cash flows. These indicators are generally used in the sector it operates in and therefore serve as a useful aid for investors to compare the Group's performance with its peers. The underlying performance indicators adjust IFRS figures for the noncash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds, classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, for impairments and for other elements that would distort the analysis of the Group's underlying performance.\n\n## 2.2.  Alternative performance metric (APM)\n\nSolvay measures its financial performance using alternative performance metrics, which can be found below. Solvay believes that these measurements are useful for analyzing and explaining changes and trends in its historical results of operations, as they allow performance to be compared on a consistent basis. Definitions of the different metrics presented here are included in the glossary at the end of this financial report.\n\n## 2.3.  Description of the operational segments\n\nSolvay is organized in the following operating segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Materials offer a unique portfolio of high-performance polymers and composite technologies used primarily in sustainable mobility applications. Its solutions enable weight reduction and enhance performance while improving CO 2 and energy efficiency. Major markets served include nextgeneration mobility in automotive and aerospace, healthcare and electronics.\n- \u00b7 Chemicals host chemical intermediate businesses focused on mature and resilient markets. Solvay is a world leader in soda ash and peroxides and major markets served include building and construction, consumer goods and food. Its Silica, Coatis and RusVinyl businesses are also high quality assets with strong positions in their markets.\n- \u00b7 Solutions offer a unique formulation & application expertise through customized specialty formulations for surface chemistry & liquid behavior, maximizing yield and efficiency of the processes they are used in while minimizing the eco-impact.

The +\u20ac74 million improvement year over year is mainly due to the continued benefits of stabilization of our energy business which recorded a -\u20ac34 million one-time loss recorded in Q4 2021 in relation to energy supply to third parties.\n\n## 5. RECONCILIATION OF UNDERLYING AND IFRS MEASURES\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents underlying Income Statement performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of Solvay's economic performance. These figures adjust IFRS figures for the non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, and for other elements to generate a measure that avoids distortion and facilitates the appreciation of performance and comparability of results over time.\n\nEBITDA on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac3,144 million, versus \u20ac3,229 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac84 million is explained by the following adjustments to IFRS results, which are done to improve the comparability of underlying results:\n\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac322 million in 'other operating gains and losses', for the gains related to the management of the CO 2 hedges, not accounted for as Cash Flow Hedge, deferred until the maturity of the economic hedge.\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac10 million in 'Earnings from associates & joint ventures' for Solvay's share in the financial charges of the RusVinyl joint venture and the foreign exchange results on the \u20ac-denominated debt of the joint venture, due to the strengthening of the RUB against the EUR over the period.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac133 million to adjust for the 'Result from portfolio management and major restructuring' (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment elements), includes separation costs incurred for the project aimed at the separation of the Group into two independent, publicly listed companies.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac283 million to adjust for the 'Result from legacy remediation and major litigations'. Moreover the variation of environmental provisions were impacted from the revised assumptions of higher inflation rates.\n\nEBIT on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac2,221 million, versus \u20ac2,426 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac205 million is explained by the abovementioned \u20ac84 million adjustments at the EBITDA level and \u20ac121 million of ' Depreciation, amortization & impairments '. The latter consist of:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u20ac149 million to adjust for the non-cash impact of purchase price allocation (PPA), consisting of amortization charges on intangible assets, which are\n\nadjusted in \"\n\nResearch & development costs\n\n\" for \u20ac3 million, and in \"\n\nOther operating gains & losses\n\n\" for \u20ac146 million.\n\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac28 million to adjust for the net impact of impairments reversal reported in ' Result from portfolio management and major restructuring ' resulting primarily from the improved performance of some Special Chem assets.\n\nNet financial charges on an IFRS basis were \u20ac-71 million versus \u20ac-202 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac-132 million adjustment made to IFRS net financial charges mainly consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac82 million reclassification of coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds, which are treated as dividends under IFRS, and as financial charges in underlying results.\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac15 million reclassification of financial charges and realized foreign exchange result on the \u20ac-denominated debt of RusVinyl as net financial charges.\n- \u00b7 -\u20ac59 million for the net impact of increasing discount rates on the valuation of environmental liabilities in the period.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac13 million for losses on financial instruments at fair value through P&L",

OUTLOOK\n\nIn the context of the current macro environment, we expect volumes to be softer in certain key markets. As a result full-year underlying EBITDA is currently estimated between -3% and -9% versus 2022. Free Cash Flow is estimated at around \u20ac750 million reflecting the current cycle of growth investments that is underway.",

The Board met with the ELT nine times during the period under review. The Board supported the ELT in the delivery of strong results and in ensuring that Solvay remains on track to meet strategic and transformational objectives. This strategic performance was achieved in a complex geopolitical context. The Board ensures that sustainable value is created for all shareholders.\n\nFollowing thorough evaluation of a range of strategic options to unlock and accelerate value creation, the Board decided to review plans to separate Solvay into two independent publicly listed companies, currently known as EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo. The separation will gather similar business models into separate companies, differentiate capital structures as well as strategic objectives to enhance strategic focus and accelerate value-accretive sustainable growth. It will build on the strong foundations established in recent years, and benefit of all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and employees. Solvac/uni00A0SA, Solvay's reference shareholder, has publicly communicated its support for the separation project. For further details, please refer to the introduction section of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nIn addition to core strategic and financial objectives, business performance reviews at Board level take also into account progress on Solvay's One Planet sustainability roadmap, and all key business decisions integrate relevant non-financial Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations. As part of their Continuous Training Program, the Board visited Solvay's Spinetta Marengo site, in Italy, which gave them an opportunity to test and experience many aspects of the Group's transformation at a key industrial site. This included seeing how talents are grown and developed, and how cost improvements and safety in operations are driven, as well as gaining an insight into continuous process innovation, growth projects, and sustainability challenges and opportunities at the site.\n\nMain decisions taken by the Board during the period under review include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of plans to separate Solvay into two independent publicly listed companies (Power of Two, Po2), marking the next phase of Solvay's transformation.\n- \u00b7 Extension of the carbon neutrality targets, with a commitment to decrease Solvay's indirect Scope/uni00A03 emissions by 24%. This development was supported by the ESG Committee that was created in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Announcement of the phase-out roadmap for fluorosurfactants in Italy, following a similar move in the/uni00A0US in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Investment in the electric vehicle (EV) batteries (in France, China and the US), semiconductor and natural ingredients industries, and in expanding soda ash capacity.\n- \u00b7 Approval of supplementary financial remuneration for more junior employees to help combat unprecedented increases in the cost of living, with around \u20ac9.5/uni00A0million in the form of one-time bonuses and a 50% increase in the Global Performance Sharing Plan budget, which now totals \u20ac15 million.\n- \u00b7 Election of two new, independent Board members at the 2022 Shareholders Meeting, increasing the Board's independence and diversity.\n- \u00b7 A new Remuneration Policy, submitted to the vote of the 2022 Shareholders Meeting, which reflects strategic priorities and global best practices.\n- \u00b7 Strong support from the Board for the CEO and management team to accelerate decisions to invest in promoting the sustainability of our product portfolio, our facilities and the well-being of our employees, and in particular in our soda ash operations in Rosignano, Italy.",

The ELT has mobilized a dedicated task force, led by a highly-experienced and dedicated team, with the intention to deliver on the separation during the second half of 2023, subject to general market conditions and to meeting a number of customary conditions, including shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting. This approach was chosen to ensure that business and functional leadership remain focused on operational delivery and are not distracted by matters best handled by the separation task force.\n\nThe macroeconomic and geopolitical context in 2022 was extremely complex. Covid-19 continued to impact operations in some jurisdictions, while exceptionally high inflationary pressures impacted costs. Logistic and supply chain dislocations and challenges affected certain markets, and the ramifications of the war in Europe could easily have threatened the supply of energy and raw materials, thereby undermining business continuity. Consequently, the ELT promoted a sharp organizational focus to preserve operational resilience, equally intensify customer interactions and preserve pricing power to protect margins. The ELT frequently interacted with the extended business and functional leadership teams collectively. The ELT met twelve times in person in 2022. The ELT members shared information which helped to align priorities allowing Solvay to deliver excellent performance.\n\nWe also continued to focus on cash generation in 2022. This helped support important investments, laying the foundations for superior and sustainable growth. Extensive progress was made in relation to our Solvay One Planet targets, especially with our new Scope 3 commitments, an innovative breakthrough in the soda ash production process that will now proceed to pilot phase and the phasing out of fluorosurfactants. In addition, progress has been made in advancing our Group's diversity, equity and inclusion mindset. This includes a number of concrete initiatives, such as the adoption of a plan to close gender pay gaps.\n\n<!-- image -->",

INTRODUCTION\n\nSolvay SA - headquartered in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris - is committed to upholding the highest level of Belgian governance practices and disclosures. We consistently seek to strengthen our corporate governance practices and disclosures, emphasizing transparency and promoting a culture of sustainable long-term value creation, in line with our Purpose.\n\nSolvay's Board is responsible for maintaining the Group's long-term strategic thinking and for overseeing, challenging and supporting the ELT's implementation of Solvay's strategy.\n\nIn accordance with Belgian law, Solvay adheres to the principles and provisions of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code (the 'Belgian Governance Code'), which is based on a 'comply or explain' principle. The English, Dutch and French versions of the Belgian Governance Code can be found on the website of the Belgian Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nSolvay's Board has adopted a Corporate Governance Charter (the 'Charter'). The Charter was last amended on December 11, 2019 and is available on Solvay's corporate website. It describes the main aspects of Solvay's approach to corporate governance, including the governance structure and the internal rules of the Board, the ELT and committees set up by the Board.\n\nIn addition, Solvay publishes a Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Integrated Report, which includes the information required by the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (hereafter the 'Code of Companies and Associations' or 'BCCA') and the Belgian Governance Code. The Corporate Governance Statement includes additional factual information regarding Solvay's corporate governance practices and relevant modifications to this, together with details on the remuneration of directors and executives and on relevant events that took place during the preceding year. This/uni00A0section of the Annual Integrated Report constitutes Solvay's Corporate Governance Statement for the year 2022.\n\n## 2. CAPITAL, SHARES AND SHAREHOLDERS\n\n## 2.1.  Capital\n\nSolvay's share capital amounts to \u20ac1,588,146,240 and comprises 105,876,416 issued shares. No changes were made to Solvay's capital in 2022.\n\n## 2.2.  Solvay shares\n\nSolvay (SOLB.BE) is listed on Euronext Brussels, which is our primary listing. Solvay has a secondary listing on Euronext Paris. Since September 9, 2021, Solvay shares have also been traded over the counter (OTC) as an unsponsored American Depository Receipt (ADR).\n\nSolvay is a member of the BEL20, the main Belgian index. On September 14, 2018, Solvay became part of the CAC Next20 index and is considered to be the largest (specialty) chemicals company on Euronext Paris. Solvay shares are part of other major indexes including the BEL Chemicals, STOXX family (DJ STOXX, DJ Euro STOXX, STOXX Europe 600 chemicals), MSCI index, Euronext/uni00A0100, Dow Jones Sustainability TM World Index and FTSE4Good Index.\n\nDuring 2022, the average share price at end of day close was \u20ac91.18 while the 52-week range was \u20ac76.42 to \u20ac111.65 (closing price) per share. Solvay's closing share price on December 30, 2022 was \u20ac94.46, which represents an increase of 7.5% compared to the end of 2021.\n\nAverage daily trading volume as reported by Euronext was 207,206 in 2022, compared to 165,376/uni00A0shares in 2021, representing \u20ac18.5 million exchanged per day. Solvay's closing share price on December 30, 2022 was \u20ac94.46, which represents a decrease of 7.6% compared to the end of 2021. In addition to Euronext, there are other alternative trading platforms and dark pools where investors are able to buy and sell Solvay shares.\n\nWe also carried out additional analysis to compare Solvay's liquidity with indices and peers. Taking into account what the company considers as 'accessible liquidity', which includes Euronext and some easily accessible platforms and dark pools, the daily liquidity of Solvay can be expressed as 61/uni00A0basis points (bps) of our free float. In comparison, the shares of BEL 20 issuers trades, on average, at 54bps of its daily free float, and the median of Solvay peers, including BASF, DSM, AkzoNobel, Croda, Covestro, Umicore, Arkema, EMS, Johnson Matthey, Evonik, Clariant, Lanxess, Victrex, Ashland and Hexcel, is 73bps.",

This amounts to a combined interest in Solvay of 3.39%.\n- \u00b7 Solvay Stock Option Management (SSOM) SRL, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Solvay, held 2,236,739 Solvay shares representing a total of 2,11% of the total number of shares issued by Solvay.\n- \u00b7 The remaining shares, comprising approximately 64%, are held by institutional and retail shareholders.\n\n## Solvac\n\nSolvay's largest shareholder is Solvac/uni00A0SA ('Solvac'). Solvac/uni00A0SA is a public limited liability company established under Belgian law, founded in 1983. Its annual reports indicate that its primary asset consists of shares in Solvay.\n\nSolvac's shares are traded on Euronext Brussels. It has approximately 14,000/uni00A0shareholders. Among these, approximately 2,400/uni00A0individuals are related to the founding families of Solvay and Solvac, which, combined, are reported to hold approximately 77.32% of Solvac shares.\n\nSolvac's Board expressed its strategic investment objective in Solvay in its 2021 Corporate Governance Statement:\n\n'Solvac supports the development of Solvay's strategy focused on its transformation towards world leadership in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. Solvac supports the Solvay One Planet initiative and its ambitious commitments. Solvac underlines the importance for it to see Solvay maintain its policy of stability and, if possible, increasing dividends, as well as prudent financial discipline leading to an investment grade qualification of its short and long term debt.'\n\nAs of March 15, 2022, Solvac's Board expressed its support to the Solvay's project to explore its separation into two independent publicly listed companies.\n\nA relationship agreement with Solvac has not been considered necessary, given Solvac's stated investment objective and track record of engagement with Solvay since its initial investment in/uni00A01983. Solvay's articles of association do not provide for any special director nomination rights for Solvac.\n\n## Solvay Stock Option Management\n\nSolvay Stock Option Management SRL (SSOM) is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Solvay. As of December 31, 2022, SSOM held 2,107,752 Solvay shares and 631,124 call options.

By purchasing shares in Solvay, participants received a free share on joining the scheme and a matched share for every two Solvay shares purchased. Free and matching shares are subject to a two years holding period.\n\nThe stock ownership plan, which is subject to a maximum envelope of 250,000 shares in the 2022 plan, is available to all Solvay employees in the 22 countries in which local regulations permit us to offer it.\n\nThe aim of the program is to mobilize thousands of employees to act as entrepreneurs and owners, broadening their perspectives and encouraging them to embrace all opportunities to drive the Group's transformation and to create superior, responsible and sustainable value.\n\nThe one-year Employee Share Purchase Program started in November 2022. After two months, 19, 442 shares have been purchased under this plan by our employees. More shares will be purchased in the next 10 months.\n\n## 2.4.  Relations with investors and analysts\n\nSolvay maintains an open, ongoing and constructive dialogue with the investment community. We always seek to provide pertinent and accurate information to ensure understanding of Solvay business and strategy, helping the financial community to make their own informed assessments and judgments. Detailed information on our business activities, strategy and financial performance is available through various regulatory and other publications, such as the Annual Integrated Report, financial reports and press releases, as well as other media, such as webcasts, which are available on our website.\n\nThe Investor Relations team maintains a close relationship with investors throughout the year. The CEO and CFO also prioritize interactions with the investment community. Solvay's teams have been agile and flexible in maintaining these interactions, supplementing the use of digital technologies with a return to face-to-face meetings.\n\nIt is important to note that Solvay adheres to the guidelines issued by the FSMA (Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority) and complies with the disclosure obligations defined by Belgian law and contained in the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (MAR).\n\nOn March 15, 2022, Solvay announced that we were reviewing plans to separate the Company into two independent publicly listed companies. The two companies, which are currently referred to as EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo, are expected to be leaders in their industries, each with a clearly defined strategic focus, and well-positioned to enhance value for shareholders, customers and team members alike. This strategic intention drove significant interest and questions during our interactions with the financial community.",

        "page_content": "Solvay's management team are proactively addressing the desire of the investors and shareholders to deepen their understanding of the key activities the Company pursues. After the positive feedback on our ESG webinar in December 2021, which focused on the progress Solvay has made to reduce our environmental impact, the company committed to hosting a series of educational webinars to cover key Group activities. These help investors better understand the strategic positioning of the main parts of Solvay's portfolio. In February 2022, the series continued with a focus on the Materials segment serving the Automotive industry, which is driven primarily by the trends of lightweighting and electrification.\n\nFollowing the announcement of our plans to separate Solvay into two companies, we accelerated this educational webinar series with sessions on Solvay's consumer-facing businesses. This included sessions on our Novecare and Aroma Performance businesses in June 2022, and a webinar about our Peroxides business in October 2022. Two webinars also took place in late February 2023, focused on aerospace and defense activities, and on our Soda Ash business. These webinars, combined with the planned Capital Market Days presenting the strategy of the two new entities, should help investors assess the quality of each entity and its future potential.\n\nRecordings of these webinars are available on the investors section of our website.\n\n## 2.4.1. Interactions with shareholders, Solvac and Solvay founding families\n\nEvery shareholder has access to clear, comprehensive, transparent information, tailored to his or her individual needs, through a dedicated section on the Solvay website. Solvay also engages with retail banks, regularly interacting with their analysts and participating in events dedicated to private investors.\n\nIn 2022, Solvay holds regular meetings with our major reference shareholder, Solvac. The CEO and CFO gave four presentations to Solvac's Board of Directors in 2022, covering the Solvay Group's half- and full-year results, the project to separate Solvay into two companies and a general overview of the Peroxides business.\n\nIn addition, Solvay's management participated in two events organized by shareholders from Solvay's founding families to update them on strategy and results. A group of 30 shareholders from Solvay's founding families went to visit the biomass boiler at Solvay's Rheinberg site in Germany.\n\n## 2.4.2. Interactions with sell-side analysts\n\nSolvay is covered by 21/uni00A0sell-side analysts who regularly publish research on the Company. The up-to-date list of analysts can be found on Solvay's website.\n\nApart from regular individual meetings, emails and phone conversations, Solvay organizes quarterly conference calls and webinar series between the senior management and the financial community, following the publication of the Group's results. Although specifically geared toward analysts, these conference calls are accessible live to all investors, and remain available in the form of a video and transcript on the Solvay website.\n\nWhere opportunities permit, such as when Solvay management undertakes investor roadshows or participates in investor conferences, face-to-face meetings with analysts are also periodically arranged in major financial cities, including Brussels, London, Paris, New York and Boston.\n\n## 2.4.3. Interactions with institutional investors\n\nSolvay mainly interacts with institutional investors following the announcement of quarterly, half- and full-year results. In 2022, Solvay participated in 48/uni00A0 events, 32/uni00A0 of which involved senior management. This included seven digital roadshows and 37/uni00A0 conferences in countries across Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nSolvay's CEO and the CFO are present in many of the meetings with the financial community. They discuss different topics, including quarterly earnings results, market conditions, the prospects for the current year and the medium-term strategy. Due to the volatility caused by the energy crisis in 2022, particular attention was given to pricing power and cost savings, cash and cash conversion, investments in growth areas and in our sites, deleveraging of our net debt, maintaining a strong credit rating and sustaining a strong dividend.\n\n## 2.4.4. Interactions with stewardship teams at shareholders and ESG research providers, including proxy advisors\n\nAt least once a year, the CEO, the CFO, the Group General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, the Chief People Officer, the Chief Sustainability and Government Affairs Officer, and the Head of Investor Relations meet with the stewardship teams of institutional investors and ESG Research providers, including proxy advisors. The purpose of this engagement exercise is to provide an update on Solvay's key ESG targets, as well as our performance. In/uni00A02022, topics included:\n\n- \u00b7 the strengthening of Solvay's climate commitments through our new Scope 3 objective;\n- \u00b7 the actions and investments made to reinforce responsible site management;\n- \u00b7 innovation in the soda ash production process;\n- \u00b7 the phasing out of fluorosurfactants globally;\n- \u00b7 the launch of our first global employee share purchase plan.\n\nSolvay also treats these engagements as an opportunity to understand changes in the methodologies and policies used by the stewardship teams, as/uni00A0well as to actively solicit their feedback on how Solvay can improve ESG practices and disclosures.\n\nDuring 2022, Solvay engaged with a dozen stewardship teams made up of top shareholders. These meetings were attended by various members of the Executive Leadership Team, including Solvay's CEO.",

With a focus on bringing new perspectives, while also strengthening its independence, Solvay has continued to refresh the Board through the addition of six new members over the past five years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Board was composed of 15 directors and had the following attributes:\n\n- \u00b7 The role of chair and CEO are separated.\n- \u00b7 Fourteen of the 15 directors on the Board are non-executive, representing diverse competencies, as highlighted in the table below.\n- \u00b7 Ten of the 15 directors are considered to be independent non-executive directors, according to the criteria defined by the Belgian Governance Code, and have been recognized as such by the respective Ordinary Shareholders Meetings during which they were elected.\n- \u00b7 Six of the 15/uni00A0directors were appointed in the past five years.\n- \u00b7 The Board's 15/uni00A0members have a four-year mandate, except for H./uni00A0Coppens/uni00A0d'Eeckenbrugge (three years) and R./uni00A0Thorne (one year).\n- \u00b7 Directors represent seven different nationalities.\n- \u00b7 Seven of the 15/uni00A0directors, including the CEO, are women.\n- \u00b7 The overall meeting attendance by directors in 2022 was 94.4%.\n\nAt the Ordinary Shareholder Meeting of May 10, 2022, Mr./uni00A0 Philippe/uni00A0 Tournay's term ended in 2022 and was not renewed. Mr./uni00A0 Pierre/uni00A0 Gurdjian and Ms./uni00A0Laurence/uni00A0Debroux were appointed as new Directors of the Board for a four-year team, until the end of the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting to be held in May 2026.\n\nAt the end of the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting of May 9, 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 The mandate of Ms./uni00A0Rosemary/uni00A0Thorne will expire. Her mandate will be proposed for renewal for a limited period of an additional one year, to ensure continuity until the completion of Solvay's potential separation into two independent publicly listed companies.\n- \u00b7 The mandates of Mr./uni00A0Charles/uni00A0 Casimir-Lambert and Ms./uni00A0 Marjan/uni00A0 Oudeman will expire. The mandate of Ms./uni00A0Marjan/uni00A0 Oudeman will be proposed for renewal for another four-year term, until the end of the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting to be held in May 2027. Mr./uni00A0Charles/uni00A0Casimir-Lambert has decided not to request the renewal of his mandate. No replacement is foreseen; as a consequence, the number of the Board members will be fourteen.",

All the Board members are actively engaged on the topic of sustainability, through dedicated Board meetings. The ESG Committee members have strong ESG credentials. See more information in 3.1.16.\n\n## 3.1.3. Diversity at Board level\n\nThe composition of the Board satisfies the legal requirements applicable in Belgium relating to gender diversity. Furthermore, Solvay not only aims to ensure the gender diversity of its directors, but also diversity in age, nationalities, experience, education and skillsets. Details of the qualifications and experience of the Board members can be found in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. Solvay's commitment to diversity at Board level is further evidenced by the criteria for appointment of directors listed in section 5.3.2 of the Charter, which is available on Solvay's corporate website.\n\n## 3.1.4. Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nIn 2022, the Board held nine meetings. Each director's attendance is shown in the table in section 3.1.1. Structure and composition. All Board members attended more than 75% of the Board and Committee meetings they were eligible to attend, with the exception of Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand. She has been a Board member since 2017 and has had a strong attendance record in previous years, but has missed three Board meetings during the period under review for personal reasons. However, Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand provided her written opinion in advance on matters to be discussed at the Board meetings she missed, and was also updated with the meeting minutes after each meeting.\n\nBoard discussions, reviews and decisions focused on, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the annual review of Group strategy;\n- \u00b7 strategic projects, such as acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure, capital allocation, financial reporting, the review of Solvay's sustainability initiatives, risk management, intra-group restructuring, Board composition, and the reports and resolution proposals for the Shareholders Meeting.\n\nThe Board decided to review plans, announced in March 2022, to separate Solvay into two independent publicly listed companies, marking the next phase of Solvay's transformation. Upon completion, the separation would establish two strong industry leaders that would benefit from the strategic and financial flexibility to focus on their distinctive business models, market and stakeholder priorities.",

The latter will involve manufacturing nearly 100% of Solvay's fluoropolymers without the use of fluorosurfactants, at the Spinetta Marengo site in Italy. Solvay also announced plans to significantly reduce the release of limestone residues directly into the sea from the facility in Rosignano, Italy, as well as a long-term objective to invest in a new soda ash production process intended to be adopted globally. This new process should enable Solvay to further cut CO 2 emissions and reduce any discharge of limestone residues to zero by 2050. On the social side, among various other initiatives, the Board supported the launch of a global employee share purchase plan, whereby any Solvay employee can invest in Solvay's future.\n\nThe Group's financial situation and business continuity was closely monitored, especially given the high inflationary context, disruptions caused in the logistics and supply chain, and the energy crisis resulting from the war in Europe. As an example, the Board strongly supported the ELT's decision to suspend operations and new investments. Solvay also suspended dividend payments from Rusvinyl, an independent 50:50 joint venture in Russia.\n\nDuring 2022, article 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations, relating to conflict of interests, was applied by the Board of Directors on several occasions.\n\nOn January 25, the procedure was applied with the independent collaboration agreement of the CEO, as follows:\n\n' Ilham Kadri was in a situation of conflict of interest, as set out in article 7:96 of the BCCA, in view of the fact that the contract setting out her remuneration was to be discussed. Therefore, she was not present in the room when this item was debated and did not participate in the vote. The Secretary General was also absent during the discussion. The Chairman explained that Solvay and Dr. Kadri have entered into a new independent collaboration agreement regarding her functions of CEO and member and President of the Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif/ELT.\n\nA lot of contextual elements have changed during her first years as a CEO and it seemed appropriate and necessary to reflect these changes into a new agreement three years after the first appointment of Dr. Kadri. Therefore this new agreement aims to reinforce and reassert the trust of the Board of Directors towards Dr. Kadri. Ultimately this will allow Dr. Kadri and Solvay to further strengthen a mutual and trustworthy relationship.\n\nIn particular, this new convention is addressing the terms and conditions in the context of a departure of Dr. Kadri from Solvay and, in addition, the protection of Solvay with reinforced non-compete undertakings in case the collaboration would come to an end.\n\nThe amendments to the fixed and variable remuneration of Dr. Kadri aim to align the agreement to the amendments previously decided for the members of the ELT in the context of the new Executive Compensation 2022.\n\nRegarding the new provisions relating to severance pay, the following should be noted:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase of the severance fee to 18 months of remuneration in case Solvay terminates the agreement, which gives a strong trust signal towards Dr./uni00A0Kadri regarding the continuation of the cooperation in the context of the numerous challenges faced by Solvay. The severance pay is computed on the basis of the sum of the fixed and variable remuneration, as well as other benefits (including pension and assistance budget).\n- \u00b7 The introduction of a 12 months non-compete indemnity corresponding to six months of remuneration, computed in the same way as the severance fee due in case of termination by Solvay, is now also reinforced in case of termination by Solvay (and not only in case of termination by Dr. Kadri).\n- \u00b7 The amount of the non-compete fee is considered reasonable given the duration of the non-compete and non-solicit period of 12 months.\n\nAfter review of the advice of the Remuneration Committee, the directors present unanimously approved the revised CEO convention (including for the avoidance of doubt, the clauses relating to severance fee).\n\nIn accordance with article 7:92 of the BCCA, the provisions on severance fees are entered into under condition precedent of their approval by the next Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall also inform the Works Council. '\n\nOn February 22, the procedure was applied in relation to decisions regarding the CEO's remuneration:\n\n' Prior to any discussion or decision by the Board on this agenda item, Ilham Kadri declared that she had a direct financial interest in the implementation of the Board's decisions regarding her ex-2021 bonus and 2022 remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Article 7:96 of the Companies and Associations Code, Ilham Kadri withdrew so as not to be present during the Board's deliberations on this decision and not to take part in the vote.\n\nThe Board established that Article 7:96 of the Companies and Associations Code was applicable to this decision.\n\nThe Board had an exchange on the evaluation of the CEO's performance in 2021, and on the score attributed to each of the individual and collective objectives, which were unanimously approved.\n\nIn line with the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board sets the CEO's STI 2021 (payable in 2022) at 150% of her Base Salary, i.e. \u20ac1,875,000. In addition, the Board approved an exceptional grant of \u20ac400,000 payable in LTIs to reward the record results of 2021 and the significant progress in the transformation of the Company.\n\nThe Board congratulates Mrs. I. Kadri on the results achieved in 2021.",

The STI financial objectives will be discussed and approved at a later meeting. '\n\nOn July 27, the procedure was applied in connection with the CEO targets:\n\n- ' Dr. Ilham Kadri is directly concerned by the STI targets since it relates to her remuneration. In accordance with Art. 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations, Dr. Ilham Kadri has therefore declared a conflict of interest within the meaning of that provision.\n\nAs a result, the Board discussed the following in the absence of Dr. Ilham Kadri.\n\nThe Board unanimously confirmed the following targets for the STI 2022 which had been presented during the March 5 meeting as well as the revised 2022 STI sustainability share .\n\nOn September 28, the procedure was applied in connection with a special incentive linked to the completion of the project separating Solvay into two listed companies:\n\n' Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien reported on the discussions of the last Remuneration Committee on the basis of the pre-read documentation.\n\nHe explained that the discussion includes the implementation of the Power of 2 retention and incentive plans, including the individual allocations for ELT members.\n\nDr. Ilham Kadri, being one of the proposed beneficiaries of the retention and incentive plans, declared having a conflict of interest within the meaning of Art. 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations, and decided not to be present for such discussion topic. The auditor has been informed of such conflict of interest.\n\nThe key features as presented and discussed at the Remuneration Committee of September, 14 2022 were summarized:\n\n- \u00b7 The first element, the retention plan is a cash retention bonus with the key aim of retaining key people to (1) drive the Power of 2 project at a time of great personal uncertainty; (2) ensure focus can be maintained and avoid distraction; (3) ensuring business continuity. This element was reviewed in the remuneration committee of March, 8 2022, and the Board of March, 14 2022.\n- \u00b7 The second element, the incentive element, is a share option plan with a value creation performance condition and aims to: (1) incentivize and drive the value creation of the two new companies; (2) recognize exceptional performance; (3) align executive experience with that of shareholders in the establishment of the two new companies.\n\nThe payout of the retention bonus and the possibility to exercise the stock options are subject to several requirements, including performance requirements, as well the specific confirmation of the key features of the retention and incentive plans by the 2023 Ordinary Shareholders Meeting. Such key features will be described in the remuneration report.\n\nHaving discussed the matter, the Board unanimously confirmed the retention and incentive plans and approved the proposed allocations, in accordance with the table set out in the pre-read documentation.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Tiberghien reported on the discussions of the last Nomination Committee on the basis of the pre-read documentation.\n\nGiven that one of the mandate renewal proposals made by the nomination committee concerns Dr. Ilham Kadri, she was absent from the discussions, in/uni00A0accordance with article 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations.\n\nThe mandate of Dr. Ilham Kadri as Chair of the ELT and CEO will expire on January 1, 2023. The Committee recommended to the Board to renew the mandate of Dr. Ilham Kadri as ELT Chair and CEO of the company for a period of two years, ending on January 1, 2025. (...). Having discussed the matter, the Board unanimously decided to renew the mandate of Dr. Ilham Kadri as ELT Chair and CEO for a period of two years, ending on January 1, 2025. '\n\n## 3.1.5. Evaluation\n\nA Board performance evaluation, facilitated by an external party, is undertaken every two to three years, to gather opinions on how the current Board is functioning and identify areas for improvement. A new evaluation was launched by Guberna (Belgian Association for Governance) in/uni00A0Q4 2022. The evaluation focused primarily on the composition, succession planning, preparation and functioning of the Board and its committees, and the interactions between the Board and the ELT. Sustainability, and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) topics were also included in the assessment.\n\nThe action plan resulting from the previous evaluation provided the foundation for the Board's work during the period under review. For example, the level, depth and frequency of engagement between the Board and ELT significantly increased both formally and informally. Furthermore, the creation of a standalone Board ESG Committee assisted in accelerating Solvay's sustainability commitments.\n\nThe formal evaluation exercise, which was conducted in February 2023 with the support of an external party, indicates that the Board of Directors of Solvay has a high added value in its functioning and in the implementation of its roles./uni00A0Suggestions as to further developments, including on diversity of competencies and experiences, are formulated in the evaluation report.",

The program includes a review of the Group's strategy and activities, and the main challenges in terms of growth and competition, a site visit, and a review of finance, research and innovation, human resources management, legal context, corporate governance and compliance topics.\n\nSite visits are part of the Board's Continuous Training Program. They consist of meetings with management and local teams, business presentations and field tours. In September 2022, the full Board visited the Spinetta Marengo site in Italy, where the core business is fluoropolymers, used in electric mobility, aeronautics, resource efficiency, healthcare expansion, automotive and digitalization. The Board also visited the Bollate site in Italy, and various laboratories, including the Battery Lab and H2/uni00A0Lab. They were able to measure the significant footprint of Solvay's research and development activities in the world of materials. ESG topics were also discussed during these site visits.\n\nThe Board is also actively engaged on the topic of sustainability. Every year, a specific session is organized, dedicated to receiving updates on various themes from sustainability teams, so as to better understand the Group's strengths and weaknesses, and to determine the impact of emerging trends on the Group's business and performance. This year's training session covered the evolution of sustainability practices and future requirements, risk management and Solvay's improvement potential.\n\n## 3.2.  Board committees\n\nThe Board has the following permanent committees: Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nominations Committee and ESG Committee. The principles governing the composition, role and missions of the committees, as well as their internal rules, are set out in the Charter.\n\nThe composition of the key committees is regularly reviewed, including whether they meet the expectations of the market and our diverse shareholder base. As we continue to refresh the Board, we also consider adding independent members to our committees. As of today, all key committees (Audit, Nominations and Remuneration) are composed solely of non-executive directors, a majority of which are independent. More importantly, these committees comprise members that have the experience and skills necessary to ensure they deliver on their mandate.\n\nAll mandates will expire in May 2024. There are no changes planned until the project to separate the company is complete.",

The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee\n\nThe ESG Committee was created in 2021 and is continually evaluated. The members of this committee have acquired the necessary skills and expertise through their past experience in areas such as transforming and leading companies toward greater sustainability, human and social aspects, and philanthropy and sponsorship. They are assisted by internal and external experts when necessary.\n\n## Composition:\n\n- \u00b7 The ESG Committee comprises five members, including the CEO and non-executive directors.\n- \u00b7 The majority are independent directors.\n- \u00b7 The secretary is the Group Corporate Secretary.\n\n## Meetings:\n\n- \u00b7 The ESG Committee meets three times per year, with one of these meetings including the full Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Meeting attendance was 100% in 2022.\n\n## Activities:\n\nThe objective of the ESG Committee is:\n\n- \u00b7 to consider the material ESG issues relevant to the Group's business activities;\n- \u00b7 to provide guidance and recommendations to the Board on these issues, including for the implementation and potential review of the Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap and the Group's non-financial reporting; and\n- \u00b7 to be in line with the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), when applicable.\n\nThe ESG Committee oversees an annual review of the Group's ESG policies, progress and effectiveness, taking into account:\n\n- \u00b7 relevant risk and opportunity mapping;\n- \u00b7 the new sustainability developments, and their impact on the Group;\n- \u00b7 the Group's current sustainability performance, and main strengths and challenges; and\n- \u00b7 future priorities, opportunities and challenges related to this.",

When appropriate, the ESG Committee also collaborates with other committees with oversight responsibility for executive remuneration, talent management, compliance and other shared topics.\n\n## 4. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM (ELT)\n\nThe role, responsibilities, composition, procedures and evaluation of the Executive Leadership Team are described in detail in the Charter, which is available on Solvay's corporate website.\n\nTo accelerate our G.R.O.W. transformation, the ELT decided to create an Operational Leadership Team comprised of heads of businesses. They also decided to combine certain businesses and implement additional simplification measures, grouping 17 distinct functions into seven.

        "page_content": "## 5. REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## 5.1.  Year in overview\n\n## An unprecedented performance with new records in Sales, EBITDA and ROCE\n\nIn 2022, we delivered record financial results, despite the Ukraine-related energy crisis, the Zero-Covid policy in China and high levels of inflation. It was also a year that marked a strategic milestone for Solvay, with the announcement of our Power of 2 project, which will see the company split into two new entities, known as EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo.\n\nOur record financial performance resulted from solid volume growth, strong pricing power, disciplined cost and cash management, and continuous deleveraging of our balance sheet. Leadership and management teams were fully mobilized to overcome challenging geo-political and economic conditions, with a collective resolve and focus on meeting demanding objectives.\n\nOur focus was not only on achieving strong results in 2022. Strong cash generation enabled us to increase and accelerate investment to expand our capabilities in high-growing markets, further upgrade the quality of our portfolio and take additional steps to reduce the Group's carbon footprint. Our/uni00A0aim is to ensure that the two new companies we create will be able to use these investments to deliver superior and responsible growth.\n\nWe continued to reinvent the company in 2022, demonstrating resilience, and a spirit of innovation and strength in a very challenging context, by accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to maximize production, working diligently to meet customer needs and driving price increases to maintain margins.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, we achieved record organic EBITDA of \u20ac3,2 Bn, a 28.7% increase compared to 2021. This great achievement was marked by a combination of growth in the majority of markets, improved pricing power in the latter part of the year, and continued discipline and focus on cost reductions. This is the first time in the company's history that we reached \u20ac3 Bn. We generated a record annual/uni00A0free cash flow/uni00A0generation of \u20ac1,094 million/uni00A0reflecting higher profits, margin expansion and working capital discipline, and this is despite a +39% increase in capital investments to \u20ac1,022 million for the year./uni00A0\n\nOur cash discipline throughout the year resulted in Free Cash Flow (FCF) of \u20ac1,1/uni00A0Bn, 15th quarter of positive free cash flow and a class-leading 34% free cash flow conversion.\n\nOur focus on returns also resulted in a record ROCE of 16%, a new record level, versus 11.4% end of 2021 and 8.1% end of 2019.\n\nThese results required clear and bold leadership in an uncertain environment and clearly demonstrate the hard work of Solvay's teams and the real transformation that has occurred over the past three years. These accomplishments would have not been possible without the commitment and determination of Solvay's employees. The results also serve as a great motivator as we move forward with the Power of 2/uni00A0project.\n\nMore details on Solvay's 2022 results and their impact on remuneration are disclosed in the Performance section.\n\n## Achieving sustainable shared value for all\n\nSolvay's vision is to create sustainable shared value for all, by positively impacting our employees and the communities we serve. In 2022, Solvay's full leadership team signed the Solvay Inclusivity Pledge, recognizing that inclusive leaders are essential to creating an environment where everyone feels heard, valued and empowered to be the best version of themselves.\n\nThe first gender pay gap assessment was conducted and published in 2021. We have now set out concrete actions to move forward with our pay equity journey, ensuring that we do this in a gender-neutral way. We created a 'homogeneity index', a new quarterly measure of the diversity of our entities which assesses three dimensions: gender, age and nationality. We also included our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) roadmap within the Solvay One Planet part of the Short Term Incentive.\n\nWe continued our significant commitment, which we began last year, to send 450 women through the A Effect, an external development program designed for women, and we made DEI the topic of the fourth edition of our annual Citizen Day event.\n\nWe also continue to pursue all programs to support and empower employees, such as our Solvay Cares benefits program, which includes a global parental leave policy of 16 weeks for all new parents, and our employee well-being support program. In 2022, the Group also provided mental health support through training provided by qualified experts.\n\nMore details on DEI can be found in section 6.3 Diversity and Inclusion in this report of the extra-financial section.\n\nTo help our employees cope with high inflation, the Executive Leadership Team set aside \u20ac8 million in July 2022 to distribute as an exceptional bonus to employees whose income is proportionally most affected by rising inflation. Our strong performance allowed us to increase this to \u20ac9.5/uni00A0million in September 2022, and we also increased the Global Performance Sharing (GPS) envelope for blue collar, 'non-executive' employees by 36%. In addition, the Solvay Solidarity Fund, which was created in 2020, continues to provide aid for our employees and communities in need.\n\nIn 2022, for the first time in Solvay's history, the Group offered employees the opportunity to become company shareholders. By purchasing shares in Solvay, employees received a free share on joining the scheme and a matched share for every two Solvay shares purchased. The Employee Share Purchase Plan is part of Solvay's employee engagement program. It achieved a participation rate of close to 28%, well above the best in class of 25%. As the company's owners, Solvay's employees will learn to better appreciate the Group's performance and experience the risks and rewards of share ownership.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder engagement and Board responsiveness\n\nAt the last Ordinary General Shareholders Meeting on May 10, 2022, Solvay's new Executive Remuneration Policy was put to a shareholder vote and received support from 95.77% of participating shareholders. This made it the one of the best-supported remuneration policies among BEL/uni00A020 Index members in 2022.\n\nThe remuneration program presented for shareholder vote reflected significant changes made to Solvay's remuneration practices and disclosures. These were made in response to feedback collected from shareholders in 2021 and included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reduced weighting assigned to individual performance criteria for the annual bonus;\n- \u00b7 strengthened focus on our Solvay One Planet performance metrics, by increasing their weighting in incentive plans;\n- \u00b7 increased weighting of performance-based equity to 70% of the total target equity incentive target;\n- \u00b7 a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure, introduced into the long-term incentive program;\n- \u00b7 streamlined maximum award opportunities under the long-term equity incentives, so that they are based on a multiple of salary, rather than a Euro amount, for all ELT members; and\n- \u00b7 stock ownership guidelines for non-executive directors and ELT members.\n\nIn line with Solvay's Purpose of bonding people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress, Solvay's Remuneration Committee is continuously striving to improve and strengthen its governance structures to create value for all Solvay's stakeholders.\n\nAt  the  same  Ordinary  General  Shareholders  Meeting,  Solvay's  Remuneration  Report  received  89.1%  support  from  participating  shareholders. Notwithstanding the fact that this represented a year-on-year increase in the level of shareholder support, and irrespective of the fact that it exceeded levels achieved in the majority of other BEL 20 Index companies, the Remuneration Committee, and the Board as a whole, took additional steps to understand shareholders' and proxy advisors' perspectives so that they could make further improvements.\n\nFollowing an engagement exercise with a dozen of investors - representing about 8.5% of shares - and proxy advisors, and the Remuneration Committee's own research, Solvay determined that reservations about the Remuneration Report largely related to the severance payment made to an outgoing ELT member, which had exceeded certain shareholders' internal limits. Solvay notes that the statutory termination compensation paid to the outgoing ELT member, who had worked with Solvay for close to 35 years, was in accordance with his entitlements under the 1978 Belgian Employment Contract Act and the Remuneration Committee had no flexibility whatsoever to adjust the calculated payment. In fact, to have done anything different would have exposed Solvay to action for not complying with legal obligations.\n\nShareholders and other stakeholders also recommended continued strengthening of disclosures surrounding Solvay's remuneration practices, including the performance measures selected under the short- and long-term incentive plans. The disclosures within this year's Remuneration Report have therefore been extended to accommodate this.\n\nSolvay's Remuneration Committee, and the Board as a whole, will continue to solicit shareholders' and proxy advisors' feedback to ensure that Solvay's approach to remuneration remains aligned with the interests of all stakeholders and evolves as market expectations change./uni00A0\n\n## 5.2.  Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nSolvay SA directors are remunerated, in line with Solvay's Remuneration Policy, with fixed emoluments, the common basis for which is set at the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting. Any addition to this is decided by the Board. The process is based on Article 26 of our articles of association, which states that:\n\n- \u00b7 'Directors shall receive fixed emoluments payable; the Shareholders' Meeting shall determine the amount and terms of payment';\n- \u00b7 'That decision shall stand until another decision is taken';\n- \u00b7 'The Board of Directors shall be authorized to grant Directors with special duties, different from their Director's mandate, fixed emoluments in addition to those provided for in the above paragraph';\n- \u00b7 'Each of the Directors responsible for day-to-day management and ELT Member, are also entitled to variable remuneration determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of their individual results and of the consolidated results of the Solvay Group'.\n\nBoard fees are determined after considering the roles and responsibilities of each director, and the practices of companies of a similar size and international complexity. An assessment of market practice is conducted on a regular basis and the fees are disclosed in the remuneration report each year.",

More specifically, non-executive directors are not entitled to annual bonuses, stock options or performance share units, or to any supplemental pension scheme.\n- \u00b7 Solvay reimburses directors' travel and expenses for meetings related to their Board and Board Committee functions.\n\nThe Board fees have not been increased since 2005.\n\nThe Group provides administrative support, in the form of an office, use of the General Secretariat and a car, to the Chairman of the Board only. The other non-executive directors receive logistical support from the General Secretariat when needed. Solvay also provides customary insurance policies covering the Board of Directors' activities when they are carrying out their duties.\n\nThe new Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM introduced Share Ownership Guidelines for Board members, requiring nonexecutive directors to hold a number of Solvay shares equivalent to 100% of their gross annual fixed board fees. See section/uni00A05.2.2. Share ownership guidelines for the Board.\n\nSolvay acknowledges that the 2020 Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (the 'Code') recommends that a portion of the remuneration paid to Board Members be in shares (Principle 7.6), and is aware that Solvay's Remuneration Policy does not provide for this. The Remuneration Committee considers that the current Remuneration Policy remains relevant and that recent changes regarding the requirement to hold shares hold equivalent merit and achieve a similar outcome.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Committee  regularly  reviews  Solvay's  remuneration  practices,  disclosures  and  market  practices  to  determine  whether  the Remuneration Policy currently in practice remains appropriate. Any changes to the Remuneration Policy regarding the Board's remuneration will be submitted to shareholders and only be implemented following shareholder consent.\n\n## 5.2.2. Share ownership guidelines for the Board\n\nSolvay does not directly award shares to non-executive directors as a form of remuneration. However, to comply with the spirit of principle 7.6 of the 2020 Corporate Governance Code, non-executive directors are required to hold a number of Solvay shares equivalent to 100% of their gross annual fixed board fees. These shares should be held until at least one year after the non-executive director leaves the Board of Directors and, in any case, for at least three years after the shares were acquired. The dividends attached to these shares are paid at the same time as for the other shareholders.",

The strengthened framework of the Remuneration Policy focuses on meritocracy and performance, maximizing returns in a responsible and sustainable way, and the ability of the Group to attract, motivate and retain the best executive talent in alignment with market trends and the best long-term interests of shareholders. These important principles are also reflected in the remuneration policies and programs offered to Solvay employees globally. 0,91 1,13 0,63 0,69 0,86 0,48 24% 42% 34% 24% 42% 34% 0,49 0,62 0,35 0,45 0,56 0,31 24% 42% 34% 0,47 0,59 0,33 1,30 1,56 32% 27% 24% 42% 34%\n\nThe remuneration structure is designed in line with the following principles, which apply both to ELT Members and other senior executives:\n\n- \u00b7 Total remuneration is set at a level that is competitive in the relevant market and sector, in order to attract, retain and motivate the high-caliber talent needed to deliver the Group's strategy and drive business performance.

Use of Market Data\n\nIn alignment with the Remuneration Policy, remuneration of ELT Members is benchmarked against that of a peer group, which Solvay has endeavored to ensure has remained broadly consistent over the years, and remains the same as for the previous reporting period. Solvay's peer group is built around a selection of relevant European chemical and industrial companies whose international operations footprint and model, as well as annual revenues and headcount positions Solvay broadly at the median of the peer group. The Remuneration Committee aims to position Solvay at the market median for all key elements of the package.\n\nThe peer group includes the following companies:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u20ac1,32\n\n\u20ac1,39\n\n42%\n\n24%\n\n34%",

Base remuneration and Benefits\n\n## Fixed base remuneration\n\nFixed base remuneration reflects an individual's experience, skills, duties, responsibilities, contribution and role within the Group. It is reviewed annually and may be adjusted, taking into consideration a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 comparable salaries in appropriate comparator groups;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 changes within the scope of the role;/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 changes in the Group's size and profile;/uni00A0and\n- \u00b7 inflation following legal requirements in different countries./uni00A0\n\nBase remuneration, which does not include the value of any benefits offered to ELT Members, is used to calculate targets for variable remuneration.\n\nDetails of the base remuneration of the CEO and ELT Members are disclosed in sections 5.3.2. and 5.3.4. of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\n## Pension and other benefits\n\nIn pursuit of Solvay's mission, Solvay One Planet and Solvay One Dignity objectives, and in alignment with the Solvay Cares aspirations, benefits are seen as a critical part of Solvay's remuneration package, and overall employee and executive value proposition. Benefits are not dependent on an individual's performance.\n\nIn accordance with Belgian legal requirements, the CEO has a separate contractual agreement, given her self-employed status in Belgium. This includes pension, death-in-service and disability provisions. Other ELT Members that perform their duties on the basis of a work contract are entitled to pension, death-in-service and disability benefits according to the provisions of the plans applicable in their home countries. ELT Members who do not have a work contract receive remuneration payment of management fees only.\n\nOther benefits, such as medical plans, and company cars or car allowances, are also provided, according to local policies. Solvay aims to ensure that the nature and level of these other benefits are in line with median market practice and what is provided to other executives in the Group.",

Short Term Incentive (STI) plan\n\n## Setting STI objectives\n\nObjectives are set by the Board annually for the Group and the CEO. The process takes place at the Board meeting in February of each year. The aim of this objective-setting process is to set targets that are challenging, but realistic. As such, the Board takes into account the 'bottom-up' views and ambitions of the business, but ultimately sets the objectives based on Solvay's longer-term ambitions for growth, the long-term sustainability of the business and the competitiveness of the external market.\n\nSolvay's approach to short-term incentive-linked objectives is to set growth-orientated, stretch goals at the 'target' award level, driving a growth-oriented, pay-for-performance mindset, with top results generating awards commensurate with the performance level, between the 'target' and 'maximum'.\n\n## 2022 Short Term Incentive plan\n\nAs approved at the 2022 Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, the Short Term Incentive plan provides a cash opportunity that is based solely on the achievement of pre-determined annual financial, non-financial and individual objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe target opportunity provided by the STI plan for the CEO is 120% of fixed base remuneration, and up to 70% of fixed base remuneration for other ELT members. The minimum payout is 0% and the maximum is 200% of target STI.\n\nThe 2022 STI plan uses three broad performance categories with the following weightings for all ELT Members:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial Objectives (65% of the STI): Underlying EBITDA organic growth and free cash flow conversion.\n- \u00b7 Solvay One Planet Objectives (15% of the STI): Underpinned by Solvay's G.R.O.W. strategy, Solvay One Planet is structured around the three major categories of climate, resources and better life, and serves as our roadmap toward a sustainable future. Specific KPIs are selected under each major category to measure our performance in ways that are material, quantifiable and relevant to driving long-term value for all stakeholders. More information on Solvay One Planet can be found on our corporate website.\n- \u00b7 Individual Objectives (20% of the STI): Individual performance is measured against predetermined non-financial, quantitative and qualitative objectives. These are defined by the Board for the CEO and then cascaded down to other ELT Members by the CEO. The CEO assesses the achievement of individual objectives by the ELT Members, and this assessment is then/uni00A0reviewed and validated by the Board. The individual performance of the CEO is assessed by the Remuneration Committee, and this is then reviewed and validated by the Board. In line with good governance practices, the CEO is absent from the Remuneration Committee and Board during all discussions relating to CEO pay. Details of the individual performance of the CEO, including the targets set and their achievement, are explained below./uni00A0\n\n## Individual objectives and performance of the CEO for STI calculation\n\nIn the new Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee decided to increase the proportion of the STI allocated to meeting Solvay One Planet and financial objectives set out in Solvay's G.R.O.W. strategy. The weighting assigned to individual performance within the STI plan was therefore reduced from 40% to 20% for the CEO. All ELT Members now have a maximum of 20% of their STI plan subject to individual performance objectives.\n\nThe Board and Remuneration Committee determine these objectives at the beginning of the financial year and track their achievement as part of a review of the CEO's performance during the year.",

The next section provides a breakdown of how the CEO performed against the targets set under the STI plan for the 2022 financial year. As best practice, Solvay will continue to disclose in a separate document, ahead of the Ordinary General Shareholders Meeting, the performance measures and associated weighting of each measure selected under the STI plan to determine the CEO's bonus for the upcoming financial year.\n\nBonuses are subject to malus and clawback provisions, as approved in Solvay's latest Remuneration Policy.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.5.2. Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n\nLong-term incentive grants for the ELT Members were offered according to the new Remuneration Policy approved in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 70% of the annual grant value offered in the form of performance-based restricted share units (PSU); and\n- \u00b7 30% of the award offered in the form of Restricted Share Units (RSU).\n\nIn this new policy and as from 2022, an external measurement of success was introduced to compare performance of the Group to the TSR performance of Stoxx/uni00A0600 index companies, establishing a clear focus for the ELT and a direct link with the value being delivered to shareholders.\n\nIn May 2022, the Board granted a total of 37,647 PSUs and 16,136 RSUs to ELT members. Approximately 370/uni00A0executives and high-potential employees also participated in the Share Option Plan.\n\n## Long Term Incentive award opportunity\n\nThe CEO has an LTI grant target of 150% of fixed base remuneration. The Board can apply discretion between 0% and 150% of the grant value. For all other ELT Members, the grant target value is up to 125% of the fixed based remuneration. Discretion of up to a maximum of 150% of the grant value can be applied.\n\nThe actual annual grant value, within the limits of the Remuneration Policy as explained above, is determined and approved by the Board.\n\n## Performance Share Units and Restricted Share Units\n\nTo align with market practice and simplify the Remuneration Policy, as from 2022 the annual grant value is determined as a percentage of fixed base remuneration, rather than as a fixed Euro amount for all ELT Members. Under the previous Remuneration Policy only the CEO received an award based on a multiple of base remuneration.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also increased the proportion of performance-based remuneration within the LTI program so that it is better aligned with global best practice. More specifically, the new Remuneration Policy increased the weight of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) from 50% to 70% of the annual grant value. The remaining 30% of the annual grant will be delivered in the form of RSUs under the Restricted Shares Plan (RSP), replacing stock options and serving as both a retention tool and a way of encouraging share ownership among executives to better align their interests with shareholders.\n\nThe PSUs and RSUs are granted in the form of conditional shares with vesting tied to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's performance between 2022-2024, based on the performance metrics detailed for the PSUs;\n- \u00b7 on time-based restrictions for the RSUs.\n\nBoth plans are subject to a three-year vesting period.\n\nThe PSUs vest three years from the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the pre-set performance objectives. The opportunity varies from a minimum of zero, if the minimum target is not met, to a maximum payout of 150%, if the maximum target is achieved. In addition, for the vesting of the PSU, a relative performance measure was introduced as from 2022 to compare the performance of the Group to the TSR performance of Stoxx/uni00A0600 index companies, establishing a clear focus within the ELT to create shareholder value. Where the PSU result is above zero, the TSR measure can decrease the/uni00A0PSU outcome by 25% of the/uni00A0PSU result when the TSR is in the lower quartile of the Stoxx 600 index, and increase the PSU result by 25% when the TSR is in the top quartile of the Stoxx 600 index.\n\nThe remaining portion of the LTI grant is in RSUs, where executives receive shares that vest after three years, provided that they remain in employment. RSUs were introduced with the new Remuneration Policy, as the Board considered it to be a more effective retention tool for executives.\n\nEvery year, the Board determines the budget available for distribution and the total volume of PSUs available is subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## PSU features:\n\n- \u00b7 70% of the annual grant is delivered via the Performance Share Plan;\n- \u00b7 the Plan is designed to incentivize and reward the ELT for delivering Solvay's long-term business objectives, and align them with the interests of shareholders; the plan is delivered in a form of shares of Solvay, with\n- \u00b7 the vesting of awards is based on meeting pre-set performance targets;\n- \u00b7 the performance period is three years;\n- \u00b7 an employment condition applies;\n- \u00b7 outcomes range from zero, if the minimum targets are not met, to a maximum of 150% of target, if all plan objectives are achieved;\n- \u00b7 TSR measures can increase or decrease the final PSU award for Executive Leadership Team members by 25%;\n- \u00b7 the plan has malus and clawback provisions as per the remuneration policy;\n- \u00b7 dividends accrue only with respect to vested awards and are paid at the end of the performance period.\n\n## RSU features:\n\n- \u00b7 30% of the annual grant is delivered in the form of RSUs;\n- \u00b7 used as a retention tool, to attract and retain the best executives;\n- \u00b7 always vest with no performance hurdle, after the three-year vesting period, provided employment conditions are met;\n- \u00b7 the award is only linked to the time worked during the three-year period and vests in full;\n- \u00b7 the plan has malus and clawback provisions as per the remuneration policy;\n- \u00b7 dividends accrue only with respect to vested awards and are paid when the shares vest.",

        "page_content": "The Board assesses the achievement of the targets set, based on the audited results of the Group. They may use discretion to re-evaluate the targets in exceptional situations. Where such discretion is applied by the Remuneration Committee, the rationale for the use of such discretion will be disclosed. Additionally, discretion, if used, is subject to the award limit stated under the Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration Committee has not applied such discretion in the recent past to adjust any LTI awards, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## 2019-2021 LTI Performance Share Unit plan performance results\n\nThe results of the PSU grant of 2019 were calculated and paid in June 2022, based on a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2021. The 2021 financial year was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving a lasting impact on all of Solvay's PSU plans that include performance of the Group in 2020. To date, the Board has not revised the PSU plan performance targets or their thresholds in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, demonstrating their prudent approach to using the discretionary power granted to them in the Remuneration Policy.\n\nPerformance against the objectives set in 2019 is summarized below.\n\n| Group Performance  Measured over  three-year period   | Weight   | Threshold  (80% payout)     | Target        | Maximum  (120%  payout)   | Actual  result   | Achievement  compared to target   | Performance  % usedin PSU  calculation   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Sum of underlying EBITDA  growth %                    | 40%      | <15%                        | 20%           | >25%                      | <15%             | 0%                                | 0%                                       |\n| CFROI base point variation                            | 40%      | <25 bp                      | 75bp          | >125 bp                   | <25 bp           | 0%                                | 0%                                       |\n| Greenhouse gas emission reduction (Mt CO 2 )          | 20%      | >0 (increase of  emissions) | -0.5 Mt  CO 2 | > -0.75 Mt  CO 2          | > -0.75 Mt  CO 2 | 120%                              | 24%                                      |\n| Total                                                 | 100%     |                             |               |                           |                  |                                   | 24% out of 100% (max opportunity  120%)  |\n\nThe share price differential (grant share price versus share price at vesting) and the total dividends, taking into account the number of vested units calculated over three years (\u20ac11.35 per unit), resulted in a payout of 24% of the PSU value granted in 2019.\n\nPayouts made in 2022 to the ELT Members relating to the 2019-2021 PSU plan are disclosed in the section below: 5.3.5. Amount of remuneration paid and other benefits granted directly or indirectly to the CEO and other ELT Members.\n\n## Stock options (SOP)\n\nThe historical Stock Option Plan has been replaced by the PSU and RSU plans detailed above. However in-flight plans remain and the rules thereof are reiterated below.\n\nUnder Belgian law, unlike most other jurisdictions, taxes on stock options are due at the time of grant. Solvay, like other Belgian companies, had therefore set no additional performance criteria for determining the vesting of stock options. The options have a vesting period of three full calendar years meaning that options will vest on the first day of the fourth year after the grant year - followed by a four-year exercise period.\n\nThe SOP gives each beneficiary the right to buy Solvay shares at a strike price corresponding to the fair market value of the shares upon grant. Every year, the Board determines the volume of stock options available for distribution, based on an assessment of the economic fair value at grant, using the Black Scholes valuation formula. The total volume of options available is subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## SOP features:\n\n- \u00b7 options are granted at the money (or fair market) value;\n- \u00b7 they become exercisable for the first time three full calendar years after they are granted;\n- \u00b7 they have a maximum term of eight years;\n- \u00b7 they are not transferable inter vivos;\n- \u00b7 the plan includes a bad leaver clause.\n\n## 2022 equity award for Solvay Leadership Team (SLT) members to ensure and recognize the success of our PO2 project\n\nIn 2022, the Group announced our aim to create two distinct, independent, publicly listed industry leaders. This is known as the Power of 2/uni00A0project.\n\nThe successful implementation of this project depends on the performance of Solvay's ELT and key senior executives. For this reason, the Board, following the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, allocated a stock option grant to Solvay Leadership Team members, including the CEO, other executive officers, Global Business Unit (GBU) presidents and heads of key functions.",

        "page_content": "This option grant was made:\n\n- \u00b7 to promote executive commitment to Solvay in relation to the contemplated transformation of the Solvay Group into two independent companies and to incentivize long-term value creation delivered through the transformation of the Group;\n- \u00b7 to incentivize Solvay's leadership team to build two independent companies that over-perform in their categories;\n- \u00b7 to ensure that in setting up and staffing both new companies, negative trade-offs to the detriment of one company and benefit to the other company are avoided, by ensuring that executives have a stake in the mid-term performance of both.\n\nIn light of the PO2/uni00A0project, the Board, and more specifically the Remuneration Committee, evaluated the suitability of the Remuneration Policy approved in 2022 in ensuring that executives remain incentivized and motivated to continue delivering value to all stakeholders in this transition phase. The Board found the Remuneration Policy to be robust, but had to apply discretion to grant the equity award.\n\nThe Board considered it important to send all stakeholders and the executive team a strong message: that Solvay is both ready for the next chapter of growth and value creation for all stakeholders, and capable of navigating the complex PO2/uni00A0project, the success of which depends on maximum dedication from all executives. A number of incentive approaches were considered by the Remuneration Committee. The equity award was the option that aligned best with shareholders' interests, due to its focus on value creation and share price, and its ability to serve as a retention tool, given that executives were required to pay taxes for these options upfront from their own private funds.\n\nA total of 386,867/uni00A0options were granted in October 2022 to 17/uni00A0members of the SLT. All award recipients accepted their option grants in full. The key attributes of the equity award are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stock options are subject to performance conditions - implementation of separation and value creation - and will be forfeited in full if the separation does not occur by 2025.\n- \u00b7 The share price has to increase above \u20ac100/uni00A0for at least 15 days in total, for the options to become exercisable and deliver value. If this criteria is not met, the award lapses.\n- \u00b7 The options may be exercised by beneficiaries between January 1, 2026 and December 31, 2027 inclusive, providing presence and performance criteria are met.\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid at the time of the grant in Belgium and cannot be recouped if the options do not vest or upon voluntary departure, demonstrating executives' commitment and belief in the success of PO2 project and value creation for both companies.\n- \u00b7 The Exercise Price of each option is/uni00A0\u20ac84.34, which was a fair market value at the time of the grant (August 2022).\n- \u00b7 Stock options were determined as a multiple of annual base salary in a range between 50% and 200%, depending on the Board's view of how critical the role is for this transformation.\n\nThe grants approved by the Board under the Remuneration Committee's proposal are subject to a number of requirements that need to be satisfied for payout or exercise of the stock option. This includes confirmation at the Shareholders Meeting for the awards to the Executive Leadership team members.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS AND PSUS - RSUS ALLOTTED IN 2022 TO ELT MEMBERS\n\n| Country   | Name                    | Function                | Number of Options (1)   | Number of PSUs (2)   | Number of RSU (3)   |\n|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Belgium   | Ilham Kadri             | CEO/Chairman of the ELT | 129,418                 | 16,926               | 7,254               |\n| Belgium   | Karim Hajjar            | ELT member              | 42,602                  | 4,836                | 2,073               |\n| Belgium   | Augusto Di Donfrancesco | ELT member              | 42,932                  | 4,836                | 2,073               |\n| Belgium   | Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien        | ELT member              | 23,355                  | 4,018                | 1,722               |\n| Belgium   | Dominique Golsong       | ELT member              | 22,593                  | 3,311                | 1,419               |\n| France    | Marc Chollet            | ELT member              | 22,399                  | 3,720                | 1,595               |\n| Total     |                         |                         | 283,299                 | 37,647               | 16,136              |\n\n- (1) Stock options: fair value calculated based on the closing share price on 14th March 2022, \u20ac20.09 (before Po2 announcement)\n- (2) PSU's share price for May 2022 grant was \u20ac94.09\n- (3) RSU's share price for May 2022 grant was \u20ac94.09\n\nTaxes have been paid upfront for participants based in Belgium and such payments are not recoverable in case of voluntary departure.\n\n## Clawback provisions relating to PSU - RSU plans\n\nSolvay has the right to claim reimbursement of any amounts paid in accordance with the plan from any PSU and RSU plan participant, during a period of three years from the date of the payment, on the basis of erroneous results that were subsequently adjusted or corrected. This clawback clause has not been applied in the past because there have not been any instances where such events occurred.\n\n## Commitment of our ELT Members to the Group with our new Shared Ownership guidelines\n\nTo align executives' interests with those of shareholders, a requirement to build and maintain a shareholding in Solvay equivalent to 150% of fixed base remuneration for the CEO and 100% of fixed base remuneration for other ELT Members was validated in May 2022 under the new Remuneration Policy.",

It does not include: (1) granted or vested value of LTI's during 2022, as SOPs do not represent a value until exercised and PSUs that vest on December/uni00A031 are paid the following year, taking into account the performance of the Group over the vesting period; and (3) any one time payments. Average remuneration of employees is calculated as: 'total wages and direct social benefits' divided by the 'number of employees on a year over year basis for continued operations', as disclosed in the respective sections of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nFollowing the guidance issued by the Belgian Corporate Governance Commission regarding remuneration disclosure, published in November 2020, the ratio of the CEO's pay (highest paid executive in the Group) to that of the lowest paid Solvay employee in Belgium in 2022 is 114x, compared to 90x/uni00A0in 2021 and 108x in 2020. The ratio increased in 2022, due to two main reasons, the first one being the higher short incentive payout related to 2022 due to the exceptional results and accomplishments and the second being the 2019 PSU payout in 2022 (which was the first PSU award payout for the CEO since she joined in 2019).\n\nThe lowest paid employee is defined as a full-time employee in Belgium who has worked for a full year and holds the lowest base salary at year end. The actual total remuneration received by this employee is considered in the calculation of the ratio.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4.  Statements of compliance of remuneration for Chairman and ELT members\n\nThis report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe remuneration packages of Ms. Ilham Kadri, the Chairman of the ELT (or CEO) and the other ELT Members, are in compliance with Article/uni00A07:91 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, which provides that, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary or express approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, at least 25% of the variable remuneration shall be linked to predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least two years, and at least another 25% should be based on predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least three years.\n\nThe remuneration packages are set by the Board, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee. These remuneration packages are also compliant with the Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (2020).\n\nVariable remuneration consisted of an annual incentive based on the performance achieved relative to the Group's economic and sustainable development performance objectives, and on the performance of the individual as measured against a set of pre-determined individual objectives.\n\nELT Members, including the CEO, receive, from 2022, PSUs and RSUs in the form of shares, as explained above. The Board decided to allocate an extraordinary grant of Stock Options following a proposal of the Remuneration Committee in October 2022, in the context of the Group Portfolio Transformation.\n\nThe expenses of the ELT Members, including those of its Chairman (the CEO), are governed by the same rules that apply to all senior management staff, namely the justification of all business expenses, item by item. Private expenses are not reimbursed. In the case of mixed business and private expenses, such as cars, a proportionate rule is applied in the same way as to all management staff in the same position.\n\nAccording to Belgian Law, any changes to our Remuneration Policy need to be submitted to shareholders for approval before implementation.\n\n## 5.5.  Key provisions of Executive Leadership Team Members' contractual relationships with the Company and/or an affiliated company, including provisions relating to remuneration in the event of early departure\n\nELT Members, including the Chairman (or CEO), have directorships in Group subsidiaries as a function of their responsibilities. Where such directorships are compensated, they are included in the amounts given above, regardless of whether the position is deemed to be salaried or undertaken on a selfemployed basis under local legislation.\n\nELT Members will not benefit from any contractual departure indemnity linked to the exercise of their office. In case of early termination, only the legal system applies, except for the CFO, Karim Hajjar, and the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Dominique Golsong 1 . The CFO's employment contract contains a contractual departure indemnity of 12/uni00A0months of his salary after five years of seniority, and a non-competition clause of 12/uni00A0months. The General Counsel and Corporate Secretary's services contract (1) is for a (renewable) fixed term that coincides with the mandate as ELT Member, but which can be terminated with notice or a departure indemnity of three months' base remuneration. A non-competition clause of 12/uni00A0months applies after termination. A non-competition clause of 12/uni00A0months also exists for Herv\u00e9/uni00A0Tiberghien, Marc/uni00A0Chollet and Augusto/uni00A0Di/uni00A0Donfrancesco.\n\nIn the event of a decision to terminate Ms./uni00A0Ilham/uni00A0Kadri's contract, she will be eligible for a contractual indemnity of 18/uni00A0months of her fixed and variable emoluments and all other benefits granted, and a 12/uni00A0month non-compete indemnity equivalent to six months of remuneration computed in the same way as the severance fee due in case of termination by Solvay.\n\nIn the event that Ms. Ilham Kadri resigns, she is subject to a non-competition clause of 12/uni00A0months with no additional remuneration.\n\nThe above report and the decisions made during 2022 about the remuneration of the executives of the Group are aligned with the Remuneration Policy approved at the Annual Shareholders meeting, which took place on May 10, 2022.\n\nThe above is in line with Belgian Corporate Governance Code requirements.",

Roles and responsibilities\n\nSolvay leaders and managers are accountable for ensuring the adequacy of the risk management and internal control framework in their respective Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions.\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risk Management department (IA/RM) organizes internal audit, internal control and risk management activities in a global assurance function to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.\n\nThe Risk Management and Internal Control team provides advice and ensures that leaders address the challenges at stake. It is in charge of setting up and maintaining a comprehensive and consistent system for risk management and internal control across the Group, which is independently reviewed by the Internal Audit team.\n\nTITLE INFOGRAPHIC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe extent to which Solvay is willing to take risks in pursuit of our business strategy and our objective to create shareholder value is defined by a number of qualitative and quantitative expressions of risk appetite, operated through measures such as limits, triggers and indicators. The IA/RM department communicates directly with the Audit Committee, regularly ensuring that the risk appetite of Solvay management is aligned with the risk appetite of the Board.\n\nSolvay has set up an internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- \u00b7 current laws and regulations are respected;\n- \u00b7 policies and objectives set by general management are implemented;\n- \u00b7 financial and extra-financial information is accurate;\n- \u00b7 internal processes are efficient and effective, particularly those contributing to the protection of Solvay's assets.\n\nThe five components of the internal control system and the role of internal audit as an independent assurance provider are described below.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2.  The control environment\n\nAs the foundation of the internal control system, the control environment reflects the tone from the top, thus promoting awareness and compliant behavior among all employees. Its various elements create a clear structure of principles, rules, roles and responsibilities, while demonstrating general management's commitment to compliance.\n\n- \u00b7 The Code of Business Integrity is available on Solvay's website. It refers to underlying policies and procedures. Employees regularly receive training on the Code. More information can be found in the chapter on Corporate Governance and the Extra-financial section of this report.\n- \u00b7 An Ethics Hotline, managed by a third party, enables employees to report potential Code of Business Integrity violations if they cannot go through their managers or through the compliance organization, or if they wish to remain anonymous. More information can be found in the Extra-financial section of this report.\n- \u00b7 Standardized processes and controls, including delegations of authority and signature rules, as well as the application of the segregation of duties principle, are in place for financial and non-financial activities.\n\n## 6.3.  The risk assessment process\n\nThe risk management process takes into account the organization's strategic objectives and is structured into the following phases:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk analysis (identification and evaluation), risk assessment and decision on how to manage the critical risks.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of mitigation plans with risk owners accountable for delivery.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of risk mitigation plans for adequacy and effectiveness.\n\nOur approach to designing internal controls for major processes includes a risk assessment step defining which key control objectives to tackle. In/uni00A0particular, this is the case for processes at subsidiary, shared services, GBU or corporate level, leading to the production of reliable financial reporting.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the/uni00A0CEO and all other members of the Board once a year to discuss the major risks facing the Group. During the year, the Audit Committee systematically reviews progress and regularly invites the relevant leaders and risk owners to provide overviews of their risk assessments and progress on mitigating actions. In accordance with the defined Group risks, topics such as industrial safety, physical security, cybersecurity, ESGrelated subjects, or ethics and compliance matters are addressed.\n\nMore information on Enterprise Risk Management, including a description of the Group's main risks and the actions taken to avoid or mitigate them, can/uni00A0be found in the Risk Management section of this report.\n\n## 6.4.  Control activities\n\nSolvay uses a systematic approach to designing and implementing control activities for the most relevant Solvay processes.\n\nAfter the risk analysis and risk assessment phase, the controls are designed and described by the corporate process owners with the support of the Risk Management team. The descriptions of the controls are used as a reference for the internal control assessment and roll-out across the Group.\n\nAt each level of the Group (corporate, shared services platforms and GBUs), the manager in charge of the process is responsible for the control execution.\n\nAgile internal control governance has been set up under the/uni00A0CFO's sponsorship: corporate process owners and GBU representatives (process risk coordinators) are part of a network that aims to promote an internal control system tailored to the risks of each GBU.\n\nSolvay implements policies and processes applicable to all employees in the following domains: management control, financing and cash flow; financial control; financial communication; tax and insurance policies. Control activities are defined for all of these financial processes and in major cross-Group projects, like acquisitions and divestitures. Furthermore, an online Financial Reporting Guide explains how the IFRS rules should be applied throughout the Group.\n\nFinancial elements are consolidated monthly and analyzed at every level of responsibility in the Company, including Solvay Business Services, the finance director of the entity, Group accounting and reporting, and the Executive Leadership Team. Elements are analyzed using various methods, such as a variance analysis, plausibility and consistency checks, ratio analysis and comparison with forecasts.\n\nIn addition to the monthly reporting analysis prepared by the Group Controlling teams, the Executive Leadership Team thoroughly reviews GBU performance every quarter in the context of business forecast reviews.\n\n## 6.5.  Internal control monitoring\n\nThe Audit Committee is in charge of monitoring the effectiveness of internal control systems. It supervises the work of internal audit and risk management relating to financial, operational and compliance monitoring. It is kept informed of the scope, programs and results of internal control testing, internal control self-assessments, and internal audit work. It also verifies that audit recommendations are properly implemented. The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are detailed in the Corporate Governance Charter. For additional information on the work of internal audit see section/uni00A06.7 below.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance department coordinates investigations of potential Code of Business Integrity infringements.",

A large majority of Group operations are supported by a small number of integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Financial consolidation is supported by a dedicated tool.\n\nAll financial reporting procedures and internal controls ensure that all material information disclosed by Solvay to our investors, creditors and regulators is accurate, transparent and timely, and that it fairly represents the Group's most relevant developments, financial fundamentals and performance.\n\nThe Group Accounting and Reporting department circulates detailed written instructions to all financial actors involved before each quarterly closing.\n\nThe publication of the quarterly financial results is subject to various checks and validation:\n\n- \u00b7 The Investor Relations team designs, develops and issues messages and information about the Group with the needs of financial markets in mind. It does so under the supervision and control of the Executive Leadership Team.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee ensures that financial statements and communications by the Company and the Group conform to generally accepted accounting principles (IFRS for the Group, Belgian accounting law for the Company).\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors approves the consolidated periodic financial statements and those of Solvay SA (quarterly, semiannual and annual) and all related communications.\n\n## 6.7.  Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit team provides risk-based, independent and objective assurance to enhance and protect the organization's value. It uses a systematic and methodological approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal control processes and procedures, helping the organization accomplish its objectives.\n\nThe team performs internal audit assignments across the entire Group on the basis of its Audit Charter and the risk-based annual internal audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. The audit plan takes into consideration internal and external data, risk factors and benchmarks. It includes both entitylevel audits and transversal, Group-wide assignments to address the Group's main risks, which are identified as part of the enterprise risk management process. All the consolidated entities within the Group are inspected by internal audit at least every five years.\n\nThe assignments are scoped, planned and defined on the basis of a risk analysis - due diligence focuses on the areas perceived as having the highest risks. Internal audit recommendations are implemented by management. The implementation status is monitored by the Internal Audit team and reported to management and the Audit Committee on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2022, the Internal Audit team conducted 35/uni00A0assignments across all Solvay regions relating to the efficiency of operations and internal controls, as well as to governance and compliance, ESG, safety of operations, information security and value protection topics.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management reports to the Chief Financial Officer and maintains reporting relationships with the Chair of the Audit Committee and the CEO. She attends all Audit Committee meetings and periodically presents an activity report summarizing audit missions performed, the follow-up of recommendations and the annual audit program. She has direct access at all times to the Chair of the Audit Committee and the CEO.",

EXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nThe audit of the Company's financial situation, financial statements, extra-financial statements and the conformity of these statements - and the entries to be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with the Code of Companies and Associations and the bylaws - are entrusted to one or more auditors. These are appointed at the Shareholders Meeting and chosen from among the members, either natural or legal persons, of the Belgian Institute of Company Auditors.\n\nThe responsibilities and powers of the auditor(s) are set by law.\n\n- \u00b7 The Shareholders Meeting sets the number of auditors and their emoluments in accordance with the law. Auditors are also entitled to reimbursement of their travel expenses for auditing the Company's sites and administrative offices.\n- \u00b7 The Shareholders Meeting may also appoint one or more alternate auditors. Auditors are appointed for three-year renewable terms, which cannot be revoked by the Shareholders Meeting without good reason.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditor with regard to the:\n- -content, quality and insights provided in key external auditor plans and reports, in particular those summarizing audit work performed on risks identified by the Company;\n- -engagement with the external auditor during Committee meetings;\n- -robustness of the external auditor in their handling of key accounting principles;\n- -provision of non-audit services.\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022, professional services were performed by/uni00A0Ernst and Young R\u00e9viseurs d'Entreprises SRL, duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Belgium, whose registered office is at De Kleetlaan, 2, B-1831 Diegem, Belgium, registered in the register of legal entities of Brussels under business registration number/uni00A00446.334.711 and their respective affiliates.\n\nThe yearly 2022 audit fees for Solvay SA were set at \u20ac1.3/uni00A0 million. They include the audit of the statutory and consolidated accounts of Solvay SA. Additional audit fees for Solvay affiliates in 2022 amount to \u20ac3.8/uni00A0million.

ITEMS TO BE DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 34 OF THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE OF NOVEMBER 14, 2007\n\nAccording to Article/uni00A034 of the Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 2007, the Company hereby discloses the following items:\n\n## 8.1.  Capital structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the capital of the Company amounted to/uni00A0\u20ac1,588,146,240, represented by 105,876,416/uni00A0ordinary shares with no designated par value, fully paid up.\n\nAll Solvay shares are entitled to the same rights. There are no different classes of shares.\n\n## 8.2.  Transfer of shares and shareholders' arrangements\n\nSolvay's articles of association do not contain any restriction on the transfer of shares.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there are no agreements among shareholders relating to the Company that may result in restrictions on the transferability of the Company's shares, or the exercise of voting rights. However, the Company has been informed that certain individual shareholders who hold shares directly in Solvay may decide to consult one another when questions of particular strategic importance are submitted by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders Meeting. Each of these shareholders, however, remains free to vote as he or she chooses. None of these individuals, either individually or in concert with others, reaches the initial 3% transparency notification threshold.\n\nSolvay is not aware of any other voting agreements among our shareholders or of the existence of a concert between our shareholders.\n\n## 8.3.  Holders of securities with special control rights\n\nThere are no such securities.",

Control mechanism of any employee share scheme where the control rights are not exercised directly by the employees\n\nThere is no employee share scheme with such a mechanism.\n\n## 8.5.  Restrictions on the exercise of voting rights\n\nEach Solvay share entitles holders to exercise one vote at Shareholder Meetings.\n\nArticle 10 of the Company's articles of association provides that the exercise of voting rights and other rights attached to shares that are jointly owned, or of which the usufruct and bare ownership rights have been separated or are pledged, are suspended pending the appointment of a single representative to exercise the rights attached to the shares.\n\nThe voting rights attached to the shares in Solvay held by Solvay Stock Option Management, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the company, are, as a matter of law, suspended.\n\n## 8.6.  Appointment, renewal, resignation and dismissal of directors\n\nThe articles of association of the Company provide that the Company is to be managed by a Board of Directors composed of no less than five members, their number being determined by the Shareholders Meeting (Article 12). Directors are, in principle, appointed by the Shareholders Meeting for four years, and may be reappointed.\n\nThe Board of Directors submits directors' appointments, renewals, resignations or dismissals to the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting for approval. It/uni00A0also invites such Shareholder Meetings to vote on the independence of the directors fulfilling the related criteria, having first sought the advice of the Nominations Committee, whose mission is to define and assess the profile of any new candidate using its criteria for appointment and for specific competences.\n\nThe Ordinary Shareholders Meeting decides on proposals made by the Board of Directors on this matter by a simple majority.\n\nIf a directorship becomes vacant during a term of office, the Board of Directors may appoint a new member, subject to ratification at the next Ordinary Shareholders Meeting.\n\n## 8.7.  Amendment of Solvay's articles of association\n\nAmendments to the Company's articles of association must be submitted as a resolution to the Shareholders Meeting, at which at least 50% of the share capital of Solvay must be present or represented. In principle, amendments must be passed by a 75% majority of the votes cast.\n\nIf the attendance quorum is not met at the first Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting, a second Shareholders Meeting may be convened and will take a decision without any attendance quorum requirement.\n\nFor certain other matters, such as amendment of the purpose of the Company, higher voting majorities may apply.\n\n## 8.8.  Powers of the Board of Directors\n\n## 8.8.1. Powers of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is the highest governing body of the Company.\n\nIt is entrusted with all the powers that are not reserved, by articles of association, to the Shareholders Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors has kept responsibility for certain key areas and has delegated the remainder of its powers to an Executive Leadership Team (further detailed in the Charter).\n\nIn all matters for which it has exclusive responsibility, the Board of Directors works in close cooperation with the Executive Leadership Team, which, in/uni00A0particular, is responsible for preparing most of the proposals for decisions made by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 8.8.2. The Board's authorizations to issue and buy back shares and increase the capital\n\nThe Shareholders Meeting of May 12, 2020 authorized the Board of Directors to acquire Solvay shares under the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 The par value of the acquired shares, including those held in treasury and those acquired by direct subsidiaries, may not exceed 10% of the capital.\n- \u00b7 Any purchase to be made at a unit price that may not be (i) more than 10% lower than the lowest price of the last 20/uni00A0quotations preceding the transaction; and (ii) more than 10% higher than the highest price of the last 20/uni00A0quotations preceding the transaction, it being understood that the price shall also comply with the requirements of Article/uni00A07:215 of the BCCA and Articles/uni00A08:2 and following of the Royal Decree implementing the BCCA.\n- \u00b7 This authorization is valid for a duration of five years, as from June 5, 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nIn a context of elevated global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, increasingly volatile market cycles and heightened sensitivity and expectations related to climate change and sustainability, we believe that effectively monitoring and managing risks is key to achieving Solvay's strategic objectives.\n\n## 1. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nValue can be created when risk is well understood and managed. Anticipating, mitigating, measuring and monitoring risks is as important to Solvay as the related activity of identifying, managing and optimizing opportunities. The extensive risk-related processes and provisions that we apply with everyone from the Board of Directors and front-line workers to supply chain partners and customers demonstrates this. These processes are outlined below.\n\n## 1.1.  Risk analysis and decision on how to manage critical risks\n\nWe analyze risks in three ways. First, we establish their level of priority for Solvay, which means categorizing them as 'main risks' (most critical), 'emerging risks' or 'other risks'. Second, we identify in which area the risk would have the most impact: the environment, people, economic or reputation. And third, we classify risks according to their time horizon: short term (up to one year); medium term (more than one year and less than five); and long term (more than five years).\n\nIn accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the EU Taxonomy frameworks, we also assess and categorize our main risks as 'Environmental (E)', 'Social (S)', or 'Governance (G)', where applicable.\n\n## 1.2.  Risk management in action\n\nSolvay's Enterprise Risk Management methodology, which is inspired by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) principles, requires our Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions - and the Group as a whole - to prioritize risks, develop and deliver on mitigation plans, and continually scan the environment to assess whether risks and exposures are changing and test whether priorities and plans remain appropriate. This process is closely followed by the Risk Management team, with systematically recorded assessments enabling us to monitor decisions and measure actions and progress.\n\nThe process we use is regularly adjusted, in order to constantly improve the identification and classification of risks. In 2022, we introduced a more systematic classification process to help us integrate ESG risks into our Enterprise Risk Management methodology, by establishing a catalog of ESG risk categories. This helps us identify and systematically assess these risks.\n\nCritical risks for the Group are closely and systematically monitored by the Group Risk Committee, which ensures that these risks are assessed for materiality and are adequately addressed. The Committee is composed of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), establishing a direct link between the Group's strategy and the risk management process, the Group General Manager for Research and Innovation (R&I), the Chief Sustainability and Government Affairs Officer, and the Head of Investor Relations. Group Risk Committee meetings are facilitated by the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management.\n\n## Business and Function leaders integrate risk management into decision making to support delivery of objectives\n\nLeaders of GBUs and Functions are responsible for identifying, monitoring and managing the key risks in their domains. Risk management is embedded in the day-to-day operations of each entity, and operational managers are expected to anticipate and react rapidly when circumstances change. Each GBU formally presents their risk matrix, and the follow-up actions needed to mitigate any critical risks, to the ELT.\n\n## Group risks are overseen at Executive Leadership Team level\n\nGroup-level risks are managed and monitored at the top level. The Senior Leadership Team contributes to identifying risks, the Group Risk Committee contributes to assessing risks and the ELT members contribute to risk sponsorship, treatment and response. Board Members also provide independent input, contributing their broad expertise. Additional input may be provided by the Corporate Risk Management Department, which scans external sources, such as the World Economic Forum Global Risks report, the Risk in Focus report from the ECIIA1, the AXA Future risks report or the Economist Intelligence Unit Risk Outlook, for relevant information. In principle, this input is reviewed and validated by the ELT once a year, but more frequent updates are prepared and reviewed when necessary. This has been the case following the significant impact on energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine, for example.",

The mitigation efforts described do not guarantee that risks will not materialize or impact the Group, but they show how we proactively manage our exposure to risk.\n\n## RISK CORRELATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk of different categories are often inter-connected, and these correlations are identified during the risk management exercises at GBU and Group level.\n\nUsing such correlation analysis, it is possible to obtain a wider view of the potential consequences, and thus of the impacts of the risks, as well as having a better grasp of the causes of the risks, and design more adequate mitigation strategies.\n\nThe chart above displays the correlation between the most relevant risks as presented in the following section of the annual report.\n\n## Risk categories\n\n- Climate risks\n- Compliance and business integrity\n\n## 2.1.  Security\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.1.1. Risk description\n\nCertain security threats can have negative consequences for our business. These include terrorism, crime, violence, vandalism, theft and cyberattacks, which impact employees or other stakeholders, sites, assets, critical information or intellectual property.\n\nSolvay is exposed to physical security risks because it has 62 high-risk operations (high Seveso level, process safety management (PSM) covered). A/uni00A0 number of our products, if mishandled, can cause severe damage. For more information on this, see the Extra-financial statements section of the report: 6.7 hazardous materials.\n\nWe also have sites located in countries where security concerns are rated high by SOS international. One hundred and fourteen industrial, and 27/uni00A0administrative and R&I sites have undergone a Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment (SVSA) and only one R&I site has been assessed as having the highest level of security risk - Level 1 - since the previous SVSA.\n\nSolvay's exposure to cyber risk, as for most major companies, stems from our extensive use of information and communication technologies and the gradually increasing automation level of our sites. Like most multinationals, Solvay experiences cyber incidents and actively responds to those incidents to limit the impact. The Solvay management team is not aware of any incident that would have significant consequences for our financial statements or our business.\n\n- Financial risks\n- Risks on operations\n- Market and growth\n\nEnvironment\n\nMain risk",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSolvay has a risk-based security approach to protecting sites, information, and people.\n\n- \u00b7 A Chief Security Officer (CSO) coordinates all security activities globally in order to ensure efficient security risk mitigation. A Chief Information Security Officer (CIO), reporting to the Chief Security Officer, coordinates all related information security activities.\n\nThree governance bodies lead the security risk management effort:\n\n- \u00b7 a Security Board, chaired by the CEO, which provides strategic direction for the Group's security risk mitigation;\n- \u00b7 a Cyber Security Leadership Committee, chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, which oversees all security activities and provides budget and priority recommendations to the Security Board;\n- \u00b7 a Security Coordination Working Group, chaired by the Chief Security Officer, which runs a continuous security threat monitoring program and an optimized security program for the Group.\n\nSolvay management provides updates on information security to the Board at least once a year and even more frequently to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Cyber security program\n\nThe three governance bodies leading the security risk management effort also supervise our cyber security program, which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of assessments conducted by external experts;\n- \u00b7 the use of penetration tests and internal phishing simulations;\n- \u00b7 substantial training for all Solvay Business Services and Digital Technology (DT) professionals, and mandatory security training for all employees;\n- \u00b7 the regular publication of cybersecurity tips to increase employee awareness;\n- \u00b7 some significant improvements in security posture, which have been achieved by deploying enhanced security technology across the network. This includes controls such as endpoint detection and response, multi-factor authentication, immutable back-ups and a stronger demilitarized zone (DMZ).\n\nA significant cyber-attack could negatively impact Solvay in many ways, including people, operations and results, as well as know-how and intellectual property. We will therefore continue to solidify our cyber defenses so that we are able to manage the evolving cyber threat landscape.\n\n## Insurance\n\nSolvay is insured up to \u20ac150/uni00A0million per claim against the potential financial impact of a cyberattack. This insurance covers damage to assets, business interruption, ransomware and third party liability in case of loss of third party confidential information. The insurance market is insufficient today to provide the full coverage Solvay needs. Solvay has therefore co-created a Mutual of Cyber Insurance (MIRIS) in collaboration with several other Groups, which will start providing coverage to its members in 2023.\n\n## 2.1.3. Main events in 2022\n\nOur Security Risk Management process and tool were completely reshaped in 2022.\n\nAll security risks - cyber, physical and personnel - are now managed in a specific register that allows us to better follow up on decisions, risk ownership and mitigation actions.\n\nA team of two full-time employees is responsible for maintaining the register, following up with the risk owners and improving the process.\n\nA Security Risk Operational Committee is held every two weeks, where the risk owners and security stakeholders, including the CSO and the CIO, review the new risks and decide on how to address them.\n\n## 2.2.  Environmental impact and controversies\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1. Risk description\n\nSolvay's activities impact the environment through:\n\n- \u00b7 Our use of raw materials based on fossil or non-renewable resources and our consumption of energy.\n- \u00b7 Our access to scarce resources, including water.\n- \u00b7 Our management of waste, by-products, emissions and effluents.\n\nSolvay manages or remediates historical soil contamination at all sites for which we are responsible, including divested or discontinued operations, ensuring/uni00A0 continuous compliance/uni00A0 with the applicable/uni00A0 environmental legislation. More information can be found in the Extra-financial section of the Annual Integrated Report.\n\nThese impacts on the environment, in turn, create the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenges and expenses related to meeting increasingly strict regulatory standards and changing customer expectations, standards and purchasing decisions.\n- \u00b7 Changes in investor sentiment and preferences as a result of the changing investor environment.\n- \u00b7 Impact on our ability to recruit employees due to negative public perceptions of environmental issues.",

It is chaired by the Chief Operating and Transformation Officer, and addresses all environmental topics, including remediation, operations and potential risks. Prevention and mitigation activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Careful monitoring and management of sites with a history of soil contamination by a dedicated expert team. We follow up on about 300/uni00A0locations across the world.\n- \u00b7 Rolling out a risk characterization approach at every affected site, when relevant.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory monitoring to proactively assess and address upcoming changes in legislation.\n- \u00b7 Our Group strategy for managing chemicals of concern and developing alternatives with a reduced human and environmental impact, or phasing them out completely.\n\nWe have also implemented a comprehensive program to reduce workplace chemical exposure using:\n\n- -chemical risk assessments and risk-based medical surveillance, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies;\n- -pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans;\n- -human biomonitoring, when warranted;\n- -improving and adapting working conditions;\n- -promoting general physical and mental health; and\n- -setting more conservative in-house exposure limits for critical substances.\n\nWe regularly review, and update, standards governing discharge from plants and we use our Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) tool to help identify substances that can deliver the needed results but with a more limited environmental impact. We revise our materiality analysis on a yearly basis to align it with evolving stakeholder expectations, including environmental impacts.\n\nSolvay is insured up to \u20ac200 million per claim and in the annual aggregate for unknown gradual pollution, and sudden and accidental pollution. Coverage includes defense costs, clean-up costs and third party liability\n\n## 2.2.3. Main actions in 2022\n\nWe continued to execute our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap in 2022, which includes programs to:\n\n- \u00b7 identify substances of concern and the develop alternatives, with a focus on 30/uni00A0priority substances;\n- \u00b7 Carbon neutrality ambition underway, with 59/uni00A0energy transition projects and more than 60/uni00A0waste projects;\n- \u00b7 focus on improving our investment portfolio with regard to water consumption, to meet specific targets by 2025;\n- \u00b7 systematically collect fines and settlements received at our sites and quarterly reporting to the ELT;\n- \u00b7 approve sustainable investment projects using a Solvay One Planet profile review;\n- \u00b7 identify and launch R&I projects that tackle potential risks;\n- \u00b7 reduce our pressure on biodiversity by 30% by 2030, which includes assessing our impact on climate change, terrestrial acidification, water eutrophication and marine ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 identify the Solvay sites most at risk of drought and draft roadmaps for eight priority sites;\n- \u00b7 launch the Star Factory program, which includes a sustainability pillar.\n\n## 2.3.  Compliance and business integrity\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.3.1. Risk description\n\nSolvay management, in alignment with the Board, adopts a zero-tolerance approach in relation to non-compliance toward its Compliance and Business Integrity policy. Solvay's activities require that the following risk categories - among others - be considered in relation to compliance and business integrity:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which Solvay operates.\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, including:\n- -intentional misstatements;\n- -corruption, misappropriation;\n- -by-passing corporate controls, and;\n- \u00b7 Human rights violations.\n- \u00b7 Failure to implement good governance in a joint venture.\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with chemical product usage standards, such as:\n- -inappropriate use of a Solvay product by Solvay personnel or customers, which can lead to adverse health and environmental impacts, property damage and resulting litigation;\n- -production of faulty products, which can result in exposure to liability for injury, health impairment and damage, or product recalls. Product liability risk is generally higher for products used in medical devices, healthcare, food contact and feed applications, and sensitive applications in general;",

There are a lot of regulatory activities worldwide, in particular, we are closely monitoring the upcoming European Union Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) regulatory framework, including its possible impact on our business and operations and potential opportunities stemming from it. The US Administration is also developing a stricter regulatory framework for chemicals, as well as a framework relating to Environmental Justice.\n\n## 2.3.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, policies and procedures\n\nOur Code of Business Integrity includes a wide range of topics, among which those listed above. It applies to all employees and majority-owned joint venture partners. Our Supplier Code of Business Integrity applies to suppliers.\n\nWe introduced training courses which all employees are required to take and to pass. We require that all employees sign an annual acknowledgement that they have read the Code and that they have nothing to report. We have created several training courses and increased awareness through a communication campaign to address specific behavioral risks. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 anti-bribery and anti-corruption;\n- \u00b7 anti-competitive activity;\n- \u00b7 confidential and proprietary information;\n- \u00b7 conflict of interest;\n- \u00b7 reporting non-compliance with human rights in business policy;\n- \u00b7 use of a gifts and entertainment tracking system;\n- \u00b7 use of third-party reporting hotlines and a Group-wide 'Speak Up' program to report non-compliance.\n\nBefore entering into a business relationship, our suppliers are required to sign our Supplier Code of Business Integrity and commit to its principles.\n\nIn addition, we are increasing our oversight on third parties and suppliers in the field of human rights, anti-bribery and corruption and environmental breaches through proactive screening. Human rights has now been integrated in our Ethics Helpline as a matter type and is also open to the employees of our suppliers.\n\n## Chemical product usage\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay Safety Data Sheets (SDS) ensure harmonized content by implementing a common worldwide SAP system for the Group. This SAP system has now been fully implemented across the company.\n- \u00b7 SDS are constantly maintained for all products and are distributed worldwide to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local language. Our GBUs ensure that SDS are revised at least once every three years for all the products they sell.\n- \u00b7 All GBUs perform an annual inventory of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) - defined by Solvay - in the products they sell. A risk assessment and analysis of any available safer alternatives is being performed for each SVHC identified in the inventory. There is also the phase out on top of the analysis of safer alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Recall procedures are developed and deployed as prescribed by the product stewardship programs.\n- \u00b7 Insurance reduces the financial impact of a product liability risk, including for first-party and third-party product recalls.\n\n## 2.3.3. Main actions in 2022\n\n## Business Integrity\n\nMandatory annual training and certification ensures all Solvay employees know our Code of Business Integrity. We measure performance not only by what people deliver, but also on how they deliver, in line with our policies and values./uni00A0\n\nIn 2022 our training focused on protecting a culture of integrity at Solvay, on speaking up and listening, on non-retaliation, on data privacy, and on gifts, entertainment and charitable donations. All employees are required to take the training and to certify that they have read the Code of Business Integrity and will apply it. Last year we also introduced an additional compliance certification for site leaders as they play a key role in maintaining a culture of compliance and integrity at their site./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nA communication campaign was launched to increase awareness about speaking up and raising concerns when people notice a potential breach of our Code of Business Integrity, without fear of retaliation. Our Ethics Helpline was upgraded and made more accessible in 2022, ensuring that incidents can be easily reported and investigated when necessary. Speak Up was also part of the annual mandatory training for all our employees, and we raised awareness amongst employees that they can speak up about the full spectrum of/uni00A0topics referenced in the Code of Business Integrity. This resulted in an increase of reported incidents as reflected in the overview and increased our ability to detect, identify and address issues and risks. The increase in reported incidents does not imply that there were more incidents in 2022 than before, but shows that employees reach out more to report potential breaches, enabling us to investigate and address those breaches, identify root causes, adapt processes or take disciplinary actions when necessary./uni00A0\n\nNew topics such as human rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion were added to our Ethics Helpline. To tackle human rights and environmental impacts across our upstream value chains, Solvay developed an ESG risk management approach for our supply chain in 2022. It provides a systematic approach for identifying risks and assessing their severity in more than 60 upstream value chains, and triggers risk mitigation action plans./uni00A0 The Ethics Helpline is also open to employees of third parties to report suspected violations of laws, regulations or policies.",

All GBUs use this process, which involves prioritizing the required risk assessments in the product portfolio and carrying out risk assessments for the most sensitive product applications.\n\nMore information on this can be found in the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 6.7 Hazardous materials\n\n## 2.4.  Operations safety\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TERM TREND: STABLE\n\n## 2.4.1. Risk description\n\nThe safety of our people is a priority for Solvay, as is specified in our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap. A major accident - whether occupational, process or transport related - that is linked to our internal or outsourced activities may cause human, environmental or asset damages, lead to significant exposure or cause injuries or fatalities. Solvay's industrial sites, like most industrial operations, carry out high pressure and high temperature processes. We also use chemical substances that have risks associated with their chemical composition.\n\nFor more information about Solvay's management approach, see the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 6.1 Employee Health and Safety, 6.8 Critical incident risk management (process safety), 6.7 Hazardous materials.\n\nWe have identified four major operational risks:\n\n- \u00b7 an occupational safety incident which results in a fatality or irreversible (life-altering) injury;\n- \u00b7 a severe process safety incident which results in fatalities, irreversible injuries, environmental harm, and/or loss of physical assets;\n- \u00b7 chronic exposure to occupational agents - chemical, physical, biological or psychological - known to cause work-related disease;\n- \u00b7 a severe transport accident in connection with hazardous chemical transportation which results in irreversible injuries, fatalities or environmental damages.\n\n## 2.4.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSolvay issued a new set of Minimum Requirements to create a shared understanding and approach to mitigating major risks. As part of this approach, we also introduced a new way of working, including a more collaborative and supportive approach to health, safety and the environment (HSE) across the Group.\n\nOur HSE strategy is based on the following four levers:\n\n- \u00b7 Culture: promoting a culture of safety for all employees and contractors.\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement: utilizing networking, best practice, common methods and tools, Solvay HSE Minimum Requirements, external monitoring and benchmarking to improve our HSE performance. Sites are audited on Group HSE procedures at least once every five years, but currently closer to three years on average.\n- \u00b7 Competency: ensuring all employees have the right level of knowledge and skills to put in place the HSE Minimum Requirements, starting with those working in key positions.\n- \u00b7 Compliance: detecting and mitigating regulatory and non-regulatory compliance issues, with a focus on priority risks, both in our operations and commercialized products.\n\n## Occupational safety\n\nSolvay has consistently prioritized occupational safety. Our efforts to create a safety culture where all employees work together and care for one another are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay's Safety Excellence Plan, which involves and engages all Solvay employees. It includes activities such as Safety Days, Leadership Safety Visits, Behavior-Based Safety programs, Safety dialogues and Safety Culture training.\n- \u00b7 The Solvay HSE Minimum Requirements for the Solvay Life Saving Rules (SLSR).\n- \u00b7 The Creating Safety program for leadership teams, aimed at changing mindsets and behavior.\n- \u00b7 A monthly review of occupational safety results by the relevant GBUs and at the Executive Leadership Team level.\n\n## Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Health\n\nSolvay has implemented a comprehensive approach to reducing risks in the workplace. Our approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 risk assessments and risk-based medical surveillance, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, with a focus on chemicals;\n- \u00b7 pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans;\n- \u00b7 human biomonitoring, when warranted;\n- \u00b7 improving and adapting working conditions;\n- \u00b7 deployment of a well-being at work program;\n- \u00b7 promoting general physical and mental health;\n- \u00b7 setting more conservative in-house exposure limits for critical substances.",

This, in turn, could cause business losses, undervaluation and difficulties in attracting long-term investors. The possible risks to Solvay that we have identified are as follows:\n\n## A - Transition risks:\n\nSolvay's energy mix, which uses coal, our raw materials, which include petrochemicals, and our end markets, which include the automotive, aerospace, and building and construction industries, means that we are exposed to risks and opportunities as part of the energy transition. This transition risk includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Policies and legal context: regulations and actions to limit CO 2 emissions, such as increasing carbon taxes, barring internal combustion engines, mandating the use of certain fuel types and tightening environmental standards.\n- \u00b7 Technology: unsuccessful investment in new, lower-emission technologies.\n- \u00b7 Markets: failure to adapt to changing customer behavior.\n- \u00b7 Financial: inability to cope with the influence of climate change on investors' and lenders' decisions.\n- \u00b7 Changed climate: failing to adequately anticipate the impact of upcoming changes on industrial operations and in the value chain or the tightening of environmental standards.\n- \u00b7 Reputation: negative stakeholder attitudes caused by failing to address stakeholder climate change concerns effectively.\n\n## B - Physical risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Sites in water scarcity regions\n- \u00b7 Sites in flood zones\n\nMore information can be found in the extra-financial section 3.8.

Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Progressing towards the 2030 objective to reduce Scope/uni00A01 and/uni00A02 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n- \u00b7 Targeting carbon neutrality before 2040 for all GBUs except Soda Ash, and before 2050 for the hard-to-abate Soda Ash activity. This roadmap will require around \u20ac2/uni00A0billion in investments and is expected to generate compelling economic returns.\n- \u00b7 Solvay will also not build new coal-powered plants and has committed to phasing out the use of solid fuels (coal and petcoke) in energy production by 2030 wherever renewable alternatives exist.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Solvay has set a 2030 target to reduce by 24% scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from its top five categories both upstream and downstream in the value chain and representing 85% of the total scope 3. - Early 2023, the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has validated the Solvay 2030 targets with a slight adjustment to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 31%.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of potential climate change impacts on our operations due to flooding, water scarcity, hurricanes, and other environmental events through the application of best-in-class models and collaboration with external experts.\n- \u00b7 Establishment of a task force that develops renewable energy and other energy transition projects adapted to local markets and regulations.\n- \u00b7 Raising our internal carbon price from \u20ac50 to \u20ac100/uni00A0per metric ton of CO 2 on greenhouse gas emissions from operations and using our Sustainable Portfolio Management tool (SPM) to assess all capital investment decisions worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Alignment of R&I projects with market expectations and assessment of operations exposure relating to the environment using an SPM lens.\n- \u00b7 Linking the long term incentives of senior executives to our achievements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## 2.5.3. Main actions in 2022\n\nA new climate transition scenario analysis was performed in 2022, in line with the TCFD updated recommendations for scenario analysis. Two scenarios were considered: the 2021 International Energy Agency 'Stated Policies Scenario' and the 'Net Zero Emissions by 2050' scenario. As a first step, the analysis focused on the three GBUs responsible for about 60% of our total greenhouse gas emissions and with exposure to markets or raw materials that have the potential to be significantly affected by climate change: Soda Ash, Specialty Polymers and Novecare. The analysis is described in detail in the Extra-financial statements section of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nThe quantitative analysis considered:\n\n- \u00b7 The evolution in the cost of energy, CO 2 and raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Price and volume changes, based on the market impacts of each scenario.\n- \u00b7 Adaptation potential, or the cost passed through to customers.\n\nAssuming that Solvay takes no decisions other than those currently announced, the conclusion of the analysis was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Soda Ash business is reliant on a competitive price advantage. As the cost of energy, raw materials and Solvay operations increases, the business will need to pass on costs to ensure business profitability. It will benefit from additional demand for glass, which is needed in energy efficient buildings. It will drive profit and sales overall.\n- \u00b7 The Specialty Polymers business has the best opportunities in a +1.5\u00b0C world. Demand for our value-based solutions will provide incentive to increase prices, but additional production capacities are likely to be required to meet sustained demand and ensure costs can be effectively passed through to customers.\n- \u00b7 The Novecare business faces risks relating to vegetable oil imports, since vegetable oils from palm oil, and other alternatives, produce significant CO 2 emissions and are highly water intensive. Shifting to sustainable alternatives is expected to be costly at the beginning, but these costs will decrease in the long run, while also bringing reputational benefits. Novecare has the highest-weighted CO 2 emissions intensity in their supply chain and Solvay is engaging with suppliers to reduce Scope 3 emissions.\n\nCost pass through measures have already been implemented. The analysis will be extended to more GBUs, and to physical risks.\n\nClimate emissions reduction actions are described in detail in the Extra-financial section of the Annual Integrated Report. Among the numerous actions taken are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In Rheinberg, Germany, the first boiler using biomass instead of coal went into operation in May 2021, and a decision has been taken to install a second biomass boiler, to be operational before 2025. This will allow us to phase out coal and reduce Group greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 4%.\n- \u00b7 In Dombasle, France, we have taken the decision to shift from coal to RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel). This will allow us to phase out coal at the site by 2024 and reduce the Group GHG emissions by 2%.\n- \u00b7 Our multiple energy transition projects implemented or committed globally in 2021 will ensure that 35% of the electricity we purchase comes from renewable sources.\n- \u00b7 An annual review of climate-related risks and opportunities for each product in each market performed with the Solvay SPM tool. This shows that our climate-related Solutions (18% of sales) outnumber our climate-related Challenges (3% of sales). For more information, see 5.1 Product Design and Life Cycle Management in the Extra-financial Statements section of this report.\n\nThe current risk linked to floods and hurricanes is assessed annually with our insurers. This exercise identifies sites in risk areas with a maximum foreseeable loss greater than US$10/uni00A0million. Seven Solvay sites are located in high frequency (2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of US$13.5-196.4/uni00A0 million. Fifteen Solvay sites are located in low frequency (0.2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of US$14243.3/uni00A0million. One site is located in a wind exposed area, with a loss expectancy of US$17.3/uni00A0million. Solvay has a damage insurance program in place to cover catastrophic risks, while covering smaller losses through self-insurance.\n\nSites in areas of water scarcity have been identified, and the risks have been assessed based on their water consumption and maximum foreseeable loss. Thirty-one Solvay sites are located in areas subject to hydric stress, of which eight have been identified as having a high business impact. The highest annual business interruption value is \u20ac400/uni00A0million.",

Risk description\n\nThere are several risks relating to raw materials, energy, materials and equipment for construction and maintenance, suppliers, production, storage units, and inbound and outbound transportation. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Inability of suppliers to deliver contracted volumes or capacities in line with required specifications, due to force majeure, for example, or because the supplier has insufficient access to Logistic Service Provider capacities.\n- \u00b7 Insufficient contracting of volumes or capacities, from both a volume and delivery timing perspective, to fulfill our demand.\n- \u00b7 Delayed delivery of volumes or capacities.\n\n## 3.2.2.

Main actions in 2022\n\nWith uncertainty and volatility continuing to prevail, supply chains need to continue their transformation toward additional agility using End-to-End process revision and the implementation of new tools. Logistical constraints should soften progressively, with additional capacities for container transportation. A potential new Covid lockdown in China also carries significant risk of logistical disruption.\n\nBased on our experience in 2022, we have tested several options which would give us increased flexibility in sourcing, providing us with opportunities should risk materialize. Our inventory management has also improved, toward a more segmented approach, better visibility and better End-to-End alignment.

The Group has access to a Belgian Treasury Bill program for \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion and, as an alternative, to a US commercial paper program worth US$500/uni00A0million, both unused at the end of 2022.\n\n## Currency hedging policy\n\nSolvay monitors the foreign exchange market closely and takes hedging measures to:\n\n- \u00b7 Limit the fluctuation of the Group's forecasted gross margin caused by currency volatility for material exposures.\n- \u00b7 Mitigate the foreign exchange transactional risk at Group level by limiting the profit and loss (P&L) impact of rate fluctuations between the time of invoicing and the time of cash settlement.\n\n## Interest rate hedging policy\n\n- \u00b7 The Group locks in the majority of its net indebtedness at fixed interest rates. Solvay monitors the interest rate market closely and enters into interest rate swaps whenever they are deemed appropriate.\n\n## Energy and CO 2 hedging policy\n\nSolvay hedges energy prices - gas, coal and electricity - based on the net exposure of our sales not indexed on energy prices. This policy includes multi-year hedging transactions. The Group net exposure to carbon pricing is managed through hedging transactions spanning the time horizon of the European Union Emissions Trading Systems.\n\n## Monitoring of Group counterparties' ratings\n\nFor our treasury activities, Solvay works with banking institutions of high creditworthiness (investment grade, selected based on major rating systems) and minimizes the concentration of risk by limiting our exposure to each of these banks to a predefined threshold. We regularly monitor trends in Credit Default Swaps to assess changes in bank creditworthiness and take rapid action if required.\n\nFor our commercial activities, Solvay's external customer risk and cash collection is monitored by a professional network of credit managers and cash collectors located in the Group's various operating regions and countries. Their controls are supported by a set of detailed procedures and managed through Corporate and GBU Credit Committees. These loss mitigation measures have led, over the past few years, to a record low rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Pension governance and pension plan optimization\n\nWith regard to pension governance, Solvay engages proactively and constructively with trustees and stakeholders to ensure that funding, liability management and investment policies are appropriate, in line with best practice and in full compliance with domestic regulatory expectations and laws.\n\nIn terms of pension plan optimization, we reduce the Group's exposure to defined-benefit plans either by converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile for future services or closing them to new entrants.\n\nFor each of the main Group pension plans, which represent about 90% of the Group's gross or net pension obligations, Asset Liability Management (ALM) analyses are performed at least once every three years to identify and manage corresponding risks.\n\n## Control processes for tax regulation compliance and transfer pricing policies\n\nOur control processes for tax regulation compliance involve monitoring procedures and systems, which we carry out thorough internal reviews and audits performed by reputable external consultants.\n\nOur transfer pricing policies, procedures and controls are aimed at meeting the requirements of the authorities.\n\nSolvay's Tax department pays close attention to the correct interpretation and application of new tax rules. This ensures compliance with applicable rules and regulations and avoids tax and future litigation risks.\n\n## 3.3.3. Main actions in 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Successful repayment of the remaining portion of the Solvay SA Euro bonds, due in December 2022 (\u20ac377.5/uni00A0million), as well as the early redemption of the Cytec bonds on January 1, 2023 (US$196.1 million, plus the accrued interests).\n- \u00b7 Full repayment of the Rusvinyl debt (equivalent of \u20ac100/uni00A0million) and release of the Solvay guarantees (~\u20ac83/uni00A0million).\n- \u00b7 Closing of the Dombasle Energy SPV Project finance (\u20ac225/uni00A0million)\n- \u00b7 Preparation work in view of the intended spin-off announced in March 2022.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of ESG debt capital market issuances in the chemical industry.\n- \u00b7 Compliance for \"Ibor-transition rates\" to risk-free rates and adjustments of financing documentation.\n- \u00b7 Optimizing our liquidity reserves and rebalancing the refinancing strategy of some bilateral credit facilities.\n- \u00b7 Further contribution of \u20ac155 million in Germany in the third quarter of 2022.",

Risks related to Solvay's transformation\n\n## 3.5.1. Risk description\n\nAs announced on March 15, 2022, Solvay is reviewing plans to separate the Company into two independent, publicly traded companies. For further details, please refer to the introduction section of this annual integrated report. Risks related to the Power of Two project include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.\n\n- \u00b7 This major transformation project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023, subject to general market conditions and satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by Solvay's Board of Directors, shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions, consent of certain financing providers and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, or unanticipated developments, could delay the implementation of the separation for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all.\n- \u00b7 The implementation of the contemplated separation will likely continue to require significant time and attention of our management, which could impact other strategic initiatives, ongoing business concerns and the Group's ability to attract new business and maintain existing operational and client relationships. The separation will also place significant demands on certain functions that will be heavily involved, particularly Finance, Accounting and Digital Technology.\n- \u00b7 During the implementation phase, a new governance and organizational structure will have to be set up at the level of SpecialtyCo and EssentialCo, which may affect employee morale due to uncertainty concerns as to their future roles within the separate companies and lead to departures of key personnel. Failure to motivate and retain key personnel could force us to divert significant time and efforts and incur additional costs to hire and train highly skilled employees as replacement in a competitive market. Despite our efforts to identify and train suitable individuals to hold senior management and key executive positions, we may not be successful in recruiting internally or externally, or in effectively transferring knowledge to newly hired employees and senior leadership teams, which may result in either or both companies' ability to successfully develop and achieve the strategic purpose of the separation being adversely affected.\n- \u00b7 In order to implement the targeted post-spin-off capital structures of SpecialtyCo and EssentialCo, the separation project will comprise several liability management transactions to allocate certain financial instruments outstanding at the time of the partial demerger, and to seek approval of amendments to or waivers of certain terms and conditions of the relevant instruments. While Solvay expects to have backup plans ready in case the liability management transactions are not successful, failure to successfully complete these transactions may adversely affect SpecialtyCo's and EssentialCo's ability to reach their target capital structures or result in delays in the implementation of the separation.\n- \u00b7 As announced in March 2022, Solvay expects to structure the separation in a manner that would be tax efficient for a significant majority of shareholders in key jurisdictions. However, there can be no assurance that the intended tax treatment will be achieved, or that any ruling (or similar guidance) from any taxing authority would be sought or, if sought, granted.",

In this context, litigation is a normal recurring feature of Solvay's operating business, both to protect against claims, some of which we believe to be without merit, and to defend the rights and interests of the Group.\n\nOngoing legal proceedings involving the Solvay Group that are currently considered to potentially involve significant risks are outlined below. The legal proceedings described below do not constitute an exhaustive list.\n\nThe proceedings summarized below represent the material matters pending against Solvay regardless of the merits of the claims and the strengths of Solvay's defenses. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any proceeding described below; Solvay will continue to vigorously defend itself based on the merits of its defenses while opportunistically seeking consensual resolution in appropriate cases.\n\nFor certain cases, we have created reserves or provisions in accordance with appropriate accounting governing rules and policies, to cover financial risk and defense costs (see the section 'Provisions for litigation to the consolidated financial statements' in this report). In doing so, we do not ordinarily disclose the extent to which provisions are made in relation to individual proceedings, because to do so would be prejudicial to Solvay's interests. In addition, we maximize all available insurance coverage. Adverse outcomes of material contested matters, individually or in the aggregate, could exceed the amounts of applicable provisions or insurance coverage, and could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and earnings of the Group.\n\n## Antitrust proceedings\n\nIn Brazil, CADE (the Brazilian antitrust authority) issued fines against Solvay and others in May 2012, relating to hydrogen peroxide activities, and in February 2016, relating to perborate activities. Solvay's share of these fines amounts to \u20ac29.6/uni00A0million and \u20ac3.99/uni00A0million respectively. We have filed a claim with the Brazilian Federal Court contesting these administrative fines.\n\n## HSE related proceedings\n\n- \u00b7 PFAS: A Solvay subsidiary in the US is a defendant in 35/uni00A0separate lawsuits relating to its use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The vast majority of these cases (30) are pending in the federal and state courts in New Jersey, in the US, and the majority (27) are claims by private plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring or compensation for alleged personal injury or other alleged economic loss. Two of the cases involve civil claims by separate US state governmental authorities - New Jersey and Michigan - seeking various damages, including natural resource damages. The State of New Jersey also seeks the environmental cleanup of PFAS pollution allegedly caused by a single operating facility of the subsidiary in New Jersey. Two/uni00A0 cases allege that products purchased from the subsidiary' caused contamination elsewhere. We continue to vigorously defend against these actions, as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Asbestos Cases: Twenty-nine civil proceedings have been brought before Italian Courts by past workers and relatives of deceased workers at Solvay sites seeking damages, provisionally quantified at approximately \u20ac32 million, in relation to diseases allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos. Eleven proceedings are still pending before Courts of first instance and Courts of Appeal whilst the remaining 18/uni00A0proceedings definitively ended as a result of dismissals, court settlements and condemnations to pay negligible damages.\n- \u00b7 Spinetta site: A preliminary criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of Alessandria, Italy into the alleged crime of culpable environmental disaster against two Solvay managers were closed in December 2022. We expect the final decision of the Public Prosecutor Office by the end of/uni00A0Q1 2023.\n- \u00b7 Rosignano site: Preliminary criminal investigations, started in 2019 by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of Livorno, regarding the alleged contamination of certain water tables outside our site of Rosignano, Italy site are still pending.\n- \u00b7 Bussi site: administrative litigation cases are still pending in relation to the identification of the alleged polluter of the Bussi, Italy industrial site (which we sold in/uni00A02016) and of the Tirino River. These litigation cases were started by Edison, as the former owner of the Bussi site, in 2020 and 2022 as the same Edison had been recognised by the competent administrative authorities as 'sole and exclusive polluter' of both the Bussi industrial site and the Tirino River.\n\n## Pharmaceutical activities (discontinued):/uni00A0\n\nThe contractual arrangements for the sale of our pharmaceutical activities in February 2010 established the terms and conditions for the allocation and sharing of liability arising out of activities carried out before the sale. Subject to limited exceptions, Solvay's exposure for indemnification to Abbott for liabilities arising out of sold activities is limited to an aggregate amount of \u20ac500/uni00A0million, with limited duration. All post-closing indemnification claims made against Solvay have now been resolved except liabilities arising from private civil antitrust claims made against the buyer of the business. Solvay's potential exposure is limited to a possible clawback of up to the \u20ac300/uni00A0million received by Solvay as an additional purchase price based on post-closing ANDROGEL\u00ae sales.",

OVERVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED EXTRA-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSince 2019, Solvay has significantly extended our sustainability strategy, both in terms of scope and in terms of ambition, and this is fully encapsulated in our Solvay One Planet roadmap. This increased focus on sustainability was accompanied by a substantial increase in the human and financial resources dedicated to sustainability and a deeper integration of sustainability into calculations of short- and long-term variable remuneration. Structured around the three major categories of climate, resources and better life, our Solvay One Planet roadmap ensures that Solvay must deliver more than just strong financial results, by acting responsibly for all stakeholders and promoting progress toward a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. Performance and delivery matter more than targets and promises, and this is especially true in matters pertaining to sustainability.\n\nSolvay continued to make strong progress on this journey in 2022, meeting or exceeding targets. We accelerated efforts to meet stakeholders' growing expectations, including protecting the most vulnerable during the pandemic, set more ambitious environmental targets and built partnerships to enable the circular economy.\n\nPast figures are as published (without restatements).\n\nR: reasonable assurance\n\nL: limited assurance\n\nMt: Million metric tons\n\nMm 3 : Million cubic meters\n\nPJ: Peta Joules\n\n## CLIMATE\n\n|                                        | Units                    | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2018                     |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| PRIORITY TOPICS                        | PRIORITY TOPICS          | PRIORITY TOPICS          | PRIORITY TOPICS          | PRIORITY TOPICS          | PRIORITY TOPICS          | PRIORITY TOPICS          |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions               | Greenhouse gas emissions | Greenhouse gas emissions | Greenhouse gas emissions | Greenhouse gas emissions | Greenhouse gas emissions | Greenhouse gas emissions |\n| Scope 1                                | Mt CO 2  eq.             | 9.2                      | 9.6                      | 8.9                      | 10.6                     | 10.4                     |\n| Scope 2 - gross market-based           | Mt CO 2  eq.             | 1.1                      | 1.4                      | 1.2                      | 1.4                      | 1.9                      |\n| Total Scope 1+2                        | Mt CO 2  eq.             | 10.3                     | 11.0                     | 10.1                     | 12.0                     | 12.3                     |\n| Scope 3                                | Mt CO 2  eq.             | 24.2                     | 25.8                     | 28.8                     | 32.6                     | 34.2                     |\n| Total scopes 1+2+3                     | Mt CO 2  eq.             | 34.5                     | 36.8                     | 38.9                     | 44.6                     | 46.5                     |\n| Biodiversity                           | Biodiversity             | Biodiversity             | Biodiversity             | Biodiversity             | Biodiversity             | Biodiversity             |\n| Species potentially affected           | Number                   | 88                       | 93                       | 107                      | 116                      | 122                      |\n| HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS                | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  | HIGH MATERIALITY TOPICS  |\n| Energy                                 | Energy                   | Energy                   | Energy                   | Energy                   | Energy                   | Energy                   |\n| Fuel consumption for energy production | PJ                       | 98                       | 105                      | 99                       | 107                      | 93                       |\n| Energy purchased                       | PJ                       | 29                       | 33                       | 34                       | 38                       | 45                       |\n| Energy sold                            | PJ                       | 26                       | 33                       | 31                       | 32                       | 23                       |\n| Primary energy consumption             | PJ                       | 101                      | 106                      | 103                      | 113                      | 115                      |\n| Solid fuels                            | PJ                       | 28                       | 27                       | 27                       | 32                       | 33                       |",

Reporting frameworks\n\nThe main reporting frameworks used to prepare the Annual Integrated Report are:\n\n- \u00b7 GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards: the GRI standards are the main reference for Solvay's sustainability reporting; the latest edition of the standards is used, including the new GRI-1 and GRI-2 universal standards.\n- \u00b7 2014/95/EU: Solvay uses the GRI Standards to comply with Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. The Directive was transposed into Belgian law in September 2017.\n- \u00b7 EU Taxonomy: a first estimate of eligible activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy in the delegated act of April 2021 is presented in 5.1. Product design and life cycle management.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Global Compact: the information provided serves as a progress report on implementation of the United Nations Global Compact's ten principles.\n- \u00b7 Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Solvay reports on our alignment with the 11/uni00A0recommendations of the TCFD.\n- \u00b7 RESPONSIBLE CARE\u00ae: Solvay is a signatory to the International Council of Chemical Associations' (ICCA) Responsible Care Global Charter\u00ae.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Reporting Framework: Solvay adheres to the principles and content elements of Integrated Reporting, as described in the 'International Framework' published by the IFRS Foundation.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB): Solvay aligns our materiality analysis with the SASB approach to prepare the SASB Materiality Map\u2122. For more details, see the Materiality Analysis section of this chapter.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Solvay has identified the nine Sustainable Development Goals on which it can have the most impact, through its operations or across the value chain, in line with the materiality analysis.\n- \u00b7 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): Solvay's report aligns with the WBCSD ESG Disclosure Handbook guidance in terms of process and content selection.\n- \u00b7 World Economic Forum: Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation September 2020: Solvay reports on the WEF report Core Metrics and Disclosures.\n\nSolvay also monitors developments in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), included in the new European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as the IFRS Sustainability Standards, and we are preparing to comply early and in full, to the maximum extent possible, with these standards when the official versions are available.\n\n## 2.2.  Reporting scope and boundaries\n\n## GRI DIsclosuRes 2-2 2-3 2-4 2-7\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the environmental and social reporting boundaries are consistent with the financial reporting scope and boundaries, as described in the 'List of companies included in the consolidation scope' in the financial statements. In other words, social and environmental indicators are consolidated according to the equity share approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of the site of Devnya, Bulgaria, have been consolidated at 75%.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of non consolidated power plants in Spinetta (Italy) and La Rochelle (France) have been consolidated at 100% as per contractual agreements.\n\nHeadcount refers to employees that have an employment contract with Solvay and are classified as active, as they have a position in the organizational chart. Social indicators relative to headcount (i.e. occupational safety, diversity and inclusion, recruitment and retention) include employees in non consolidated companies and in companies consolidated by applying the equity method of accounting.\n\nSolvay uses the 'rolling base year' approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate target achievements.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, past years are not restated for extra-financial indicators.\n\nThe reporting scope includes all high materiality topics, as identified in Solvay's materiality analysis. Some low or moderate materiality topics have been included because they are requested by specific groups of stakeholders./uni00A0\n\nReporting practices specific to the dimension reported are integrated in the corresponding 'Definitions' subsection.",

Materiality analysis process\n\nSolvay's Sustainable Development Function coordinates materiality analysis with an internal network of Sustainability Champions in the Global Business Units and Functions. Experts in each Corporate Function review the analysis of each aspect, paying particular attention to ensuring consistency with the Group's risk analysis. These assessments are then reviewed and validated by the relevant business leadership teams, which is a critical step in ensuring that business priorities and decisions reflect sustainability matters appropriately.\n\n| Identification of topics                               | Use of the Value Reporting Foundation - SASB Materiality Map list of topics.

The network of Sustainability Champions and internal experts for each high materiality aspect was involved in  the prioritization analysis. In addition to the SASB prioritization criteria, an additional focus on external impacts has been included in  the assessment since the publication of Solvay's Purpose in 2019. This led to the review of the materiality  analysis, which led to the publication of the Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition in 2020. |\n| Validation                                             | Review of the analysis by the Executive Committee and the Global Business Units and Corporate Functions  leaders.

The Russia-Ukraine war and the energy crisis in Europe confirmed the priorities defined during the preparative work for Solvay One Planet, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 An increased emphasis on climate change and biodiversity, with evidence of the link between climate resilience and energy security and independence;\n- \u00b7 An increased emphasis on social topics, with evidence of the global inflation crisis exacerbating inequalities and poverty;\n- \u00b7 An increased emphasis on health and safety, with evidence of growing concerns about the use of hazardous materials.\n\nDevelopments in 2022 reinforce the view that Solvay's priorities helped to anticipate issues and ensure rapid responses where appropriate, ensuring the resilience of our operations.\n\n## 2.3.4. Why is it material?\n\nThe tables below summarize Solvay's assessment of high materiality topics for each category. The corresponding United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are used to describe what impacts are considered, where they may occur and how they may be caused.

Each of these 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) includes specific targets to be achieved by 2030. Achieving the SDGs requires efforts by governments, the private sector, civil society, communities and individuals.\n\nNine leading chemical companies, including Solvay, and two industry associations formed a working group dedicated to the SDGs, convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). This working group took a leadership role in piloting and refining the three-step framework described in the WBCSD's SDG Sector Roadmap Guidelines.\n\nAs part of this exercise, Solvay identified the Sustainable Development Goals on which we could have a material impact, positive or negative. We then integrated these sustainable development goals into our materiality analysis as the official agenda of the 'Planet' (Governments and NGOs) stakeholder group.\n\nThis preliminary list was reviewed in 2019, within the context of the Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition, with an increasing focus on the impact of products and operations.\n\nSolvay's main areas of impact can be grouped into three categories: climate, resources and better life. The corresponding list of SDGs on which Solvay can have the most impact, positive or negative, through our operations and the products we sell, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 C limate and biodiversity, which includes the Group's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and other emissions or effluents that put pressure on biodiversity, but also products that may impact customers' energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions:\n- -SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy\n- -SDG 13: Climate action\n- -SDG 14: Life below water\n- -SDG 15: Life on land\n- \u00b7 Resources, which includes the Group's raw material consumption, water consumption, effluents, emissions and waste generation, but also products' life cycles and end-of-life management:\n- -SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production\n- \u00b7 Better life, which includes the Group's management of hazardous materials, people, process and product safety, social dialogue initiatives and potential social impacts of our product portfolio:\n- -SDG 3: Good health and well-being\n- -SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation\n- -SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth\n- -SDG 17: Partnership for the goals",

Definition\n\nThe Solvay One Planet Guide is the sustainability reference framework for the Solvay Group, established in 2019. It addresses Solvay's main impacts on climate, resources and better life, describing our management approach and metrics.\n\nThe Guide is organized in three work axes: content, performance and assessment. Through the content axis we help every Solvay employee understand the indicators that are part of our Solvay One Planet program. The Group targets are sorted per impact category, namely climate, resources and better life, and for each target we describe:\n\n- \u00b7 What we are talking about, why it is important and the main legislation, where relevant.\n- \u00b7 Solvay's ambition: internal definitions which are relevant for the target, our footprint, our actions and ambitions, and key contacts.\n\nThe performance axis includes a dashboard with the results of the Solvay One Planet targets for the entire Group.\n\n## 3.1.2. Management approach\n\nThe Solvay One Planet Guide was launched on September 1, 2021. The management approach and metrics have been deployed in all entities of the Group. Each Global Business Unit (GBU) president is accountable for the progress of Solvay One Planet in their business, and delegates the coordination of the roadmap to a senior executive in their leadership team.\n\nA network of Sustainability Champions and correspondents ensures that the Guide is deployed in all Solvay sites, GBUs and Corporate Functions. They inform their entity about any changes to the strategy and objectives, ensure necessary training is organized, and develop an annual and multi-year roadmap to meet final objectives. They are then responsible for implementing the roadmap in their entity, though the leaders of every entity take full ultimate responsibility for performance, also taking into account that progress relative to targets impacts the variable remuneration of all senior staff in the entity.\n\nDefinitions, management approach, indicators and targets, and main actions specific to each topic are described in the corresponding sections of the Extra-financial statements. The management approach is adjusted each year based on the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 feedback from employees, suppliers and customers;\n- \u00b7 knowledge gained from performance and progress in relation to strategic commitments;\n- \u00b7 challenges orchestrated by the Executive Leadership Team, facilitated by the Sustainable Development function, taking into account changes in the marketplace and higher expectations from Solvay executives;\n- \u00b7 the evolution of frameworks and reporting standards, such as GRI Standards;\n- \u00b7 the auditors' report on high materiality topics;\n- \u00b7 feedback from practitioners;\n- \u00b7 feedback from sustainability rating agencies;\n- \u00b7 feedback received on the Annual Integrated Report, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's 'Reporting Matters' yearly analysis.\n\nIn order to further improve the employee awareness about the guide and what is at stake with our Solvay One Planet program, and to ensure the deployment of the program from top management to the shop floor, we launched a Sustainability e-learning program in 2022, which is available to all Solvay employees.\n\nThis learning program is composed of four modules: Climate; Nature; Sustainable Business; and Social Responsibility. The modules are available in seven different languages, allowing us to reach as many employees as possible. The modules also encourage employees to provide their ideas, feedback and concerns on sustainability matters.\n\n## 3.1.3. Indicators and targets\n\nSolvay One Planet is our roadmap for a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. Structured around the three major impact categories of climate, resources, and better life, it sets out the following main targets to be achieved by 2030, as compared to the 2018 baseline:\n\n## Climate Pillar\n\n- \u00b7 GHG reduction: reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\n- \u00b7 Solid fuels phase-out: phase out of solid fuels (coal and petcoke - excluding anthracite and coke considered as raw materials) used in energy production, wherever renewable alternatives exist. Coke and anthracite used in the soda ash production process are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity preservation: reduce negative pressure by 30%.",

        "page_content": "## Resource Pillar\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable solutions: 65% of total Group sales to come from sustainable solutions.\n- \u00b7 Circular economy: more than double total Group sales to come from renewable or recycled resources.\n- \u00b7 Waste: reduce industrial waste by 30%.\n- \u00b7 Water: reduce freshwater intake by 25%.\n\n## Better Life Pillar\n\n- \u00b7 Safety: make Solvay a safe organization with a zero accidents mindset.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity: gender parity for mid- and senior-level management by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Maternity and paternity leave: extended to 16 weeks and to co-parents inside the company, regardless of gender, in 2021.\n\n## 3.2.  Management of the legal, ethics and regulatory framework\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-26 2-27 3-3 205-2 205-3 406-1 415-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH\n\nManagement of the legal, ethics and regulatory framework encompasses business ethics, namely human rights, anti-corruption and non-discrimination, and anti-competitive behavior.\n\n## 3.2.1. Commitments and policies\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity and the policies and procedures adopted to enhance good governance apply to all employees wherever they are located. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 third parties are expected to act within the framework of the Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 all core suppliers must confirm that they adhere to the principles set out in the Solvay Supplier Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 majority-owned joint ventures are held to the Solvay Code of Business Integrity, or to a separate code adopted based on similar principles.\n- \u00b7 The Code of Business Integrity is available on Solvay's website.\n\n## Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Policy on Gifts and Entertainment\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity expressly states that the Group prohibits bribery in any form. Solvay and our employees do not use gifts or entertainment to gain competitive advantage. Facilitation payments are not permitted by Solvay and disguising gifts or entertainment as charitable donations is also a violation of the Code of Business Integrity.\n\nThe Code is supported by more detailed policies. At the end of 2020, Solvay split our Gifts, Entertainment and Anti-Bribery Policy into two separate policies: an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and a Policy on Gifts, Entertainment, Charitable Donations, and Sponsorship.\n\nThe Group employs an internal tracking system to record gifts and entertainment that exceed the acceptable reasonable value applicable in each region, as well as charitable donations and sponsorship with charitable purpose, and requires manager approval for accepting or giving them. The use of the Gift and Entertainment Tracking System ('GETS') is part of Solvay's Internal Audit review process.\n\nSolvay is also a member of Transparency International Belgium.\n\n## Human Rights in Business Policy\n\nSolvay's Human Rights in Business Policy, published on our website, sets out Solvay's commitment to respecting human rights and acting with due diligence to avoid any infringement of human rights or any adverse impact on or abuses of such rights. The policy emphasizes Solvay's commitments to our stakeholders, namely our employees and business partners, the communities and environment in which we operate and children.\n\nSolvay has a Global Human Rights Committee (GHRC), which oversees implementation of the policy, ensures compliance and monitors the Group's performance. Members of the Global Human Rights Committee include the heads of the following Solvay business service activities: General Counsel; Compliance; Human Resources; Procurement; Communication; Internal Audit and Risk Management; and Sustainable Development. The GHRC is chaired by the Group General Counsel, who is the head of the General Counsel Function. Members of Solvay's Global Business Units and other business service activities contribute to the work of the GHRC on an ad hoc basis, as necessary.\n\nThe GHRC discusses its activities before the Group's annual report is issued, and also validates any human rights reporting made in conjunction with the report. Upon request, the Chair of the GHRC may be called upon to provide an annual report to the Audit Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Human rights due diligence and risk assessment\n\nTwo parallel processes are used to assess human rights risks at Solvay sites. These focus on Solvay employees, based on internal data, or on our business partners, namely suppliers and contractors identified according to the risk associated with the country they operate in. Six human rights dimensions are considered: child labor; forced labor; trafficking in persons; human development; freedom of association; and collective bargaining. The assessment is used by Solvay's internal auditors to identify priorities for their work on the subject.\n\nThis assessment was suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, as priorities shifted to protecting the most vulnerable employees and local communities from the impact and consequences of the pandemic.\n\n## Competition Law Policy\n\nSolvay's goal is to conduct business ethically and not to enter into any business arrangements that eliminate or distort competition. Solvay develops and maintains a culture of compliance to keep the company and our people on the right side of the law. Solvay has a formal Competition Law Policy that stresses the importance of strict adherence to all competition laws. It has been approved by Solvay's Executive Committee and is published on Solvay's intranet, to which all our employees have access. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, subject to, and in conformity with, applicable laws.\n\n## Implementation of the Competition Law Policy\n\nSolvay has put in place a Competition Law Compliance Program that has a zero-tolerance approach to competition law infringements. As part of our Competition Law Compliance Program, we provide a competition law toolkit on the Solvay intranet that includes up-to-date guidelines on specific areas of competition law, including guidance on dealing with competitors, dawn raids, information exchange on mergers and acquisitions transactions, swaps, price announcements and vertical relationships.\n\nTo minimize cartel risks, Solvay has put in place a computer-based system that tracks all contacts relevant employees have with competitors through a procedure based on managerial approval./uni00A0\n\n## 3.2.2. Resources and responsibilities\n\nSolvay set up a compliance organization to reinforce a Group-wide culture based on ethics and compliance. The Ethics and Compliance Department operates under the leadership of the Chief People Officer, who also works closely with the Group General Counsel. It consists of Regional Compliance Officers who serve in the four zones in which the Group operates, under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to the Chief People Officer. This department is responsible for investigating, either alone or with the assistance of other departments, all reports that are brought to its attention. All cases of non-compliance with the Solvay Code of Business Integrity and related policies and procedures, including Speak Up, are reported to the Leadership Team and the Board of Directors Audit Committee annually.\n\nSolvay has a dedicated team of legal experts for competition law within the General Counsel Function. They are responsible for implementing the Competition Law Compliance Program and are in charge of providing competition law advice and guidance, as well as deploying effective and regular communication and training on subjects related to competition law.\n\n## 3.2.3. Grievance mechanisms\n\nEmployees have various internal channels through which they are encouraged to report suspected violations or concerns. These include management, Human Resources, the General Counsel Function, Ethics and Compliance, Internal Audit and employees' representatives.\n\nA Group-wide Speak Up program is in place and overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. An external, third-party helpline, active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, allows employees to ask questions, raise concerns or file reports. The helpline is open to internal and external parties, available in nineteen languages covering most of Solvay locations.\n\nThe following chart shows the types of claims made from January to December 2022 through Solvay's Speak Up program.",

In keeping with our commitment to transparency, the Speak Up tool is used to report progress on investigations and to communicate the results of investigations that have concluded directly to those concerned. An online brochure advertising the website and toll-free numbers needed to access this tool in the relevant region are available to employees.\n\nA communication campaign was also launched in 2022 to increase awareness about speaking up and raising concerns without fear of retaliation when people notice a potential breach of our Code of Business Integrity. Speak Up was also part of the annual mandatory training for all our employees, in order to raise awareness that speaking up applies to the full spectrum of topics referenced in the Code of Business Integrity. This led to an increase in reported incidents, as reflected in the overview, and increased our ability to detect, identify and address breaches. The increase in reported incidents does not imply that there were more incidents or issues in 2022 than before, but shows that employees reach out more to report potential breaches, enabling us to investigate and address them. New topics, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Human Rights Violations, were added to our Ethics Helpline, reflecting the increased regulatory focus on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) topics, and on the supply chain and third parties.\n\nThe Board's Audit Committee oversees the running of Speak Up and reviews the effectiveness of the process and the outcomes in depth.",

Communication and training\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nMandatory Code of Business Integrity training, both in person and web-based, is organized for all employees to ensure understanding and to address behavioral risks, such as anti-bribery and corruption, conflict of interest and harassment. As part of this training, employees are also trained on the Speak Up Helpline. Specific anti-corruption training is tailored to management. Special campaigns to maintain and improve awareness levels in the Group are identified and implemented annually. In the period 2021-2022, 98% of the target population was trained on the Code of Business Integrity. Antibribery and anti-corruption training takes place every two years, with a new training course planned for 2023. In the period 2020-2021, 96% of the target population was trained on the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\n## Competition Law and Antitrust/uni00A0\n\nSolvay has a concrete Competition Law Compliance Action Plan, designed to mitigate the specific risks the Group has identified in this field of law. It has been in force since 2003 and is updated yearly. In 2022, it covered e-learnings on competition law in general, on activities in trade associations, and on the use of the above-mentioned computerized tracking system of meetings with competitors. We also organized ad hoc training for specific high-risk target populations. All training courses had participation rates of over 95%.\n\n## Anti-Corruption\n\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption training is now carried out on a two-year cycle for a pre-identified target population. The most recent online training course took place in 2021, with 96% of the target population, which includes all employees grade S15 and above, completing the course. The training will be rolled out again in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Public policy\n\nSolvay pursues a constructive dialogue with governmental and political stakeholders, both to ensure and improve our license to operate and as part of our commitment to developing sustainable solutions with partners. This exchange helps us to understand societal trends and anticipate legislative and regulatory expectations and developments as well as to advocate for and communicate our views in support of Solvay's interests. These includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting sustainable solutions to act on climate change and facilitate the energy transition: Solvay supports the UN Paris Climate Agreement and contributes to implementing it. We therefore argue for the development of a clear and predictable legislative framework that promotes sustainable growth while maintaining industry competitiveness and ensuring a balanced transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- \u00b7 Competitiveness: Solvay advocates for a regulatory system that fosters entrepreneurship and industrial innovation by safeguarding or improving competitiveness, and that creates highly-skilled jobs worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Environmental and chemical policy: Solvay collaborates with trade associations, public authorities and other stakeholders to develop science- and riskbased regulations and standards that promote a more sustainable industry and products.\n- \u00b7 Promoting global trade: as an international company, Solvay recognizes the importance of free trade based on a multilateral and rules-based trading system. Reducing trade barriers is essential for economic growth and thus for industrial activity.\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical assessment: Solvay assesses the geopolitical situation in order to better understand the potential impact, in relation to trade, logistics, investments and security, on our businesses.\n\nSolvay's Government Affairs and Country Management Function is responsible for coordinating our relations with government and political officials. In line with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, and with the aim of ensuring the best possible business environment, the Government Affairs and Country Management team works to foster long-term partnerships with public authorities and other relevant stakeholders. They do this by building a transparent and constructive dialogue that supports company strategy./uni00A0\n\nIn our relations with government officials, we commit ourselves to responsible, honest and transparent action based on our values and principles. We are committed to ensuring that our dialogue and advocacy complies with our Code of Business Integrity, and the rules and principles set out in our policies. Employees involved in relations with government officials have to take mandatory training on business integrity, competition law, and antitrust and anticorruption. In addition, we welcome initiatives for greater transparency in the area of interest representation and are listed as a company in the Lobby and Transparency registers of the European Commission, the United States, France and Germany.\n\nSolvay's public policy activities include participation in industry and trade associations, as outlined in section 3.7. Membership of associations. We aim to conduct political relations and advocacy with our own staff resources, meaning that relevant contacts and meetings between Solvay and political stakeholders are made and held by Solvay representatives in person, and not by agency or partner staff acting on behalf of Solvay.\n\nThe Group does not take part in party political activities, nor do we make corporate donations to political parties or candidates. We engage in constructive debate with public authorities on subjects of legitimate interest to Solvay, where necessary, but only those employees specifically authorized to do so may carry out such activities.\n\nSolvay respects the freedom of our employees to make their own political decisions. Any personal participation or involvement by an employee in the political process must be done on an individual basis, on the employee's own time and at the employee's personal expense.\n\n## 3.2.5. Animal testing\n\nSolvay provides innovative products for a wide variety of uses and a large number of users. The Group must have a proper understanding of the hazards of our products in order to carry out our activities and protect users, the general public, Solvay personnel and the environment. With society continually pushing for new, better and safer chemicals and plastics, there is growing demand from both regulatory authorities and the public for product risk and hazard assessments. These require testing, both with and without the use of animals.\n\n## Testing\n\nTo comply with new and existing chemical regulations, or to further consolidate safety data, Solvay commissioned animal tests in 2022. Solvay avoids animal testing whenever possible, but in cases in which animal testing is required we commit to conducting studies that treat animals humanely, giving them the best care possible, and using all animals responsibly, with great regard for their welfare. In compliance with European cosmetic regulations, Solvay does not perform specific testing solely to support cosmetic uses.\n\n## Substance-based testing for multiple applications\n\nSolvay carries out tests required for all regulations and applications relating to a given substance just once. We avoid the need for new studies by actively advocating for the reuse of data from studies conducted within a given framework, such as REACH, for other registration systems.\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nSolvay's policy, outlined in the Solvay Animal Care and Use Procedure, is to apply the '3R principles' (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in each case and to comply with all applicable regulations. All of our studies comply with international standards, such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Regulatory studies are almost exclusively performed by laboratories accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). This worldwide organization sets quality standards for testing laboratories and ensures responsible and humane treatment of laboratory animals. Before they start, all studies commissioned by Solvay are subject to an ethical assessment at local or national level by the laboratory conducting the study.",

The remaining 4% were used to address additional product safety questions. In total, 5113 vertebrate animals (67% rats, 18% rabbits, 11% fish, 2% guinea pigs, 2% mice and 0.1% birds) were used. Solvay did not commission any studies on dogs, cats, pigs or non-human primates. Most vertebrate animals (89%) were used in tests required by the EU REACH Regulation, and these studies will also be valid for demonstrating compliance with chemical regulations elsewhere in the world. The number of vertebrate animals used in 2022 was half that of 2021.\n\n## Drivers for the future\n\nWhile studies are needed for regulatory and scientific purposes, Solvay continues to strengthen its capabilities and understanding of alternative methodologies that do not involve vertebrate animals.\n\nHowever, the higher tier animal studies requested by authorities, which required the largest number of animals in 2022, will remain the major driver for animal tests in the near future. A significantly higher number of these studies is already ongoing and it is therefore expected that the number of animals in 2023 will increase in comparison to 2022.\n\nAdvances in the implementation of non-animal methods and alternative hazard identification strategies are crucial in achieving a reduction in animal use for hazard assessment. For instance, the upcoming information requirements for nanomaterials and endocrine disruptors, appears to require more, rather than less, animal testing in Europe, and even more if existing studies are systematically challenged and have to be repeated.\n\n## 3.3.  Health, safety and environment management\n\nGRI DISCLOSURE 2-25 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 3, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15\n\n## 3.3.1. Definition\n\nSolvay's health, safety and environment (HSE) management system is aligned with ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 definitions and our Responsible Care Policy./uni00A0\n\nThrough our Responsible Care Policy, we commit to safeguarding people and the environment, by continuously improving our environmental, health and safety performance, the security of our facilities, processes, and technologies, and chemical product safety and stewardship throughout the supply chain. This reflects Solvay's position as a signatory to the ICCA's Responsible Care Global Charter\u00ae.\n\n## 3.3.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's HSE strategy relies on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 An approved HSE management system, which is implemented at every industrial (manufacturing, and research and innovation) site. This includes a Responsible Care Policy and a set of risk-based procedures that apply to all areas, including health monitoring, industrial hygiene, occupational safety, process safety, transport safety, and environment and product safety./uni00A0For each domain, a network is organized at Group level to ensure implementation of the procedures, compliance with regulations and sharing of good practice.\n- \u00b7 A Product Safety Management System (PSMS), applied in every Global Business Unit.\n- \u00b7 A safety culture approach, which ensures people's safety, health and well-being. It relies on a safety leadership style, where managers act as mentors and demonstrate genuine care for all.\n- \u00b7 A reporting process used to evaluate performance, analyze events, and define short- and long-term improvement plans./uni00A0",

SEC helps the sites and GBUs manage their environmental legacy, whether historical or recent, providing them with technical expertise and cash management through environmental provisions. Where the local regulations allow it, a risk-based approach is used to define management actions. For our operational sites, SEC collaborates with the local HSE team. Our closed sites are managed directly by the SEC team on behalf of the relevant GBU. SEC is also responsible and accountable for managing Group environmental provisions.\n\n## 3.3.3. Indicators\n\n## Approved HSE management systems at sites\n\nOf our 109 sites, 90% have a management system in place and have been audited by a third party in the past five years. Sites with fewer than ten people or that are not under Solvay's operational control are excluded.\n\nThree of our sites are certified by ISO 45001, 18 by the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Management System (ACC RCMS). Eighteen are certified by at least one of ISO 14001 and ACC RCMS 14001, and 54 are certified and have implemented both ISO 45001 and ISO/RC 14000 systems.\n\nTwenty-eight of our sites have another approved management system in place:\n\n- \u00b7 The Responsible Care Program by Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de la Industria Qu\u00edmica (ANIQ) in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The Responsible Care Program by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira da Ind\u00fastria Qu\u00edmica (ABIQUIM) in Brazil.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health management system (GB/T 33000-2016) in China.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration Voluntary Protection Programs (OSHA VPP management system) in the US.\n\nAt 12 of our sites, we plan to implement a management system by the end of 2023.\n\n## Regulatory Watch\n\nSolvay has installed a systematic process for monitoring regulation in all domains - health and safety, process safety, environment and transport safety - at 85% of our sites.\n\n## 3.4.

Definition\n\nSolvay Research and Innovation (R&I) is the Group's engine for delivering highly differentiated and valuable innovations that address major human challenges associated with resource scarcity, climate change and quality of life. Solvay wants to build a better future by developing innovative, profitable and sustainable solutions that turn science and chemistry into business and create value for the Group, our shareholders, our customers and all other stakeholders.\n\n## 3.4.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's G.R.O.W. strategy led to a redefinition of R&I priorities in 2020. Our priorities are now aligned with the ambitions and mandates of Solvay GBUs and Growth Platforms, taking into account their missions and strategic directions. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is in charge of all Group R&I activities and reports to the CEO. This evolved in 2022, through the strengthening of growth opportunities for the G (Growth) GBUs, and a strong reinforcement of efforts to develop new sustainable technologies for the R (Resilient) GBUs. This is fully aligned with the Group's strategic development, namely the separation into two different companies.\n\nThe main missions of the CTO are:\n\n- \u00b7 to define a vision for innovation and strategy that is aligned across the Group;\n- \u00b7 to drive Group R&I portfolio management and allocation of resources to maximize and accelerate value delivery;\n- \u00b7 to manage talent, efficiency and the implementation of transformational programs within the organization.",

Solvay also believes in the importance of working with academia, and with other companies or startups, to identify new solutions. In total, the Group currently manages more than 100 collaborative innovation projects.\n\nIn 2022, our main achievements in R&I are outlined below.\n\n## An important growth in sales of new products.\n\nNew product sales increased from \u20ac1.4 billion in 2021 to \u20ac1.75 billion in 2022, representing 13% of sales. This was driven mainly by volumes of new products, resulting from the redeployment of resources under the G.R.O.W. strategy. New products are those introduced less than five years ago.\n\n## A significant increase in the portfolio value\n\nThe increase in portfolio value was driven by our first three strategic growth platforms moving key projects into the pilot phase and sharing significant volumes of samples with customers. These growth platforms focus on batteries, green hydrogen and thermoplastic composites.\n\n## Significant progress in our strategic growth initiatives (Platforms)\n\nImportant steps were taken to advance our Battery Platform, with the inauguration of our two new pilots at our La Rochelle plant in France, one focused on solid state batteries, and the other on new sodium ion battery technology. We also launched an industrial pilot in China, focused on new solvent technology for high voltage electrolytes. These new technologies should start impacting businesses as soon as 2025.\n\nResearch and innovation for our Green Hydrogen Platform focused on enabling both the dramatically accelerating volume demand growth and the diversification of market technologies for the sustainable production, storage and end-usages of GH2. Solvay has been involved in designing new collaborative funded projects that are structuring the value chains for GH2 market technologies.\n\nTo consolidate its industrial infrastructure, the Thermoplastic Composite Platform brought a new world-class unidirectional tape plant fully on stream in Piedmont, South Carolina, and completed an expansion project at our Anaheim site in California. These industrial assets in the US and our MSAC customer engagement center in Brussels put Solvay in a strong position to support the fast growing aerospace and energy markets, as well as numerous other opportunities in several different segments. We also broadened our portfolio of unidirectional tapes, with the addition of tapes based on PPS, PPA and BioPA.\n\nThese three group strategic initiatives are well on track to deliver additional 3 B\u20ac growth for the group at the 2030 horizon.\n\n## Launch of a new strategic growth initiative focused on Renewable Materials and Biotechnology\n\nWe announced our Renewable Materials and Biotechnology (Biomattech) Platform in May 2022. It takes a holistic approach to innovation in the biospace, focusing on increasing the use of more renewable and sustainable raw materials, fostering the use of biotechnology combined with chemistry and accelerating our transition toward biodegradable-by-design solutions in non-durable chemicals like surfactants or water-soluble polymers. The platform aims to generate an additional \u20ac500 million in sales in 2030, coming from businesses associated with renewable resources, biotechnology and biodegradable solutions, paving the way for Solvay to develop safer chemicals, foster more environmentally-friendly solutions and enhance circularity.\n\n## Re-Inventing sustainability of our essential products\n\nWe took major innovation steps to transform our more traditional businesses, to make them more sustainable, leading the way in this field by establishing new developments for the future.\n\nOur soda ash business has engaged in the industrialization of a major new technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at our green river plant in the US, which will produce results as soon as 2024. We are also reinventing the initial Solvay process for soda ash manufacture, by introducing new electrochemistry technology that can significantly reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions for this process.",

We do this by:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing our collaboration with academia worldwide. We continue to be heavily involved in high-level scientific collaborations with top universities globally. These collaborations range from direct contracts to longer-term partnerships. In 2022, we reinforced our partnership with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba (AIST) through a scientist exchange agreement. We also reinforced our partnership in China with East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). Our strong involvement in science for the future can be seen in our award of the Solvay Prize to Katalin Kalicko, who is one of the key inventors of mRNA vaccine technology, and by the Nobel prize awarded to Carolyn Bertozzi, who received the Solvay Prize in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Using Solvay Ventures to strengthen our Key Account Management (KAM) activities, which focus on using external insights, such as identifying customer pain points and entrepreneurial solutions, by connecting directly to startups and creating joint development opportunities aligned with Solvay's focus areas. In 2022, we assessed more than 500 new start-ups in the fields of advanced materials and composites, electronics, biotechnology, green hydrogen, battery materials and chemical formulations. We added to our portfolio with investments in Plyable, a digital marketplace for composite tooling; 9T, which focuses on TPC additive manufacturing; Chengyang, which focuses on distributed electrochemical H 2 O 2 production; and Sofinnova, a late stage biotech venture capital fund. Equally significant for Solvay Ventures was the financial return received in 2022 from the sale of two portfolio companies, Kumovis and Solid Power. This complemented our strategic return, showing we can not only develop strong partners for Solvay, but also be self-sustaining through capital returns, building credibility with entrepreneurs and co-investors.\n\n## 3.5.

        "page_content": "## Core Suppliers\n\nSolvay applies supplier segmentation in order to identify key suppliers, which we refer to as Core Suppliers. Core Suppliers encompass three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic Alliances: strategic suppliers at Group level that contribute to Solvay's growth, market differentiation and innovation.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Partners: suppliers that deliver strategic materials or services to Solvay that can have a possible business impact.\n- \u00b7 Bottlenecks: suppliers that represent a high potential risk to Solvay or the business.\n\nThis approach enables Solvay to focus on managing performance, mitigating supply risk and improving relationships, while also forming the basis for collaboration and stimulating innovation.\n\nActions to be performed, such as carrying out a supplier evaluation survey, or requesting a mandatory third-party sustainability assessment, are defined according to the type of supplier. Key Account Managers are appointed for some of our Core Suppliers, allowing us to generate additional value and mitigate risk through strategic relationships. We have identified 410 suppliers as Core Suppliers. They account for 40% of Solvay spend and 92% of them are currently covered by a third party sustainability assessment.\n\n## Supplier Engagement Program\n\nWe launched our Supplier Engagement Program journey in 2021, with the aim of achieving common sustainability ambitions with our suppliers to create shared value for all. This continued into 2022, with a call to our suppliers to submit collaborative projects. More than 20 innovation projects were kicked off in 2022, focused on bio-based and recycled sourcing, energy and waste recovery, and decreasing the GHG emissions footprint across our supply chain.\n\n## Together for Sustainability initiative\n\nSolvay is a founding and Steering Committee member of Together for Sustainability (TfS), a global procurement-driven initiative that improves the sustainability performance of chemical companies and their suppliers.\n\nThe TfS program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care\u00ae principles./uni00A0It provides a framework and tools - TfS Assessments and TfS Audits - that enable TFS member companies to assess, drive and improve the sustainability performance of chemical supply chains through a shared infrastructure. TfS assessments are carried out by the initiative's key partner EcoVadis, a global service provider specialized in sustainability performance assessments. For audits, TfS cooperates with a tfs-approved audit company.\n\nIn 2022, TfS made significant progress in addressing the challenges of climate change and improving the sustainable supply chain knowledge of the chemical industry. This included addressing Scope 3 emissions. Together with members of TfS, we created the first Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Guidelines to enable chemical companies and our suppliers to share and develop high-quality carbon footprint data, which will be an essential tool to drive decarbonization initiatives in the industry. In 2022, Solvay used the PCF Guidelines to develop our own PCF software, which is currently at a pilot stage. We also called on our top suppliers to collect and share the product carbon footprint of the raw materials they supply.\n\nTfS also rolled out the TfS Academy which contains over 335 exclusive and tailored capability-building contents in multiple languages. Membership in TfS grew to 40 in 2022, with the addition of five European, one Chinese and one Japanese member companies during the period. This increased the reach and impact on the sustainability performance of chemical supply chains, covering over \u20ac400 billion of combined spend.\n\n## ESG risk in the Supply Chain\n\nTo tackle human rights and environmental impacts across our value chains and to comply with the dynamic regulatory landscape, Solvay has developed an ESG risk management approach for our supply chain. It provides a systematic approach for risk identification and risk severity assessment for more than 62 upstream value chains, and triggers risk mitigation action plans. Thanks to our due diligence process, 12 suppliers conducted a TfS audit in 2022 and 2,250 suppliers performed an Ecovadis assessment.\n\n## Supplier Code of Business Integrity\n\nOur Supplier Code of Business Integrity is key for the implementation of our Responsible Procurement Policy. It is fully aligned with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity and inspired by the UN Global Compact principles and Responsible Care\u00ae practices.\n\nAll written procurement contracts must make reference to the Supplier Code of Business Integrity or an acceptable alternative. Suppliers or partners are invited to report any breach of Solvay's ethical policies or Supplier Code of Business Integrity through the Solvay Ethics Helpline. Every report will be carefully reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance team, who review the case and conduct an investigation as appropriate.\n\nSolvay is concerned that the trade in tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, and the metals known as 3TGs that are refined from such minerals and mined in certain conflict-affected and high-risk regions, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, may be contributing to human rights abuses. We are continuously working to improve our overview on 3TGs included in products, components and materials supplied to Solvay.\n\nWe continue to work to verify the integrity of our sourcing, and to support the actions of governments, our customers and suppliers toward achieving this aim globally. If our suppliers fail to meet our expectations in this regard, we will take these factors into consideration when making future business and sourcing decisions.",

Association of International Chemical Manufacturers\n\nThe Association of International Chemical Manufacturers (AICM) represents nearly 70 major multinational companies in the Chinese chemical industry active in the manufacture, transportation, distribution and disposal of chemicals. Together with other leading international chemical players in China, Solvay helps promote Responsible Care\u00ae and other globally-recognized chemical management principles among all stakeholders, advocates costeffective, science- and risk-based policies to policymakers, and strengthens the contributions made by the chemical industry to the economy./uni00A0In 2022, Solvay actively promoted the rational implementation of environmental protection and safety administration regulations in AICM, with a focus on achieving clarification for the industry development balance while respecting the spirit of the Yangtze River Protection Law.\n\n## 3.7.10.  BusinessEurope\n\nBusinessEurope is the leading European business trade association. Its direct members are national business federations, but selected companies may participate in BusinessEurope through the Advisory and Support Group (ASG). BusinessEurope and its members campaign on the issues that most influence the business performance and growth of European companies, in Europe and globally. Solvay provides input through participation in working groups dealing with energy, environment and research, as well as trade policy. Solvay's position on climate is more ambitious than the federation position.\n\n## 3.7.11.  European Round Table of Industrialists\n\nThe European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) is a forum that brings together around 50 CEOs of European companies. Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri is a member of the Steering Committee of the ERT. Among its activities, the ERT advocates policies to improve European competitiveness, growth and employment. In particular, Solvay actively participates in the working groups dealing with energy, trade, competitiveness and innovation, jobs and skills, and finance, as well as competition policies. Solvay CFO Karim Hajjar is a member of the ERT Finance Task Force, and sustainable finance is a key part of the agenda. In 2022, Solvay focused in particular on promoting the human skills agenda, supporting the creation of new jobs through the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\n## 3.7.12.  World Business Council for Sustainable Development\n\nThe World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. Solvay has been  an active member since 2010, and Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri is personally involved. In 2021, the WBCSD appointed Ilham Kadri as its new executive committee chair. She is the WBCSD's first female chair in its 26-year history. Solvay CFO Karim Hajjar serves as co-chair of the Redefining Value Program. Solvay plays an active role in four of the six programs:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefining Value Program: Redefining Value helps companies measure and manage risk, gain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities by understanding environmental, social and governance (ESG) information. By building collaborations and developing tools, guidance, case studies, engagement and education opportunities to help companies incorporate ESG performance into mainstream business and finance systems, the ultimate goal is to improve decision-making and external disclosure, eventually transforming the financial system so that it rewards the most sustainable companies.\n- \u00b7 Circular Economy: The future of business is circular, and there's no room for waste in it. Factor 10, the WBCSD's circular economy program, brings circularity into the heart of business leadership and practice. It builds a critical mass of engagement within and across businesses to spur the circular economy to deliver and scale the solutions needed to build a sustainable world.\n- \u00b7 Climate and Energy: Combating climate change and transforming the energy system are core challenges on the path to a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. The Paris Agreement has sent a decisive and global signal that the start of the transition to a thriving, clean economy is inevitable, irreversible and irresistible. The WBCSD Climate and Energy Program facilitates interaction on cutting-edge climate and energy topics between WBCSD members, their peers and stakeholders as they address critical industry issues and share best practice and solutions.\n- \u00b7 People: Our current society is characterized by a range of dynamic shifts and evolutions. We are faced with a world that is polarizing, a world that presents risks and opportunities in the way we work, a world that is on the move and a world in which people are living beyond their means. The People program provides solutions that support companies by ensuring that they remain in tune with the needs, rights, goals and aspirations of society against the backdrop of this rapidly evolving landscape.\n- \u00b7 Solvay also plays an active role in the WBCSD Chemicals Group. Together with leading chemical company members, ACC and Cefic published the SDG Roadmap for the Chemical Sector in 2018. This methodology provides clear guidance on how the chemical sector can contribute to change across the spectrum of the SDGs, unlocking their value by acting on key impact opportunities. Notably, Solvay works proactively to accelerate adoption of our Sustainable Portfolio Management system across the chemical industry and other sectors.",

        "page_content": "## 3.8.  Climate risks analysis\n\n## 3.8.1. Transition risks\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nIn 2022, we revised our scenario analysis under the following scope:\n\n- \u00b7 Transition risks.\n- \u00b7 Focusing on the three most exposed business units, based on total emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) and exposure to climate sensitive markets, like automotive and buildings: Soda Ash, Specialty Polymers and Novecare. These three GBUs represent 52% of Solvay's 2021 sales.\n- \u00b7 Two International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios: 1.5\u00b0C Scenario (IEA Net Zero Emissions Scenario 2021) and 3\u00b0C Scenario (IEA Stated Policy Scenario 2021).\n- \u00b7 Using a leading audit, tax and consulting services company's tool for climate scenario analyses.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions of price and cost changes, volume changes and adaptation potential (cost pass-through) were taken from the consultant's models. This included price trajectories up to 2050 for oil, coal, gas, CO2, electricity and energy usage in transport, in our own operations and upstream.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the market dynamics and identification of the essential characteristics of individual sites was based on the consultant and Solvay sector and climate expertise, considering products sold in main markets, namely construction, packaging, automotive, oil and gas, home and personal care, food and feed, and electronics.\n\nThe main conclusions of the scenario analysis were:\n\n- \u00b7 The soda ash business relies highly on a competitive price advantage. Since prices for raw materials and our own operations will increase in a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the scenario analysis concluded that, in the absence of cost pass-through measures, the contribution margin could decrease by up to 16%, while additional demand for glass for energy efficient buildings would drive overall profit and sales. Sales could increase to \u20ac2.4 billion in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and to \u20ac2.1 billion in the 3\u00b0C scenario, by 2050.\n- \u00b7 The specialty polymers business has the most significant opportunities in a 1.5\u00b0C world. Products are expensive and resilient to cost increases and the demand for most customer segments would increase. Focusing on increasing production capacities for this GBU should be prioritized in a 1.5\u00b0C world. Sales could increase to \u20ac4.7 billion in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and to \u20ac4.3 billion in the 3\u00b0C scenario, by 2050.\n- \u00b7 Novecare faces risks relating to vegetable oil imports. This is because vegetable oils from palm oil and other alternatives are highly CO 2 emissions and water intensive. Shifting to sustainable alternatives is expensive, but it may result in a reputation boost for Solvay and decrease costs for these alternatives in the long run. Novecare has the highest weighted CO 2 intensity in their supply chain. This should be monitored and suppliers should be engaged to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Sales could increase to \u20ac2 billion by 2050 in both scenarios.\n\nAs stated by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in their Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020), 'scenario analysis helps companies in making strategic and risk management decisions under complex and uncertain conditions such as climate change. It allows a company to understand the risks and uncertainties it may face under different hypothetical futures and how those conditions may affect its performance, thus contributing to the development of greater strategy resilience and flexibility'. Actual results or future events may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such analysis.\n\nExamples of actions decided upon to manage the risks and opportunities identified by the scenario analysis include:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost pass-through measures, which have already been implemented, as demonstrated by the resilience of Solvay's financial results during the 2022 energy crisis.\n- \u00b7 Solvay's announcement in February 2022 of a PVDF capacity investment in Europe to meet growing EV battery demand. The \u20ac300 million investment supports a fully integrated and digitalized PVDF operation and will increase capacity at Solvay's site in Tavaux, France to 35 kilotons, making it the largest PVDF production site in Europe.\n- \u00b7 Solvay's announcement in June 2022 that our Changshu site had significantly increased production capacity for Solef\u00ae PVDF, demonstrating the Group's commitment to meeting the needs of customers worldwide. The Group has now more than doubled the onsite production volume of our high-performance polymer Solef\u00ae polyvinylidene fluoride since mid-May 2022.\n- \u00b7 Solvay and Orbia's announcement in November 2022 that they are creating a Joint Venture in North America to supply critical materials to the battery market. The joint venture will create the largest PVDF production facility for battery materials in the region. The total investment is estimated at around $850 million, partially funded by a grant to Solvay from the US Department of Energy totaling $178 million.\n\n## Product and market related risks\n\nThe Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) global and systematic assessment helps alert our businesses to sustainability market signals, in particular on climate risk and opportunities, to anticipate their impact and develop the right answers in a timely manner. SPM is a robust, fact-based, futureoriented compass that allows us to take a snapshot of products' sustainability risks and opportunities in their business environment.\n\nSPM informs us about the contribution Solvay's products make to sustainability along the value chain considering both:\n\n- \u00b7 their environmental manufacturing footprint and the associated risks and opportunities - vertical axis - with a quantitative assessment using 21 impact indicators;\n- \u00b7 how their applications bring benefits or face challenges from a holistic market perspective - horizontal axis - with a qualitative assessment of social and environmental topics covering four main themes, namely health and safety, climate change, resources and opinion leaders.\n\nFor more details about SPM, see section 5.1 Product design and life cycle management and the SPM guide published on Solvay's website.",

        "page_content": "Climate change is one of the focus areas for SPM assessment. This involves identifying if a product in a given application brings a climate change benefit or challenge. Product-Application Combinations (PACs) that lead to benefits are identified as \"climate solutions\", while those that pose challenges are considered \"climate challenges\".\n\nSolvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management tool classifies a sustainable solution as a product in a given application that makes a significant climate change contribution to the customer's performance while also demonstrating a lower carbon impact in its production phase. In 2022, sales from \"climate solutions\" reached \u20ac2.5 billion.\n\nThe SPM methodology is also used to identify eligible enabling activities, requested under the Taxonomy's Delegated Act 2021. For more details about Taxonomy reporting, see section 5.1 Product design and life cycle management in the section EU Taxonomy Eligible Activities.\n\nSPM is a key tool for enabling Solvay to integrate the sustainability dimension into strategic and operational decision making in key business processes, such as strategy, research and innovation, investment, marketing and sales, and mergers and acquisitions. We also apply the SPM tool to strategic projects, using the same logic as for our portfolio, to make sure that these projects are heading toward business solutions that support growth and value creation. This makes SPM a key tool for Solvay to identify if an investment, or a strategic or innovation project can be considered a climate transition opportunity for Solvay.\n\n## 3.8.2. Physical risks\n\n## Acute\n\nSolvay sites in areas exposed to natural hazards, with loss expectancy, calculated by our insurers, of higher than \u20ac10 million (physical damage and contribution margin loss):\n\n- \u00b7 Eight Solvay sites in 100-year frequency (2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of \u20ac13.7-178 million: Marietta, US; Bernburg, Germany; Gunsan, South Korea; Orange Texas, USA; Winona, US; Paulinia, Brazil; Santo Andr\u00e9, Brazil; and Torrelavega, Spain.\n- \u00b7 Sixteen Solvay sites in 500-year frequency (0.2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of \u20ac10.3-220.7 million: Willow Island, USA; Lock Haven, USA; Pasadena, USA; Alorton, US; Gunsan, South Korea; Dombasle, France; Marietta, US; Bernburg, Germany; Winona, US; Anaheim, US; Orange Texas, US; Santo Andr\u00e9, Brazil; Rheinberg, Germany; Paulinia, Brazil; Changsu, China; and Torrelavega, Spain.\n- \u00b7 Three sites in a wind exposed area, with a loss expectancy range of \u20ac11-14.5 million: Orange Texas, US; Anan, Japan); and Baton Rouge, US.\n- \u00b7 Solvay has a property damage and business interruption insurance program in place to cover catastrophic risks, and covers smaller losses through self-insurance.\n- \u00b7 The flood risk materialized into \u20ac3 million in losses at the Torrelavega site in 2008. The freeze risk materialized during the 2021 Texas deep freeze event, which impacted 25 Solvay sites and led to \u20ac10 million in total losses.\n- \u00b7 The risk is continually assessed throughout the year, with the support of Solvay's Property insurer FM Global and reinsurers, like Swiss Re, based on their proprietary flood modeling. Each site with reported insured values greater than \u20ac50 million is visited by FM Global loss prevention engineers and benchmarked with FM Global's resilience index, which takes into account inherent risks and completion of any recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Based on FM Global's benchmarking, Solvay Corporate Insurance and Prevention proposed an action plan to improve risks to the Executive Leadership Team. In 2021, the Executive Leadership Team decided that all sites should reach a minimum of 75% on the Resilience Index by 2025. Each site has received a list of recommendations to complete that will enable them to achieve this objective. Recommendations can be related to procedural improvements, like developing a flood, freeze, wind or earthquake emergency response plan, or physical improvements, like installing flood barriers, or improving levees or earthquake emergency shutdown valves.\n- \u00b7 This Business Resiliency Action Plan has already been successful in some areas. During Hurricane Harvey in the US, for example, ten Solvay sites were exposed to flooding but the loss was lower than \u20ac1 million in total. Our Deer Park site in Texas is located on an industrial site that suffered very significant losses of more than \u20ac100 million and weeks of downtime, but due to its preparedness and emergency response plan the Solvay site only experienced very minor damage, amounting to \u20ac250,000 and a short turnaround period. Torrelavega has also finished a project to improve their flood levee, mitigating the 100-year (2% chance per year) flood risk at this location. The loss expectancy will be updated after we perform a new hydraulic flood analysis to validate this improvement.\n\n## Chronic\n\nSolvay updated our analysis of water scarcity risks in 2019, classed as a chronic climate-related physical risk. To do this we used the database from Hoekstra et al. (2016), in conjunction with QGIS, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System.\n\nThirty-one Solvay sites are located in areas subject to hydric stress. Eight of these have been identified as having a high business impact. The highest annual business interruption value is \u20ac400 million.\n\nOf our 138 production sites, 31 (22.5%) are in areas subject to water stress. These sites withdraw a total of 29 million cubic meters of water, out of a total of 314 million cubic meters (9.2%) withdrawn by Solvay sites.\n\nEight sites have been prioritized based on a risk analysis combining three criteria: location; freshwater intake; and business interruption value. These sites are: Chao Phraya, Thailand; Chicago Heights, US; Melle, France; Green River, US; Qingdao, China; Devnya, Bulgaria; Spinetta Marengo, Italy; and Bernburg, Germany.",

Definitions\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 305-1 305-2 305-3 305-4 305-5 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 13 14 15\n\nSolvay uses the following references to address greenhouse gas emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 the Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) in the Chemical Sector Value Chain published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development;\n- \u00b7 the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard;\n- \u00b7 the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.\n\nTo better reflect our sustainability policy, we decided to use the market-based method to calculate CO 2 emissions associated with purchased electricity (Scope 2). To comply with Global Reporting Initiative requirements, we apply the following criteria, listed in decreasing order of priority, when selecting the CO 2 emission factor of each electricity supply contract:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy attribute certificates: emission factors resulting from specific instruments, such as green energy certificates.\n- \u00b7 Contract-based: the emission factor obtained from contract agreements on specific sources for which there is no emission of specific attributes.\n- \u00b7 Supplier or utility emission rates: the emission factor disclosed as a result of the supplier's retail mix.\n- \u00b7 Residual mix: if a residual mix is unavailable, grid-average emission factors are used as a proxy.\n\nLocation-based: if none of the above factors are available, we use the national emission factor published by national authorities or the International Energy Agency. Based on a World Resources Institute (WRI) recommendation, Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) emission factors published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency are used for the US, instead of the state emission factor. Similarly, grid emission factors published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment are used for China, instead of the state emission factors.\n\n## 4.1.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay has a 2030 objective to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory and targets carbon neutrality before 2050. Solvay will also not build new coal-powered plants and has committed to phasing out the use of solid fuels (coal and petcoke) in energy production by 2030 wherever renewable alternatives exist. In 2022, Solvay has set a 2030 target to reduce by 24% Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions emissions from its top five categories both upstream and downstream in the value chain and representing 90% of the total Scope 3. Early 2023, the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has validated the Solvay 2030 targets with a slight adjustment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 31%.\n\nTo achieve our targets, we are taking a range of different actions. This includes transforming our energy mix and investing in clean technologies. We are developing a growing pipeline of energy climate transition opportunities through collaborations between a dedicated team of experts in energy transition and operational teams at our industrial sites. We're also accelerating energy efficiency initiatives within our plants through our STAR Factory program. For greenhouse gas emissions not related to energy, specific task forces have been set up with strong technical support in order to help them develop the required clean technologies. In addition, Solvay applies an internal carbon price of \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 to all greenhouse gas emissions in our capital investment decisions worldwide./uni00A0\n\nAn externally verified greenhouse gas emission reporting system, and responses to rating agencies such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, help the Group align our efforts with the magnitude of the greenhouse gas challenges we face.",

Purchased goods and services: we carry out a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for most of our products, representing 94% of our total turnover. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are extrapolated to reach the totality of our purchases. They include all emissions related to raw material extraction and precursor processing, indirect emissions from energy use for these operations, and transport between suppliers and to our plants.\n\nNote: some Scope 3 subcategories are calculated by difference between on one hand cradle to gate emissions of products and on the other hand with the Scope 1, Scope 2, and emissions related to the fuel and energy-related activities of the industrial sites. We have identified that the methodology, combining life cycle assessments based on yearly averages and Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on primary data, is limited in accuracy when Scope 1 and 2 emissions make up a high share of cradle-to-gate assessments and when a high share of the energy produced in some plants is sold to third parties. We estimate that the level of the related uncertainty from the methodology affects particularly the subcategories of emissions related to purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution and waste generated in operations. Solvay is working on an alignment of its methodology to the Guideline developed under the Scope 3 GHG emissions program of Together for Sustainability and released in September 2022. It will address the identified limitation in accuracy and allow to rely more on primary data than on generic emissions factors.\n\n- 2.  Capital goods: we have used the emission factors of the WBCSD Guidance for Accounting & Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain, assuming that capital goods are a mix of concrete and steel.",

Upstream transportation and distribution: this is included in category 1 (see above), purchased goods and services.\n- 5. Waste generated in operations: this is included in category 1 (see above).\n- 6.  Business travel: business travel undertaken by Solvay employees is recorded by our travel agency and monitored by our purchasing department. For air and rail travel, travel mileage is recorded. This covers more than 95% of our air and rail travel. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are extrapolated to represent the totality of our travel. For each transportation mode, mileage is converted into CO 2 equivalent using emission factors from ecoInvent.\n- 7.  Employee commuting: the estimation is based on assuming that all employees commute every day in an average diesel or petrol car.\n- 8. Upstream leased assets: this is not applicable as we have no upstream leased assets.\n- 9.  Downstream transportation and distribution: greenhouse gas emission during transportation of our products from our plants to our customers are reported and monitored by our supply chain excellence department. Emissions factors from the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) are used to calculate total emissions.\n- 10.  Processing of sold products; 11. Use of sold products; and 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products: the computation principles for these three categories are the same.The emissions due to product processing and transformation by third parties subsequent to sale by Solvay are calculated according to product chemical composition and expected chemical reactions likely to generate emissions during the transformation, the usage and end-of-life of our product.\n- 13.  Downstream leased assets: this is not applicable as Solvay has no leased assets.\n- 14. Franchises: This is not applicable as Solvay has no franchises.\n- 15.  Investments: Scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-consolidated entities (that are not consolidated in Solvay's Scope 1 and 2) are reported according to Solvay's financial interest in these entities, to ensure consistency with our financial statements.\n\n## 4.1.4. Key achievements/uni00A0\n\nAt Solvay's Spinetta site in Italy, an innovative clean technology developed in-house and commissioned in 2019 with further add-ons led to a decrease of 1.1 Mt CO 2 eq in CF4 emissions in 2022, compared to 2018.\n\nAt our Rheinberg plant in Germany, a first biomass boiler was commissioned to replace coal firing in 2021, reaching full capacity in 2022.\n\nAt our Green River plant in the US, process equipment allowed us to replace coal with natural gas in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, 63 of our sites sourced a share of their electricity supply from renewable energy, such as solar or wind. This represents an additional saving of 0.28 Mt CO 2 eq compared to 2021.\n\n## 4.2.  Energy\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 302-1 302-2 302-3 302-4 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 7 13\n\n## 4.2.1.

Key achievements\n\nIn 2022, we accelerated our shift to renewable energy sources. In China, 100% of our operations are now supplied by renewable electricity. In the US, 34/uni00A0of our manufacturing sites are now fully supplied by green electricity, covering the needs of six GBUs. We continued to ramp-up renewable electricity purchases for the third consecutive year, with an additional impact of 2.3 PJ in 2022.\n\nIn Europe, the biomass boiler at our Rheinberg plant in Germany reached its full potential in 2022.\n\nWith the energy crisis, a significant effort was made to improve energy efficiency in 2022. This led to the worldwide deployment of workshops on energy efficiency at our sites, the creation of a common database gathering all opportunities and the prioritization of projects to be implemented. Within one of our GBUs, we delivered a 7 ktCO 2 reduction, resulting from improvements in technologies. In another GBU, we performed steam trap surveys to assess steam leakages and replace dysfunctional equipment. We also rolled out onsite squads to perform energy walkthrough audits and identify energy savings. At one of our plants, we optimized regulation on a natural gas boiler, leading to better electricity consumption efficiency and a CO2 reduction of 0.5kt per year.\n\nIn France, one of our sites consumed 119 GWh of biogas, reducing CO 2 emission by 22 ktCO 2 per year.\n\n## 4.3.

        "page_content": "The calculation of the Solvay Group's pressure on biodiversity is performed along the value chain, from cradle-to-gate (from resource extraction to the factory gate, before it is transported to the consumer), for our entire portfolio of products. This is a global approach that is based on a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology: the ReCiPe2016 method. This method translates emissions and resource extractions into a limited number of environmental impact scores through what are known as characterization factors.\n\nThe first step in this method is using emissions from environmental reporting that are linked with the following 'midpoint impact categories':\n\n- \u00b7 global warming, from CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions, for example;\n- \u00b7 water use;\n- \u00b7 freshwater ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 freshwater eutrophication;\n- \u00b7 ozone formation;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial acidification;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 marine ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 land use.\n\nThe potential damage to nature is calculated by connecting the midpoint indicator with an endpoint factor, such as damage to freshwater, marine or terrestrial species and natural resources. The unit for measuring ecosystem quality is local relative species loss in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, respectively, measured over space and time.\n\n## 4.3.2. Management approach\n\n## Local biodiversity\n\nWe screened 185 operational sites with both the IBAT and WWF tools to assess their biodiversity risks.\n\nOn the basis of the results of these analyses, and considering other criteria such as climate change, environmental impact and strategic dimensions, we prioritized 30 sites for which to develop a biodiversity roadmap. The first step in the development of the roadmap is to identify a vision for the site based on the long-term goals we want to achieve. The second step is to identify all possible actions that would support nature conservation and the restoration of biodiversity. This involves identifying all of the stakeholders involved in each action, such as employees, local communities, nature conservation associations and universities, as well as defining a timeline, indicators and a budget to complete each action. The final step is to prioritize the actions, planification and governance allocation.\n\nThe local assessment of the biodiversity-related risks related to Solvay's operations is fully integrated into the STAR Factory program. All sites involved in STAR Factory are developing a biodiversity roadmap as part of the sustainability workstream of the program.\n\n## Global biodiversity\n\nAs part of Solvay One Planet, we set a target to reduce our pressure on biodiversity by 30% by 2030, as compared to 2018. Using the environmental profiles of our products, and looking at their life cycle from raw materials to the gate of our manufacturing sites, we were able to identify the areas of our portfolio that put the most pressure on biodiversity. We found that greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and soil acidification represent 90% of the drivers affecting biodiversity.\n\nAs part of our efforts to contribute to biodiversity preservation, Solvay joined the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations' Business for Biodiversity (B4B+) interest group, which is working on an international Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) as part of a European initiative./uni00A0Solvay is also a founding member of Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE), which was created in 1992. This is a think-tank and platform for expertise, bringing together around 60 large French and international companies from all sectors of the economy to work together to better integrate the environment into both their strategies and their day-to-day management. Within the EpE, Solvay is an active member of the Commission on Biodiversity.\n\n## 4.3.3. Indicators\n\n## Local biodiversity\n\nAssessing our 185 operational sites for biodiversity risks using the IBAT and WWF tools revealed that:\n\n- \u00b7 112 of the 185 sites (59%) were within 5km of a protected area;\n- \u00b7 48 of the 185 sites (25%) were within 5km of a Key Biodiversity Area;\n- \u00b7 more than 15,000 vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species are potentially present within 50km of our sites",

        "page_content": "Our baseline pressure on biodiversity, from 2018, was 122 species potentially affected. The results for 2022 show that we have decreased our pressure on biodiversity by 28%. While new data from suppliers and manufacturing sites, like the source of energy, impacted the calculation of the global pressure on biodiversity, the main driver of the progress in 2022 is a decrease of the volume of sales.\n\n## 4.3.4. Key achievements\n\nOur Paulinia site in Brazil was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's (WHC) Gold Certificate in 2021. This is the highest level of certification awarded by the WHC, which is an international organization that promotes biodiversity conservation practices in the private sector. Following several decades of work to promote harmonious coexistence with nature, the site has become a hub for wildlife in the region. The certification has given the site a boost to continue increasing biodiversity protection and restoration. In 2022, a biologist was hired to conduct two inventories of species. These inventories led to the identification of 183 native fauna species, including reptiles, amphibians, insects, mammals and birds. Endangered species were also identified, allowing us to plan conservation actions. For example, the puma which was specifically studied in order to help us protect its habitat.\n\nOur efforts to restore the Cuchia Quarry in Spain also received recognition in 2021. The project won the European Council of Chemical Industry Federations (Cefic) award for ecosystem preservation. The quarry supplied our site in Torrelavega with limestone for almost 80 years - from 1927 to 2006. Restoration efforts have been underway for the last 30 years, including when the quarry was still in operation.\n\nBiodiversity roadmap development and implementation has progressed well at two other sites: Oldbury and Rosignano.\n\nAt Oldbury, a UK site located in the center of the urban West Midlands, the biodiversity roadmap has various objectives: to green several areas after dismantling operations; to create suitable habitats connected with surrounding nature corridors; and to connect the site with local communities. The commitment of the site manager has enabled the site to implement several projects, with the support of local universities and scientists. In Spring 2022, over fifty four-meter-tall trees were planted along the site's principal avenue to create a nature corridor and provide shade for employees. To complement this, 300 spring bulbs were then planted in the fall. The planting of the trees and bulbs was a site-wide effort organized by the Site Biodiversity Group. In addition to this, the site carried out tree thinning in a small wooded area in early 2022, and installed bird boxes, bug and hedgehog houses, along with wildlife cameras to monitor the visitors. Since then, foxes, squirrels, many birds - some of which have nested in the bird boxes - and even sparrow hawks have been spotted.\n\nOther actions taken by the site to protect resources included giving new life to old, disused, textile equipment and transporting some extremely large machinery to Bangladesh where it is now running for the first time in many years in a textile mill.\n\nOur Rosignano site is located in the Tuscany region of Italy. Its biodiversity roadmap includes 35 different actions, with a total budget estimated at \u20ac5/uni00A0million. Implementation of the roadmap started with several projects on the site and its surroundings.\n\nA lake was built in the 1960s to provide water to the plant and has since become a natural reserve. Now certified as a 'Natura 2000' protected area, the reserve is also used for educational and scientific projects, including studies by the LIPU bird protection association. The reserve is fully connected with the local community in Santa Luce, which recognizes the importance of this reserve for economic, environmental and social activities.\n\nThe project was recognized as a 'Nature-based Solution' - defined as a project providing environmental, economic and social benefits - by the IUCN, in December 2022. We also presented the projects in Brazil, Spain and Italy, as well as Solvay's strategy on biodiversity, during a workshop organized by the IUCN as part of the COP 15 UN Biodiversity Conference in December 2022. Steve Edwards, IUCN Senior Programme Manager, Enterprise and Investment team, Centre for Economy and Finance testified to Solvay's commitment in biodiversity protection:\n\n'During the recent CBD COP in Montreal, we were really pleased to hear about successful conservation and restoration efforts from Solvay and others that go beyond regulatory requirements. We are hopeful that the company will show leadership in conserving nature in the coming years.'\n\nThe conference COP15 ended with the adoption of the 'Global Biodiversity Framework', an ambitious programme of targets and recommendations relating to biodiversity conservation and restoration. The private sector was included in negotiations and Solvay signed the resulting 'Make it mandatory' pledge, which requires businesses to measure and report on their impact and dependency on nature.",

Definitions\n\nSolvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management focuses on sustainable business solutions. The SPM methodology is designed to boost Solvay's business performance and deliver higher growth, by letting decisionmakers know how our products contribute to sustainability with regard to two factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The environmental footprint related to their production and associated risks and opportunities, based on cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments (from resource extraction to the factory gate, before it is transported to the consumer).\n- \u00b7 How their applications create benefits or challenges from a market perspective, based on a qualitative assessment using a cradle-to-cradle scope.\n\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for compiling inputs and outputs, along with an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle. LCA methodologies follow international standards, namely ISO 14040, ISO 14044 and ISO 14046 norms.\n\nA sustainable solution is defined by Solvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management tool as a product in a given application that makes a greater social and environmental contribution to the customer's performance and, at the same time, demonstrates a lower environmental impact in its production phase.\n\n## 5.1.2. Management approach\n\nSPM assessments are performed every year in order to capture the most recent signals from the market and cover more than 80% of Group revenue. Since its implementation in 2009, the Sustainable Portfolio Management tool has been widely adopted by Solvay Global Business Units and Functions to integrate sustainability into their key processes:\n\n- \u00b7 The Sustainable Portfolio Management profile is an integral part of strategic discussions between Global Business Units and the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 The SPM tool is used to evaluate merger and acquisition projects, to determine whether an investment is feasible in light of Sustainable Portfolio targets.\n- \u00b7 Investment decisions (capital expenditure above \u20ac10 million and acquisitions) made by the Executive Committee or the Board of Directors include a sustainability aspect that involves an exhaustive SPM analysis of the potential investment.\n- \u00b7 All research and innovation projects are evaluated using SPM.\n- \u00b7 SPM is used in marketing and sales to engage customers on fact-based sustainability topics, such as climate change action, renewable energy, recycling and air quality, with the goal of differentiating and creating value for Solvay and the customer.\n\nSolvay Life Cycle Assessments are managed by a dedicated corporate team with direct links to all business units and services. Having a dedicated LCA team makes it possible to maintain a high level of staff competency and coordinate updates of the main methodologies used based on best practice. Core LCA activity is based on recognized tools, software and databases, and we also have our own database, specific to Solvay business and innovation segments, in material science or battery development for instance.\n\nThe LCA team is also called upon to support business activity concerning customer relations, by sharing environmental and LCA data on products to enhance understanding and environmental impact assessments along the value chain, from cradle to grave or recycling. Examples include the automotive sector, the construction sector and Product Carbon Footprint declarations for our customers.\n\n## Taking part in world class Life Cycle Assessment platforms\n\nTo maintain a high level of LCA expertise, we participate in the following collaborative platforms:\n\n- \u00b7 International Reference Centre for the Life Cycle of Products, Processes and Services (CIRAIG): Solvay joined CIRAIG in 2012 as an industrial partner, ensuring access to high level research and expertise on Life Cycle Assessment methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Association Chimie du V\u00e9g\u00e9tal: Solvay is a member of this association in France focused on the use of bio-sourced materials in chemistry.\n- \u00b7 SCORE Life Cycle Assessment platform: this platform was created in March 2012 to promote collaboration between industrial, institutional and scientific actors, and to foster positive developments in environmental quantification methods, particularly in Life Cycle Assessments, to be shared and recognized at European and international levels.\n- \u00b7 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): Solvay takes part in Life Cycle Assessment projects and Product Carbon Footprint working groups organized by the WBCSD.\n- \u00b7 Roundtable for Product Social Metrics: this association of industry representatives and consultants establishes guidelines for assessing the social impacts of industrial product life cycles.",

Indicators\n\nIn 2022, extensive cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments were performed for 94% of our products, by turnover share, placed on the market, as compared to 96% in 2021. Solvay's LCA team manages a product database representing more than 1,300 different chemicals and materials, which is continuously updated to include the most recent industrial or innovation data. As set out in our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap, we will continue to shift our portfolio toward opportunities that grow our sustainable solutions, with a target of increasing sustainable solutions to 65% of total Group sales by 2030.\n\n## ReVeNue BReAKDoWN BY sPM HeAT MAP cATeGoRIes\n\n|               | Units   |   2022 | 2021   |   2020 |\n|---------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Solutions     | %       |     55 | 50     |     52 |\n| Potentials    | %       |     11 | 28     |     27 |\n| Transitions   | %       |     16 |        |     27 |\n| Challenges    | %       |      7 | 9      |      8 |\n| Not evaluated | %       |     11 | 10     |     13 |\n\nIn 2022, the proportion of sales from sustainable solutions improved by five percentage points, largely due to the organic growth in the automotive and battery market with Specialty Polymers and Silica, in the agro market with Novecare, in air and water treatments with Peroxides and Soda Ash, and better market alignment of our solutions toward sustainability with Novecare, Aroma and Technology Solutions. Effective 2022, the CO 2 reference price was increased from \u20ac75 to \u20ac100 per metric ton CO 2 eq. As a consequence, the value for 2021 has been restated to 50%.\n\nWe substitute the Neutral category by two new categories: Transitions and Potentials. The Potentials category mirrors the potential to join the Solutions category by acting on the manufacturing environmental footprint which do not have negative nor outstanding sustainability performance, if any. These are products that consumers need, but which environmental footprint can be improved. The Transitions category identifies low negative sustainability.\n\nStarting in 2023, the evolution of the increase or decrease in sustainable solutions in percentage of group sales is split between operational performance, changes in methodology and new ESG material risks. Operational performance measures progress from operational vulnerability, organic growth in sustainable solutions and new sustainable solutions. New ESG material risks covers the evolution of the sustainable solutions score as a result of new external material market signals or adaptations to regulation taken into account in SPM assessments. Changes in methodology refers to the evolution of new standards for ecoprofiles and changes in shadow costs.\n\nIn 2022, the proportion of sales from sustainable solutions improved by 4.5% (from 50.3% to 54.8%). This increase is accounted for as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Operational Performance: +4.5%\n- \u00b7 New ESG Material risks: 0%\n- \u00b7 Changes in methodology: 0%\n\n## sPM soluTIoNs: sAles BY MAIN IMPAcT cATeGoRY\n\n|                           | Units     |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Climate                   | \u20ac billion |    2.5 |    1.7 |    1.6 |\n| Resources                 | \u20ac billion |    5.7 |    3.7 |    3.2 |\n| Better life               | \u20ac billion |    4.8 |    3.2 |    3.1 |\n| Total Solutions net sales | \u20ac billion |    7.4 |    5.1 |    4.7 |\n\nThe total Solutions net sales figure is inferior to the sum of impact categories because products may have multiple impacts. For example, composite materials used in planes make the plane lighter, allowing lower greenhouse gas emissions (climate impact), but they also increase the plane's lifespan (resources impact).\n\n## EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\nSince 2009, with the exception of 2019 and 2020, Arthur D. Little (ADL), our partner in developing and improving our SPM methodology, has performed an in-depth verification of our market alignment results. In 2022, ADL screened every Product Application Combination in the database and 70 PACs were selected for deeper review, covering about 15% of the global turnover.\n\nDiscussions with Arthur D. Little revealed that we reach the same conclusion for 57 PACs out of the sample of 70, representing an agreement rate of 81%. For ten PACs (14%), Arthur D. Little came to a more negative conclusion than Solvay. From this, six PACs will be subjected to an in-depth investigation in 2023 before we implement the ADL conclusion in the SPM results. For three PACs (4%), Arthur D. Little reached a more positive conclusion than Solvay.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2.  EU taxonomy eligible activities\n\nThe EU taxonomy (2020/852) is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It is intended to play an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment and implement the European Green Deal. The EU taxonomy would provide companies, investors and policymakers with appropriate definitions under which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable. According to the new timeline set out in the taxonomy's Delegated Act 2021, companies published their first taxonomy eligibility report in 2022 and will have to publish their first taxonomy eligibility and alignment report in 2023.\n\nIn order to be taxonomy-eligible, an economic activity must contribute substantially to at least one of the six environmental objectives - climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water, circular economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity - and do no significant harm to the others. Currently, only climate mitigation and climate adaptation are considered. As such, the taxonomy only addresses a limited number of Solvay activities.\n\nIn order to be taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity needs first to be eligible as described above, and then fulfill the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 The economic activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of the climate and environmental objectives relevant to that activity.\n- \u00b7 The activity should do no significant harm to the other remaining objectives.\n- \u00b7 The activity should fulfill the minimum social safeguard standards based on OECD and UN guidelines.\n\nOur calculation of the share of 2022 Solvay sales eligible for and aligned with the EU taxonomy is based on our best interpretation of the EU taxonomy texts, including the 2021 version of Technical Annex of the Taxonomy Report.\n\nFigures reported for soda ash correspond to our Soda Ash and Derivatives business, which is a mono-technology business, as described on Solvay's website.\n\nFigures reported for plastics in primary form correspond to our Speciality Polymers business. Solvay's portfolio of specialty polymers is described on the Solvay website.\n\nEnabling economic activities, as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, do not substantially contribute to climate change mitigation on their own. Such activities play a crucial role in the decarbonization of the economy by directly enabling other activities to be carried out at a low carbon level of environmental performance.\n\nWe identified eligible enabling activities using our Sustainable Portfolio Management methodology, taking into account product and application combinations identified as 'climate solutions', as described above. This enables us to avoid double counting, as double counting is neutralized in the Sustainable Portfolio Management reporting of Solutions for each impact category, as described above. Possible double counting between transition activities and enabling activities are detailed in the table.\n\nSome of our activities, such as polymer membranes in batteries, or soda ash for glass in double glazing, may be eligible both as transitional and enabling activities. We have therefore removed these activities from the total of eligible activities.\n\nThe basis on which the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure were calculated is explained in the Financial Statements chapter of this report, note F1: revenue and segment information.\n\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures corresponding to enabling activities are not yet available. The eligible share of investments depends on the estimation of the corresponding eligible share of future sales. The allocation rules chosen mean that we estimate that 1% of turnover required 1% of capital expenditure and 1% of operational expenditure.\n\nWe also believe that the share of Group capital expenditure dedicated to Research and Innovation should be considered as eligible as it aims to improve our product portfolio to become more sustainable. This means that our total eligible capital expenditures is the sum of eligible capital expenditures from our transition activities and the estimation of capital expenditures from eligible enabling activities. Similarly the total eligible operating expenses is calculated as the sum of eligible operational expenditure from transition activities, the operational expenditures estimated for enabling activities and the amount dedicated to the operational expenditures spent on research and development.\n\nRegarding reporting on our aligned activities, our only manufacturing activities eligible as \"transition activities\" are soda ash and polymers, and these are not considered aligned for their turnover as they do not meet the technical criteria. The activities eligible as 'enabling activities' were also not considered for their turnover as we cannot demonstrate that they fulfill the 'do no significant harm' criteria for water, biodiversity, circular economy or pollution. However, Solvay has launched our STAR Factory Program, which aims to fully implement our Solvay One Planet at site level. STAR Factory will progressively be deployed in all our plants by 2030 and we believe that it will gradually deliver the required data to qualify our activities as aligned.\n\nAbout the calculation of the share of capital expenditures aligned with the EU taxonomy, we consider the capital expenditures spent on decreasing the environmental footprint of our soda ash production plus the amount spent by the Group on Research and Innovation.\n\nFollowing a similar reasoning, the calculation of operational expenditures aligned with the EU taxonomy mainly considers the share of operational expenditures spent on Research and Development.\n\nThe Group works hard to constantly improve our share of economical activities considered eligible for or aligned with the EU taxonomy. We believe that STAR Factory and other major programs will deliver on these objectives in the coming years.",

Definitions/uni00A0\n\nCircular Economy is a new approach to business that aims to decouple economic growth from consumption of natural resources. Solvay's Circular Economy Business Solution Program is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources. It is based on three principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Shifting our product portfolio to bio-based feedstocks, recycled-based feedstock and CO 2 -captured based feedstock.\n- \u00b7 Retaining the value of the products and materials currently in use by enabling product recycling (process additives and technology) or recyclability by design.\n- \u00b7 Designing products that increase the longevity of reusable materials.\n\nWe use the following definitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable resources: materials that are continually replenished at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of depletion. This includes plant-based materials from cultivation and animal-based materials from breeding. To fit in a circular economy, the material should be produced from food waste or using regenerative production practices.\n- \u00b7 Renewable energy: energy produced from renewable resources, namely solar, wind, hydroelectric power, biomass or geothermal. Energy provided by technological waste, such as solid recovered fuels, is not considered. Sales of energy to third parties are not included.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling increased durability: products designed to increase the longevity and durability of other products further down in the value chain in such a way that encourages longer use than the industry standard and at scale, without compromising circularity at the end of the product's functional life.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling recycling: products designed to increase the recycling yield, with regard to quality and quantity.\n\nThe measurement of products based on recycled or renewable materials and renewable energy is weighted by applying a factor of 85% to renewable materials and 15% to renewable energy, according to the average manufacturing cost weight. A similar approach has been defined at the research and innovation level to monitor the contribution of innovation projects to Solvay's circularity ambition.\n\n## 5.3.2. Management approach\n\nAs a company committed to the transition to a circular economy, we aim to more than double our circular revenues by 2030.\n\nWe define circular revenues as revenues generated with products and solutions that meet the following specific requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 made of bio-based, recycled-based and CO 2 captured carbon based raw materials, or produced with renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 designed to increase the lifespan of end-products, in such a way that encourages longer use than the industry standard in practice and at scale (e.g. marketing repair rather than replacement, timeless design with durable material choices) and in such a way that does not compromise circular treatment at the end of functional life;\n- \u00b7 innovative with regards to the recycling of materials in closed and open loops, and business models: designed to increase the recycling yield (quantity and quality) of the customers products.\n\nThe transformation of Solvay into a circular economy model is embedded in our business strategy. We are working individually and with customers, suppliers and partners to identify opportunities where the Group can leverage our capabilities.\n\nOur research and innovation project portfolio is screened and prioritized according to the principles of the circular economy and around 20% of our innovation budget was attributed to circular innovation in 2022.\n\nSolvay is the Chemical Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, contributing to accelerating the transition toward a circular economy. Chemistry, as a science and an industry, is a tremendously relevant and powerful enabler of material transformation and re-use.\n\n## Indicators\n\nWe monitor our progress in circular sales in accordance with the three principles of Solvay's circular business solutions, outlined above.\n\n|                                                                                                 | Units   |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Turnover of circular products                                                                   | %       |      9 | 5      | 5      |\n| Turnover of products based on recycled or biobased resources or  produced with renewable energy |         |      6 | 5      | 5      |\n| Turnover of products increasing longevity                                                       | %       |      3 | n.r.   | n.r.   |\n| Turnover of products enabling recycling                                                         | %       |      0 | n.r.   | n.r.   |\n\n- n.r.

This process is used as an opportunity to develop a circular economy mindset throughout the organization.\n\nA single point of contact is identified to consolidate the data and fill in the questionnaire for assessment. The scorecard and feedback provided by the Foundation are shared and discussed at an appropriate level inside the Group.\n\n## 5.3.3. Key achievements\n\nTo meet the unmet needs of our customers and to address the transition of our strategic markets in a circular economy, we accelerated our transformation .\n\nWe created a growth innovation platform focused on renewable materials and biotechnology to move away from fossil resources and develop sustainable, circular products.\n\nWe launched new high-performance surfactants in our Mirasoft\u00ae range for beauty care applications that are 100 % biobased and biodegradable. By developing a regenerative, sustainable chemistry, manufactured using a biotechnology process, we support the development of a bio-circular value chain in the personal care industry.\n\nWe achieved the ISCC+ certification, an internationally-recognized standard for bio-based and recycled-based materials, at our site in Zhangjiagang, China for our Fentamine\u00ae DMAPA UP, a bio-circular intermediate for surfactants.\n\nWe launched a new range of specialty polymers, the ReCycle MB polymers, made with recycled raw materials in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the product and meet our customers' recycled-content regulatory requirements. Udel\u00ae PSU ReCycle MB and Radel\u00ae PPSU ReCycle MB, used for hemodialysis membranes, will be produced from a recycled-based sulfone monomer in Augusta, Georgia, in the US, also certified ISCC+ in 2022.\n\n## 5.4.  Air quality\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 305-6 305-7 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 15\n\n## 5.4.1. Definitions\n\nNitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, conventionally expressed as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), comprise the emissions of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). NOx are reported due to their impact on acidification. NOx emissions from Solvay's operations result mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are excluded from this definition, as they have no impact on acidification. The impact of our N 2 O emissions is taken into account when assessing Solvay's contribution to climate change./uni00A0\n\nSulfur oxide (SOx) emissions, conventionally expressed as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), comprise the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3 ). SOx emissions arise mainly from the combustion of solid and liquid fuels (coal, anthracite or tar\u2026).\n\nAccording to the EU Solvent Directive 1999/13/EC, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are compounds with a standard boiling point below or equal to 250\u00b0C. Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) include all VOCs other than methane. The impact of main methane emissions from Solvay's mining activity at Green River, Wyoming, in the US, is therefore not included here, but is taken into account when calculating our contribution to climate change.\n\nOzone-depleting substances (ODS) are expressed as their summed CFC-11 equivalent, which is defined as the metric tonnes of ODSs weighted by their Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP).\n\n## 5.4.2. Management approach\n\nAir quality is managed through the health, safety and environment management systems deployed by our sites, in line with their regulatory requirements. Sites report at least on the substances they are allowed to emit according to their exploitation permit. Solvay works in close cooperation with local stakeholders to improve air quality at local and regional levels.",

Compared to 2021, the 2022 emissions dropped by 145mt (4%). This global reduction was achieved through a withdrawal from Russian coal and process improvements at our Torrelavega site in Spain.\n\nDue to some important historical corrections, the previously published value for non-methane volatile organic compounds in 2021 has been corrected in our database to 3,576mt.\n\nCompared to this value, NMVOC emissions increased slightly by 74mt (2%).\n\nDue to a few historical corrections, the previously published value for ozone-depleting substances in 2021 has been corrected in our database to 7.5 metric tons eq.

Definitions\n\nIndustrial waste is defined as the waste resulting from our regular manufacturing and research activities. It does not include domestic waste or waste from demolition or construction projects. Mining waste, which results from the prospecting and extraction of minerals, is reported separately from industrial waste. All our waste volumes are expressed as dry matter.\n\nFor EU sites, Hazardous Industrial Waste (HIW) is defined according to Appendix III of the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). For non-EU countries, classification follows local legislation.\n\nNon-sustainably treated waste comprises waste that is landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. It includes the waste with unknown final treatment at the time of the reporting.\n\n## 5.5.2. Management approach\n\nFor industrial waste, and hazardous industrial waste in particular, Solvay's focus is on switching to more sustainable disposal methods that avoid landfill or incineration without energy recovery and therefore promote material or thermal recovery.\n\nFor non-hazardous, mostly mineral, waste, Solvay is launching material recovery initiatives aligned with our ambition to contribute to the circular economy.",

Definitions\n\nWater management encompasses the management of water flows and water quality, from extraction from the natural environment to restitution in the same or another part of the environment.\n\nFreshwater withdrawal, measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is the amount of incoming freshwater purchased from third parties, such as drinking water from the public network, or pumped by Solvay from the public network (drinking water), from freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes, and from groundwater sources, such as aquifers. Freshwater consumption, also measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is calculated as the sum of water lost through evaporation, leakage, and exportation of products and waste. Water purchased or pumped for third parties are included in freshwater withdrawals. For/uni00A0example, water that is taken from a river for cooling and returned to it after use counts as freshwater withdrawal but not as freshwater consumption.\n\nAreas subject to hydric stress are identified using the database from Hoekstra et al. (2016), in conjunction with QGIS, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System.\n\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the amount of oxygen-reducing substances, mainly dissolved organic matter, discharged into aqueous receivers. COD is expressed as metric tons of oxygen. In addition to nitrogen and phosphorus species, COD also contributes to aquatic eutrophication.\n\nOur estimation of water consumption for Solvay's cradle-to-gate production - from resource extraction to the factory gate, before it is transported to the consumer - is effectively equivalent to the water consumption of a product. Simply put, it is the amount of water withdrawn, minus the amount of water of similar quality released back into the same watershed. This means that the water used in turbines for hydropower and the cooling of water in open-loop systems are not included in this indicator. Solvay's main areas of water consumption are in production, or what is known as industrial water, and in irrigation for bio-based raw materials.",

From the 330 million cubic meters for 2022, 30 (9%) is sold to third parties. The total freshwater withdrawal at Group level for 2022 is slightly lower than in 2021 (-1.7 million cubic meters or -0.5%) at constant scope and methodology.\n\nThe freshwater intake for our own operations decreased more significantly, from 306 million cubic meters in 2021 to 300 million cubic meters in 2022 (-2%). From this 300 million cubic meters, 36 million cubic meters (12%) is lost: 21 million cubic meters through evaporation from industrial cooling towers and 13 million cubic meters through exportation with aqueous end products, such as hydrogen peroxide. The remaining volume is lost with exported wastes or through leakages from underground piping networks.\n\nThe table below shows the number and percentage of sites located in areas subject to hydric stress and gives the freshwater withdrawal and freshwater consumption for these in 2022/uni00A0compared to the areas not subject to hydric stress.\n\n| 2022                                                     | Units                | Areas subject to  water stress   | Areas not subject  to water stress   | All areas   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Number of sites                                          | Number               | 23*                              | 90                                   | 113         |\n| Percentage of industrial sites under operational control | %                    | 20.0%                            | 80.0%                                | 100%        |\n| Freshwater withdrawal                                    | Million cubic meters | 18.5*                            | 311.5                                | 330         |\n| Freshwater consumption                                   | Million cubic meters | 6.6*                             | 29.4                                 | 36          |",

Definitions/uni00A0\n\nEmployee health and safety management encompasses occupational safety, industrial hygiene and occupational health./uni00A0\n\nOccupational safety is about preventing work-related injuries. Accidents are mostly linked to falls at the same level, human energy, such as pushing, pulling or striking an object, and exposure while opening a line or system. Industrial hygiene management encompasses the assessment, monitoring and management of workers' potential exposures to ergonomic, chemical and physical hazards. Occupational health includes all the preventive actions undertaken in order to protect and promote physical and psychological health at work, both collectively and for each individual Solvay employee.\n\nIn mid-2020, Solvay began using the OSHA definitions of occupational accidents in order to comply with GRI and enable comparisons outside Solvay. These are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Occupational accident: a work-related unexpected and undesirable event resulting in damage or harm, namely injury or illness. Accidents on the way to or from home are not considered as work-related unless the worker was traveling for Solvay at the time of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury or Illness (LTII): a work-related injury or illness that results in a work interruption of one or more days, not including the day of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury and Illness Rate (LTIIR): the number of LTIIs resulting from an accident per 200,000 work hours.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness (RII): work-related injury or illness resulting from an accident with severity above first aid, according to US OSHA 29 CFR 1904.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness rate (RIIR): the number of reportable injuries or illnesses per 200,000 work hours.\n\n## 6.1.2. Management approach/uni00A0\n\nSolvay requirements for implementing management systems on our sites are covered under section 3.3. Health, safety and environment management. The occupational health and safety management systems cover all Solvay employees, while external visitors, parcel delivery people and transport drivers not performing loading or unloading onsite fall outside the scope. In addition, our safety management system applies to contractors./uni00A0",

They cover the following topics or activities:\n\n- \u00b7 chemical hazard communication;\n- \u00b7 chemical risk assessment and management;\n- \u00b7 hearing conservation (noise exposure management);\n- \u00b7 prevention of legionellosis;\n- \u00b7 managing asbestos in buildings and facilities;\n- \u00b7 respiratory protection equipment;\n- \u00b7 group requirements for occupational health;\n- \u00b7 minimum safety requirements for lifting;\n- \u00b7 working at height;\n- \u00b7 working on powered systems;\n- \u00b7 line breaking;\n- \u00b7 working in confined spaces;\n- \u00b7 working in an explosive atmosphere;\n- \u00b7 lifting;\n- \u00b7 excavation;\n- \u00b7 traffic;\n- \u00b7 personal protective equipment (PPE);\n- \u00b7 work permits;\n- \u00b7 management of change (MOC);\n- \u00b7 contractor management.\n\nAll procedures contain training requirements, guidelines and on-boarding presentations for use in implementation on our sites. Quality, evaluations and process improvements are ensured through the sites' management systems. Site reporting processes identify unsafe situations, near-misses, incidents or accidents, as well as those cases with potentially high severity, and also set guidelines for investigating incidents and taking corrective actions./uni00A0\n\nIndustrial hygiene (IH) ensures hazards are identified and eliminated. Risk assessments are performed in collaboration with occupational health experts. Occupational physicians perform risk-based medical surveillance, provide advice on improving and adapting working conditions, and promote physical and mental health. All these processes contribute to managing and minimizing risks at work.\n\nOn the shop floor, workers collaborate with industrial hygienists on risk assessments using SOCRATES (Solvay Occupational Risk Assessment Tool for Employees). This tool gives widespread, easy access to IH methods, tools and databases, consistently performs and documents IH risk assessments and enhances traceability of an individual's potential exposures throughout their working life. Workers are informed of their work-related risks by supervisors, industrial hygienists and occupational physicians or nurses.\n\nFormal joint management-worker health and safety committees are established on our sites according to country legislation. Solvay also contributes to complementary health insurance, for which the terms vary according to the country./uni00A0\n\nInitiatives to promote health are taken at site level, in collaboration with local physicians and nurses. Examples of such initiatives include nutritional advice, cardiovascular prevention programs, general check-ups and fitness sessions led by trainers. During 2021, multilingual communication campaigns strongly promoted Covid-19 vaccination at Group level.\n\n## 6.1.3. Indicators\n\nImprovements in occupational health and safety indicators result from the safety culture approach implemented to protect everyone working at Solvay. This approach is explained in the Risk Management chapter of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nSolvay started recording reportable injuries and illnesses on July 1, 2020.\n\nThe reporting scope covers all sites under Solvay's operational control for which the Group manages and monitors safety performance. This includes our manufacturing, research and innovation and administrative sites, as well as a series of closed sites with limited activities, and covers Solvay employees and contractors working on these sites.",

This is the ratio of the total number of Chemical Risk Assessments, both inhalation and dermal, completed by the site within the last five years, to the total number of Chemical Risk Assessments to be conducted based on the Chemical Risk Assessment List established by the site.\n- \u00b7 The site regularly communicates identified potential occupational risks to the Medical Service provider.\n- \u00b7 At least 70% of the employees scheduled for Risk-Based Medical Surveillance during the year have completed their medical visit.\n\nIn 2022, 57.5% of our manufacturing and research and innovation sites fulfilled all the above criteria, while 49.2% of sites went a step further by fulfilling this criteria and achieving Chemical Risk Assessment completion rate of at least 50%.\n\n## Human biomonitoring of exposure\n\nHuman biomonitoring (HBM) of exposure involves measuring the concentration of a substance or its metabolites in human fluids, such as blood or urine. It can be used to assess exposure to specific chemicals and helps to verify whether protective measures are effective./uni00A0\n\nIn 2022, 19 sites performed HBM of exposure, for 36 different chemicals (substances or groups of substances).\n\n## HuMAN BIoMoNIToRING (HBM) oF eXPosuRe\n\n|                                                                       | Units   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sites performing HBM of exposure                                      | Number  |     19 |     19 |     25 |\n| Sites with at least one result above the Biological Limit Value (BLV) | Number  |      0 |      0 |      1 |\n\nFor sites that had results above the biological limit values, action plans were put in place to reduce the exposure levels.\n\n## Health promotion\n\nIn 2022, communication material on health promotion was deployed to all our sites. Topics included healthy nutrition, physical activity, sleep and recovery, alcohol abuse and tobacco cessation. At 89% of our sites, health and well-being topics were covered during our Health and Safety Days events. In addition, survey results show that 90% of our sites report active promotion and support for the health and well-being activities listed in the following table:\n\n| Health and well-being topics during the Health and Safety Days                            | 89%   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Permanent multidisciplinary committee that sets and follows actions on Well-being at Work | 57%   |\n| Training sessions on Well-being at Work for employees                                     | 62%   |\n| Training sessions on Well-being at Work for leaders                                       | 48%   |\n| Promotion of physical activity                                                            | 48%   |\n| Promotion of balanced nutrition                                                           | 42%   |\n| Promotion of good sleep and recovery                                                      | 31%   |\n| Prevention of cardiovascular risk                                                         | 34%   |\n| Prevention of tobacco consumption                                                         | 23%   |\n| Prevention of addictions                                                                  | 26%   |\n| Prevention and screening for cancer                                                       | 25%   |\n| Seasonal flu annual campaign                                                              | 64%   |\n\n## 6.1.4.

Definitions\n\nEmployee engagement is the level of commitment, passion and loyalty an employee has toward their work, team and company. Solvay believes that engagement increases performance through higher productivity and employee retention and that engagement is fostered by fair labor practices and well-being at work./uni00A0\n\nA constructive relationship with employees and their representatives, built on trust, is considered the basis of fair labor practices at Solvay. This relationship reflects the Group's commitment to respect employees' fundamental human rights and guarantee their social rights.\n\nWell-being at work is a holistic concept which relates to all aspects of the quality of working life that ensure workers are safe, physically and mentally healthy, satisfied, engaged and efficient. It addresses recognition and support, work-life balance, employee growth and development, and good communication and collaboration, based on International Labor Organization and World Health Organization definitions./uni00A0\n\n## 6.2.2. Management approach\n\n## ONE Pulse\n\nEmployee engagement is measured through confidential surveys open to all employees. This includes global surveys as well as local initiatives, such as 'Voice of the People'' surveys. The results of our surveys enable the Group, local management and all operational managers to identify strengths and areas where the working environment and employee experience can be improved./uni00A0\n\nIn 2022, we continued our series of short quarterly surveys, known as One Pulse surveys. Available in 14 languages, the One Pulse surveys enable us to listen to the feedback and opinions of Solvay employees around the world. This not only promotes a feedback culture, where everyone can safely share their opinions and have open conversations with their team and leaders, but also helps to improve employee experience at work. Our objective was to equip leaders at all levels in the organization with insights about the well-being and experience of their team, foster open dialogue and ensure continuous improvement throughout the year.\n\nWe also ran the second edition of our anonymous inclusion survey, which we combined for the first time with an extensive group-wide well-being diagnosis, based on HERO (HEalthy and Resilient Organizations). HERO is a scientifically-validated model from the positive organizational psychology approach developed by the University of Jaume I, Spain. It was well received, with a response rate of more than 64%.\n\n## Better Life at Work\n\nSince October 2016, a multidisciplinary Committee on Better Life at Work (BLAW) has been in place to define and promote a well-being at work (WBAW) program. It includes occupational physicians and psychologists, human resources experts, health, safety and environment experts, Global Business Unit representatives, and sustainable development experts, representing all regions./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, a new Better Life at Work program was launched, focused on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance: a multidisciplinary Better Life at Work Steering Committee, including representatives from our Human Resources (HR), Occupational Medicine, Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and Sustainable Development Functions, and an employee representative. Solvay's Chief People Officer serves as the Sponsor.\n- \u00b7 Observatory: the Better Life at Work Observatory includes indicators gathered from HR and HSE data, the Pulse surveys, and from diagnosis and assessment (see below). Managers can consult the indicators in the dashboard.\n- \u00b7 Positive actions: These are defined using the information gathered through the Observatory. In 2022, training sessions on well-being at work were provided to employees and managers (see below).\n\nFor diagnosis and assessment, we have carried out pilots at three Solvay sites, one each in Europe, the Americas and Asia, in collaboration with the University of Jaume I in Spain. In 2022, we completed our diagnosis of the three pilots and applied what we had learnt to the whole Group by carrying out a HERODEI survey, which includes wellbeing at work (HERO model) and DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion). This was conducted in November 2022, with a participation rate of 64.7% and will help us to assess which risk factors we need to address for well-being at work, as well as the positive factors that we can build on to create a sustainable Better Life at Work. A similar approach is being developed in the European H-Work Project, which aims to promote mental health in small and medium-sized enterprises and public workplaces, drawing on funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.\n\nManagers can easily consult the indicators, which include hard data such as absenteeism, accidentability, turnover and diversity, through the Better Life at work dashboard. Made available from the beginning of 2022, this new dashboard complements an existing dashboard that includes all Pulse and Survey results existing from March 2021. In 2022, 752 leaders accessed the Better Life dashboard and 102 subscribed to training sessions on how to use it.",

        "page_content": "In 2022, well-being at work training was provided to employees on resilience, and to managers on leading with a well-being mindset, in collaboration with Empreinte Humaine. Around 1,150 employees attended the live webinars or workshops on resilience, which were available in ten languages, and 83% found them useful or very useful. All employees now also have access to this content on our intranet. Between October 2022 and the end of March 2023, workshops on leading with a well-being mindset are provided to leaders in all countries in 13 languages. In 2022, 275 leaders were trained in 30/uni00A0sessions, covering topics such as healthy work, healthy leadership and providing healthy support to collaborators. More than 86% of leaders rated the workshop very useful. The remaining managers will be trained in 2023.\n\nRegarding labor relations, discussions and activities are held at four levels: site, country, european and Group.\n\n## Solvay Global Forum\n\nIn 2015, Solvay created a global employee representative body, the Solvay Global Forum, composed of nine employee representatives from the main areas where Solvay operates, namely Europe, the US, China, Brazil, India and South Korea. Video conferences are held quarterly, bringing together the Solvay Global Forum and the Group's top management to comment on and discuss the Group's quarterly results and to keep everyone informed of the main new projects. Two agreements have been signed with the Solvay Global Forum: Global Performance Sharing 2022 and Solvay Cares, the latter of which extended maternity and co-parent leave to 16 weeks./uni00A0In December 2021, the Group launched a Global employee shareholding initiative, that the Solvay Global forum wished to be an inclusive, simple and meaningful way to create sustainable shared value for all.\n\nThe Solvay Shares program is now open to employees around the world, irrespective of their position or grading. Employees get one free share and one additional free share for every two shares they own after a lock-in period. By mid-2023, 95% of our employees from 22 countries will be offered the possibility to buy shares, and get the same rights as every other shareholder. This program should increase employees' understanding of the Group's performance, as well as their sense of belonging.\n\n## European Works Council\n\nWe have been in permanent dialogue with our European Works Council (EWC) for more than 20 years. In 2022, the EWC met physically on three occasions and the EWC Secretariat met eleven times, either virtually or physically, with senior Group management, to help steer Solvay's evolution. The main topics discussed were reorganizations, actions taken by the Group to face the consequences of the Ukraine war, the support given to employees to cope with high inflation, the evolution of working conditions with the extension of mobile working, the Group Sustainable Development strategy and Solvay's financial results.\n\n## Solvay Cares\n\nIn February 2017 Solvay signed a global agreement guaranteeing a minimum level of welfare and healthcare protection for all Solvay Group employees worldwide. Solvay Cares was fully deployed in 2019 and aims to provide four major benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 full income protection during parental leave, with 16 weeks for both parents;\n- \u00b7 a minimum coverage of 75% of medical fees in the event of hospitalization or severe illness;\n- \u00b7 disability insurance in the event of lasting incapacity;\n- \u00b7 life insurance, including coverage for the family or partner.\n\nAn addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2021, introducing more flexibility for parents to enjoy parental leave according to family needs, and adding the Employee Wellbeing Support program, through which we committed to giving all employees access to confidential mental health support as from December 2021. From January 2023, globally-aligned standards of the Employee Wellbeing Support Program will apply, ensuring coverage not only for the employee, but also for all members of the employee's household.\n\n## The IndustriALL Global Union Framework Agreement\n\nOn December 17, 2013, Solvay signed a Corporate Social and Environmental Agreement for the whole Group with IndustriALL Global Union. This agreement is based on International Labor Organization standards and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. It is a tangible expression of Solvay's determination to ensure that basic labor rights and the Group's social standards in the areas of health, safety and environmental protection are respected at all of our sites.\n\nIn March 2022, we renewed our Global Framework Agreement with IndustriALL. We strengthened the content of the agreement in several important areas, including teleworking rights, EU due diligence and UN binding treaty relating to the supply chain, just transition, skills transfer, and workers' rights to health and safety.\n\nWith this renewed and strengthened agreement, Solvay commits to respecting the international social standards defined by the International Labor Organization and the principles of the UN Global Compact, including in countries that have not ratified it, as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nThe four-year agreement includes serious commitments on due diligence along the supply chain. The agreement establishes a new working group of workers and management to investigate suppliers' respect for core labor rights and seek remediation where problems are found. Solvay commits to suspend contracts with suppliers that fail to remedy human rights and environmental abuses following warnings.\n\nIn 2022, IndustriALL representatives, together with Solvay management, visited three of our US subsidiaries in order to assess labor relations. It was an opportunity to confirm the positive working atmosphere, safety situation and industrial relations, and to identify areas for improvement.",

Indicators/uni00A0\n\nWith regard to engagement and well-being at work, three recurring surveys and one special edition on diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) and well-being were launched worldwide between March and November 2022, collecting an average of 13,000 responses or a response rate of around 60%.\n\nEach survey is made up of between ten to 12 questions measuring well-being, safety and other dimensions related to employee experience, such as relationships with managers, remote working, Solvay behaviors and workload./uni00A0\n\nIn the four surveys, employees were asked how they were feeling. The percentage of respondents feeling 'OK or better' was over 70% on average, remaining relatively stable as compared to last year. In addition to our Employee Assistance Program, Solvay has put together a guide for managers to help them better support their teams and a flyer for all employees, available in multiple languages. These provide guidance and suggestions about where to turn for help and encouragement, in order to better support those employees who have reported feeling 'less than OK'./uni00A0\n\n## DURING THE LAST FOUR WEEKS, IN GENERAL, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING?\n\n|              | Units   |   Sep. 2021 |   Mar. 2022 |   Apr. 2022 |   Sep. 2022 |\n|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| OK or better | %       |          76 |          73 |          72 |          79 |\n| Less than OK | %       |          24 |          27 |          28 |          21 |\n\nWe also include three engagement questions in our One Pulse survey annually. This revealed that about 75% of employees were satisfied and proud to be working at Solvay and that about 70% would recommend the company as a great place to work.\n\n## Employee Representation Indicator\n\nAll Solvay employees are covered by a collective agreement. This is the Solvay Cares collective agreement with global employee representative body the Solvay Global Forum.\n\nTrade unions are present at a majority of Solvay sites around the world. Union membership is estimated at 20% in Europe, 25% in South America, 30% in North America and 70% in Asia.\n\n## 6.2.4. Key achievements/uni00A0\n\n## First Employee Share Purchase Plan launched with high level of subscription\n\nFor the first time in Solvay's history, the Group offered to employees the opportunity to become a Solvay shareholder by purchasing Solvay shares on preferential terms.\n\nThe Employee Share Purchase Plan is part of Solvay's employee engagement process. It recorded an exceptional participation rate of close to 28%, well above the best in class of 25%, clearly demonstrating the high level of engagement among Solvay employees and their commitment to our future. In total, 6,105 employees participated, ranging from operators to managers, with an average monthly investment of 180\u20ac. Like any other shareholder, Solvay's employees will now have the opportunity to better appreciate the Group's performance, and experience the risks and rewards of share ownership.\n\nOur response to the Covid-19 crisis showed that people could work collaboratively from outside the office. As a result, we successfully launched a global mobile working policy, which has been deployed across 35 of our administrative sites in 19 countries. More than 7,500 employees are now working in a hybrid mode with both remote and onsite work.\n\nDuring this period we continued to develop the framework used for meeting with our representatives in a hybrid mode. This involved face-to-face meetings where possible, but also making use of the flexibility offered by remote communication, especially in cases where a topic justified a shorter discussion or needed to be held at shorter notice.\n\n## 6.3.  Diversity and inclusion\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 405-1 405-2 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 8\n\n## 6.3.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay defines diversity, equity and inclusion in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity: the representation of various identities and differences of individuals in a group.\n- \u00b7 Equity: creating equal access to opportunity by recognizing the existence of advantages for some and barriers for others; promoting justice, impartiality and fairness within procedures, processes and distribution of resources by institutions and systems.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion: actively and intentionally engaging people with different identities and enabling them to feel valued, able to fully contribute and be welcomed within a given setting.",

Once per year the survey is dedicated to measuring the feeling of inclusion and well-being. We also introduced questions allowing employees to self-identify, so that we could measure if there were any inclusion experience gaps. Based on the 2022 survey, which was answered by 64.6% of Solvay's workforce:\n\n- \u00b7 4% of respondents self identified as having a disability (visible or invisible, such as mental health challenges);\n- \u00b7 2% of respondents self identified as LGBTQ+;\n- \u00b7 8% of respondents self identified as a member of an ethnically under-represented group in the country that they live in.\n\n## RATIo oF BAsIc sAlARY oF WoMeN To MeN BY MANAGeMeNT cATeGoRY\n\nThe table below represents the ratio of unadjusted (without correction for seniority) average pay between male and female employees where the average pay of male employees is 1.00:\n\n| Country   |   Junior management |   Middle management | Senior management   |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Belgium   |                0.96 |                0.95 | 1.05                |\n| Brazil    |                0.9  |                0.94 | ND**                |\n| China     |                0.94 |                1.08 | ND**                |\n| France    |                0.95 |                0.95 | 0.97                |\n| Italy     |                0.95 |                0.9  | 0.87                |\n| US        |                0.94 |                0.98 | 0.97                |\n\n- **ND: not disclosed: too few data points in one or two measurement groups to make a statistically meaningful measurement.",

        "page_content": "We created a statistically-sound model for computing an 'expected salary' by country and job class, against which we measured pay gaps. On that basis a pay gap review was conducted for 951 employees that were identified as priority for manual analysis. When the pay gap could not be objectively justified by performance, seniority or another objective reason, it led to an off-cycle salary increase, performed in January 2023. This exercise was conducted in a gender neutral manner.\n\n## 6.3.4. Key achievements\n\nWe set ourselves five priorities in 2022, which all showed very concrete results.\n\n## Root DEI in our organization\n\nOur focus was on increasing the sense of accountability in the organization. We achieved this through the creation of an 'homogeneity index', a new quarterly measure of the diversity of Solvay entities based on three dimensions: gender, age and nationality. In addition, we included the DEI roadmap in the Solvay One Planet part of the Short Term Incentive.\n\nOur DEI and non-discriminatory policy was also updated and published.\n\n## Empower Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to become change agents\n\nThere were a lot of activities in this area in 2022, with the launch of the European chapter of X Factor, our ERG empowering women, the launch of ADAPT, a brand new ERG for employees with disability, their caregivers and all their allies, and the creation of the Voice of Asia ERG, aimed at establishing mutual understanding between Asian and Western cultures.\n\nAll of the ERGs also came together during our first virtual ERG Convention, with 300 participants.\n\nThe critical role of the ERGs was recognized when our Senior Leadership Team signed a pledge in September 2022, committing, among other things, to take part in two ERG-organized events per year.\n\n## Offer impactful mentoring and training opportunities\n\nStarted in 2021, we continued our significant commitment to send 450 women through 'the A Effect', an external development program designed for women. With 300 women participating in 2022, 22% of the targeted population - junior female managers - have now completed the program. We are now designing our first survey to measure the impact 18 months after the first cohort started.\n\nExternal programs are not enough, so we complemented them with a structured mentoring offer, recruiting high level mentors that could serve as sponsors. Our focus is on mentees from under-represented groups, starting with women. In 2022, 128 mentees benefited from the formal program, on top of more informal mentoring already happening at Solvay.\n\nFinally a custom, four-hour long, inclusive leadership workshop was designed for our leaders, and 38 internal facilitators were certified to provide it. In 2022, 200 people received this training, and the goal is to reach 500 people by June 2023.\n\n## Bring DEI to the shop floor\n\nDEI was the topic of our fourth annual Citizen Day event, providing the perfect opportunity to bring the conversation on DEI to a maximum number of employees on the shop floor. It was a tremendous success, with close to 8,900 individuals from 103 sites participating in 320 global or site activities, amounting to a total of 14,700 participations, compared to 13,300 for last year's edition. Employee participation was converted into a \u20ac50,000 donation, which will be distributed among local charities in the 14 countries with the highest participation.\n\n## Reinventing progress\n\nTrue to our heritage we aim to raise the bar when it comes to the positive social impact of our company. This year, our work on equitable pay has been particularly innovative, including voluntary disclosure of our gender pay gaps in our main country of non-hourly population, reporting of pay scales in the US on a national level and not only in the states that mandate it; and an internal pay equity exercise, complementing the external exercises already done based on comparatio.\n\nOur CEO, Ilham Kadri, has been elected chair of the Business Commission Tackling Inequality group within the WBCSD and the Business 4 Inclusive Growth in order to combine the efforts of both groups and maximize their impact.",

Definitions\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the indicator used to measure customer loyalty for each of Solvay's Global Business Units. The metric was developed by, and is a registered trademark of, Fred Reichfeld, Bain & Company and Satmetrix. GBU scores are consolidated at the Group level through a revenuebased weighted average.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score is calculated based on customer responses to a single question: 'How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague?' Answers can range from 0 to 10. Those who respond 9 or 10 are called Promoters and considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, making positive referrals to other potential customers. Those who respond with a score from 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors and are not supportive. Those who give a response of 7 or 8 are labeled Passives. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.\n\nSolvay uses the Net Promoter System SM methodology to boost customer loyalty by promoting a culture of customer feedback and by developing active listening skills at every single touchpoint in the customer journey. The objective is to go far beyond 'just a score', toward a deep transformation of the Group by fostering a more customer-centric culture.\n\nThe Net Promoter System SM is structured around two pillars, allowing us to gather insights at both the strategic and operational levels. The objective of the first and more strategic stage is to identify and further reinforce the areas where the Group truly stands out against the competition in order to raise customer loyalty and accelerate growth. The second, more operational, stage captures how customers perceive our offer from a day-to-day perspective. These key insights trigger tangible action plans - both account-specific and at the GBU level - to bring Solvay closer to our customers and better serve them by delivering more suitable and efficient services.\n\n## 6.5.2. Management approach\n\nSince 2014, each GBU has conducted a customer satisfaction survey at least once every two years to check their strategic alignment with the trends in their business environment. The aim is to identify and select the right areas for each GBU to focus on, as well as to foster differentiation and accelerate growth.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score has been selected as the key indicator of customer loyalty for the Group. It is measured at the Global Business Unit level, consolidated at the Group level and published annually.\n\nIn 2018, Solvay decided to take this approach to the next level by launching the Net Promoter SystemSM, aimed at transforming the work practices of the entire frontline population across all GBUs and geographies. This ensures that a customer feedback culture is embedded in our DNA.\n\nThe insights gathered from our customers trigger action plans, allowing us to continuously adapt our value proposition to better serve our customers and increase our share of wallet.\n\n## 6.5.3. Indicators\n\nIn 2022, Solvay focused on getting feedback from our key customers, ensuring their customer experience could be improved at all levels of the organization.\n\nAdditionally, 2,300 surveys were sent to Materials customers. For Speciality Polymers, the score was stable compared to 2019, while Composite Materials recorded a decrease, mainly due to disruptions in the commercial aviation supply chain as a result of the rebound following the Covid crisis.\n\nThe Materials GBU is conducting a root cause analysis and defining an action plan in order to address customers' key areas of concern and reinforce key recommendations.\n\n|                                   | Units   |   2022 |   2021 | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Solvay's Net Promoter Score (NPS) | %       |     26 |     32 | NA     |\n\n## ECOVADIS ASSESSMENT\n\nAbout 150 customers, representing more than 25% of Solvay's sales, use EcoVadis to assess Solvay's performance as a supplier. The EcoVadis sustainability assessment methodology is an evaluation of how well a company has integrated the principles of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into their business and management system.\n\nSolvay is in the top 2% of companies rated by EcoVadis in the manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms industry.",

Corporate citizenship\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 413-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 17\n\nSolvay's Corporate Citizenship program is our guide to making a positive impact on society at large, and our stakeholders: partners; employees; investors; local communities; customers; and others. The contributions we make are derived from our technologies, solutions, and innovations, as well as our spirit of service and giving. Disclosure of Solvay's indirect economic impact is provided in this section.\n\n## 6.6.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay remains deeply committed to philanthropic endeavors through our contributions to worldwide societal challenges, supporting projects in three distinct areas: Protecting the Planet; Nurturing Innovation; and Fostering Education. Our initiatives in each of these three categories are closely aligned with our business, including our active involvement in several flagship endeavors that truly reflect the way we partner with our stakeholders.\n\n## 6.6.2. Management approach\n\nThe Corporate Citizenship Steering Committee is composed of five members and chaired by Solvay's Chief Executive Officer. The Committee gathers three times a year, approves budgets and decides on projects costing \u20ac50,000 or more.\n\nBusiness Programs for Social Needs are programs that generate business value through addressing social needs. These programs fall under the governance of the relevant GBU. Examples include the Sustainable Guar Initiative, managed by Novecare, and the Sustainable Vanilla Initiative, managed by Aroma.\n\nSite directors are accountable for developing and implementing each site's societal actions plan. This involves assembling a dedicated working group including the site director, HR manager, communication manager,local sustainability correspondent and employee representatives. Employee initiatives are encouraged and supported. An example of this is our Citizen Day actions: the concept is proposed by the Corporate Citizenship committee, but implemented by the individual sites.\n\n## 6.6.3. Indicators\n\n## Citizen Day 2022\n\nCitizen Day gives Solvay employees around the world the opportunity to engage in actions with local communities. The event was created by our CEO, Ilham Kadri, in 2019 to reinforce our purpose - we bond people, ideas, and elements to reinvent progress - and encourage employees to act as one team for one planet.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) was the theme of our Citizen Day in 2022. The event provided a unique opportunity for Solvay employees to reconnect, raise awareness on this topic and take actions to create more inclusive workplaces and communities.\n\nKey figures from Citizen Day 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7 14,700 participations;\n- \u00b7 320 activities;\n- \u00b7 105 participating sites;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac50,000 raised and donated to DEI-related NGOs.\n\nCitizen Day activities took place at global, site, team and individual levels, and in both virtual and in-person formats, with many involving partners and NGOs. We also encouraged employees to get involved with the local community and speak up against non-inclusive behaviors.",

The project aims to ensure that Solvay becomes a paperless, single-use plastic free and zero food waste company by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, 34% of printers were eliminated from offices allowing \u20ac462,000 in cost savings. Fifteen sites are now single-use plastic free and 23 sites are recycling biodegradable waste.\n\n## GirLS are leading the way!\n\nGirls Leading in Science (GirLS) is the name of a special competition initiated by women scientists from Solvay Research and Innovation in Belgium. It aims to inspire young people, and more specifically girls, to pursue higher education in a scientific or technological field.\n\nConducted in two stages, the competition consists of a pre-selection phase and a final. During pre-selection, 35 students were chosen based on their short video submissions, in which they discussed the scientific or technical subject of their choice. Projects were submitted by a total of 12 applications (in-group), representing the three regions of Belgium.\n\nFor the final, the 2022 contestants had to demonstrate their creativity and scientific skills while, in groups, brainstorming on a fascinating theme: 'What if the earth let go of its spin around the sun?\". The winning team received the prize of having their first-year tuition paid for scientific or technical studies at university.",

Major projects\n\n## Solvay Solidarity Fund support\n\nIn 2022, Solvay continued to support employees and local communities in need through the Solvay Solidarity Fund (SSF), assisting more than 50 projects in 14 different countries. Originally set up to help employees cope with hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fund now also addresses other kinds of hardship. Our major focus in 2022 was on supporting those affected by the war in Ukraine. We donated around \u20ac1.5 million to a number of initiatives organized at global and site levels:\n\n- \u00b7 The SSF supported the Ukraine crisis operation led by the Belgian Red Cross with \u20ac1 million, making it possible to strengthen Red Cross international operations on Ukrainian soil and logistical support activities in Belgium to benefit people fleeing Ukraine.\n- \u00b7 BEforUkraine, a Belgian nonprofit, brings humanitarian, material and logistics aid to Ukrainians, both in Ukraine and in Belgium. Money from the Fund and employee donations paid for two ambulances with specialized medical equipment.\n- \u00b7 In Hospital No. 6 in Kiev, money from the Fund supported the launch of a training program for medical teams dealing with the treatment of war rapes.\n- \u00b7 Solvay sites around the globe were encouraged to translate corporate actions into local initiatives using money made available through the SSF. Sites worked with their local communities to provide much-needed aid and assistance for relief efforts or to provide more direct support for Ukrainian refugees in the local area. Some examples include:\n- -In Rheinberg, Germany, Solvay employees converted apartments located at the site into housing for refugees.\n- -In Poland, employees worked with the local city hall to identify and collect the items most needed by refugees in the area.\n- -Employees in Lyon, France, joined the effort, collecting vital aid that was transported to our site in Poland.\n\nSolvay was named as one of the winners of the 2022 CEFIC European Responsible Care Awards in the category of Humanitarian Aid, in recognition of all our efforts to help those most affected by the conflict.\n\n## The Science For the Future Solvay Prize\n\nThe Science for the Future Solvay Prize recognizes major scientific discoveries with the potential to shape chemistry in the future and advance human progress. Created in 2013, this prize perpetuates Ernest Solvay's lifelong support of, and passion for, scientific research. Our objective is to endorse key research and highlight the essential role of chemistry, both as a science and an industry, in helping to solve some of the world's most pressing issues./uni00A0\n\nThe 2022 Science for the Future Solvay Prize was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3, Adjunct Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, in the US, and Professor at the University of Szeged, in Hungary, for her work on the biochemical modification of synthetically produced messenger RNA (mRNA), which has enabled the rapid development of vaccines. Her research was most notably used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to build Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, which have saved many lives. It could also help fight other diseases like cancer, or infection from influenza, malaria or HIV in the future. Professor Karik\u00f3 has dedicated her 40-year career to using RNA as a therapeutic, with chemistry as a key element to modify the mRNA to avoid the risk of rejection by the immune system.\n\n## CommonLit: making literacy education in the US accessible for everyone\n\nCommonLit is an American nonprofit EdTech organization dedicated to ensuring that all students, regardless of background and socioeconomic status, graduate with the reading, writing, communication and problem-solving skills they need to be successful in university and later life. To accomplish this goal, CommonLit has developed an innovative digital literacy program that helps teachers advance their students' literacy through a high-quality digital curriculum, analytic dashboards that track student growth and personalized support for students.\n\nSolvay supports CommonLit's work with financial commitments made through the Epic Foundation, a global organization connecting nonprofits creating solutions to today's pressing challenges with individuals and businesses who want to drive positive change. This important three-year investment will support schools in 55 zip codes in the US, going hand-in-hand with our broader commitment to invest in local communities and support science careers.\n\n## CERN: fostering interest in STEM and STEM careers\n\nThe CERN-Solvay Education Program was launched in January 2022. Designed to foster interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and STEM careers, the program combines both online and onsite learning at CERN, starting with education content aimed at a global online audience and progressing to an opportunity for students to engage more deeply with research at CERN.\n\nThe program is part of the education portfolio of Science Gateway, CERN's new flagship project for science education and outreach. The program has three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Online social media education content.\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Online courses for high school students.\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Onsite international Solvay camp.\n\n## SPARKOH!: promoting jobs in STEM fields for high school students\n\nAs part of our efforts to encourage younger generations to get involved in STEM subjects, Solvay is supporting SPARKOH!, a science adventure park near Mons in Belgium, with the mission to arouse curiosity and get people asking questions about scientific and technological topics relevant to society.\n\nThe main focus of Solvay's support is the museum's You Tomorrow: the jobs of the future exhibition. Aimed primarily at high school students, this exhibition profiles hundreds of jobs in the STEM field and allows visitors to discover the skills needed for these professions in an interactive and engaging space.",

The school's Green Energy Team is an extracurricular immersive experience, in which students use advanced materials and batteries to create a highperforming solar car to compete in a national-level high school race: the Solar Car Challenge. For the students involved, the Challenge is a unique opportunity to gain experience in many different areas, including technical, electrical, mechanical and computer skills, and knowledge of business and communication.\n\nAccompanying the RAHS Green Energy Team as they collaborate on this renewable energy engineering project is fully aligned with our Purpose. The team finished first in their category for the third year in a row and with new records to show for it.\n\n## Ellen MacArthur Foundation\n\nIn January 2018, Solvay and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation signed a three-year Global Partner agreement that gives the Group an opportunity to make a difference in accelerating the transition to a circular economy in the chemicals sector.\n\n## Sustainable Guar Initiative\n\nSolvay is the world's leading producer of guar derivatives. Guar is a drought-resistant legume grown in semi-arid areas, predominantly in India. Rajasthan accounts for approximately 70% of the country's production.\n\nSince 2015, Solvay has been spearheading a large-scale development initiative to make guar cultivation more sustainable, while boosting the incomes of the farmers who produce it. In collaboration with L'Oreal and Henkel, two of our strategic customers active in personal care, and with the support of the NGO TechnoServe, the Sustainable Guar Initiative (SGI) has trained more than 7,000 farmers in Bikaner over four years, and developed more than 971 kitchen gardens in 36 villages.\n\nThe initiative's primary objective is to encourage sustainable and climate-smart agriculture, increasing farmers' revenues through good guar cultivation practices for seed selection, seed treatment, sowing and pest management. The initiative also empowers women through specific training on hygiene, health and nutrition, which enables us to:\n\n- \u00b7 encourage better nutritional practices by growing vegetables in kitchen gardens in a region where the traditional diet is very limited;\n- \u00b7 improve health and hygiene practices for the women and their children.\n\nThe initiative also focuses on agroforestry, with more than 66,000 trees planted to fight sand movement and soil erosion in the fields. In addition to this, trees are planted in communities and technical advice is provided, making 12 different types of fruit available to these communities.\n\nAs water is a rare resource in Rajasthan, a village pond with a capacity of 15.89 million liters was created, helping 150 households gain increased access to drinking water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems were also installed, collecting 8,000 liters of water used for the kitchen gardens.\n\nWe have also taken additional steps to advance this initiative by embedding blockchain in the SGI program. The roll-out has started and is already showing progress. With over 2,000 farmers now registered, blockchain is helping to strengthen the value chain by providing transactional transparency and provenance tracking:\n\n- 1.  Transactional transparency: validating each payment made to the farmer with transactional records such as quantity, cost, date, payout, date of payment and receipt of payment. The farmer - who is in fact the building block of the SGI - is now officially enfranchised into the supply chain.\n\nFIGURES [October 2021 to January 2023]\n\nTotal transactions = 1,322\n\nTotal volume of guar seed purchased = 17,600 Qunitals\n\nTotal amount paid to farmers = 103,297,123 INR ($1,291,214)\n\n- 2.  Provenance: the blockchain immutability and provenance engine enables us to prove the 'origin' of guar seed for every purchase made. It also enables us to maintain tamper-resistant traceability of guar seed right back to each farmer. The guaranteed inclusion of farmers in the process grants them the ability to negotiate, proof of sale, proof of payment and bankability.\n\nFarmers lack a recorded account of their finances, which is a barrier to gaining fiscal credibility. A complete history of the transactions conducted with a global supply chain on blockchain will significantly improve farmers credit scores over time. It represents a vital first step to achieving a banking identity, with easy access to microfinance and access to a favorable credit line with Agro-Input companies.",

Definitions\n\nProduct stewardship means managing risks throughout a product's entire life cycle, from the design stage to end of life. Risks include the possibility of injury or impact on health for a third party or damage to third party property arising from the misuse of Solvay products in a customer's plant or use in an application for which the product is not designed. Risk management is particularly important for products used in healthcare, food and feed applications.\n\n## 6.7.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's Responsible Care policy requires the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain a comprehensive understanding of each product's hazards, risks and impacts related to all life-cycle steps and intended applications.\n- \u00b7 Manage product knowledge so as to comply with local requirements on product information, while ensuring worldwide consistency.\n- \u00b7 Keep records of all necessary and required product safety information to ensure availability throughout the full life cycle, beyond the commercialization period.\n- \u00b7 Send standardized product safety data sheets to customers along with the first delivery and when required by local regulations. This key information is consistently maintained and distributed worldwide for all products to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local languages.\n\nIn line with our Responsible Care commitment, we are constantly improving our knowledge of how Solvay products are used and the associated risks. The extensive knowledge this represents allows Solvay to characterize and manage risks related to product handling and to prioritize mitigation actions related to potential inappropriate use. The management of Safety Data Sheets reflects this commitment to ensuring the information on hazards associated with our products is readily available to our employees and customers.\n\nSolvay ensures that our product portfolio complies with all the relevant regional and national chemical regulations such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances) in the European Union, UK REACH in the United Kingdom, K-REACH in South Korea, KKDIK in Turkey and TSCA in the USA.\n\nIn addition, Solvay has a strategy to decrease the use of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in marketed products and more broadly throughout the entire value chain. We focus on the SVHC on the EU REACH authorization list (annex XIV) and EU REACH candidate list, but we also go beyond this, following an internal process in our operations worldwide. Specifically, we have set up our own reference list of SVHCs, the Solvay-SVHC and Substance Requiring Attention (SRA). This was established in 2015 and includes three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Black list Solvay-SVHCs: already undergoing a regulatory phase out process with a known deadline in at least one country or zone, or a restriction for uses relevant to Solvay.\n- \u00b7 Red list Solvay-SVHCs: currently included in regulatory lists of substances that could enter into a process of special authorization or restriction in the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Yellow list S-SRAs: substances requiring specific attention, such as substances under scrutiny by authorities, NGOs, scientists and industries due to their known hazardous properties or potential effects.\n\nRisk studies and Analysis of Safer Alternatives (ASA) for red and black Solvay-SVHCs placed on the market are underway, and substances are replaced with safer alternatives where feasible.\n\nNew ASA covering newly-identified listed SVHC are being performed within three years./uni00A0All current Analysis of Safer Alternatives are being reviewed every three years.\n\n## 6.7.3. Indicators\n\n## SAFETY DATA SHEETS\n\nSolvay currently places over 15,800 products on the market and produces safety data sheets (SDS) in 39 languages, as well as specific SDS for 63 countries. Product Stewardship programs give adequate information and technical assistance to customers, ensuring a good understanding of products and how to safely use and handle them. Each of our Global Business Units are responsible for ensuring that SDS are revised at least once every three years, or every time a substance undergoes significant modifications. Solvay manages product information centrally and as legislation continues to evolve the Group learns more about the conditions under which products are used, so as to record and assess any associated risks.\n\nTo make sure that customers are receiving new and updated Safety Data Sheets, and to limit the quantity of paper printed, Solvay uses an automatic system to send SDS by email. In 2022, this automated shipping function was activated for 99.8% of Solvay sales. This automatic delivery of the SDS was successful for 90.5% of shipments, where SDS were available for the delivery country and the customer's email address was also available. When errors occurred, SDS were emailed manually./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "## PRODUCT REGISTRATION\n\nREACH is an advanced European framework regulation requiring companies to have detailed knowledge of substances, their hazards and risks during use. This knowledge must be collected and organized into reliable and systematic safety information that includes all uses and risks incurred along the value chain. Solvay fully complies with the extensive REACH requirements for product registrations. We have registered 812 dossiers and are the lead or sole registrant for 292 substances. In accordance with the Cefic Action Plan program, we are also dedicated to improving the quality of REACH dossiers.\n\nRegular updates of dossiers are performed according to REACH obligations, either as new information becomes available or at the request of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA). In total, we have carried out 751 REACH updates on dossiers, with 91 in 2018, 152 in 2019, 142 in 2020, 236 in 2021 and 130 in 2022.\n\nIn addition, Solvay continues to adapt to new product regulations in many countries, notably to cope with emerging, REACH-like regulations in nonEuropean countries. More specifically we have:\n\n- \u00b7 registered 13 dossiers in 2019 and 23 in 2021 in the framework of Korean REACH and identified 22 potential lead dossiers for the next registration deadline in 2024;\n- \u00b7 reported 381 substances or polymers to be registered in the framework of KKDIK Reach Turkey by December 31, 2022 and registered 11 lead dossiers;\n- \u00b7 reported 5,222 substances in the framework of 'existing chemicals' in the Eurasian inventory in 2020-2022;\n- \u00b7 reported 275 substances in the framework of the National Chemical Inventory (NCI) of Vietnam;\n- \u00b7 submitted 10 substances in the framework of the new Chinese MEE order N\u00b012 in 2022;\n- \u00b7 for UK REACH, Solvay successfully completed 136 grandfathering registrations, four new registrations and 2,003 Downstream User Import Notifications ('DUIN') within the relevant regulatory deadlines.\n\n## SAFER ALTERNATIVES FOR MARKETED PRODUCTS: BEYOND LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n\nSolvay is closely monitoring the SVHC on the EU REACH Candidate list and EU REACH Authorization list (annex XIV) by identifying all marketed products containing a concentration above 0.1% of those substances, sold not only in the EU but worldwide\n\nWe go beyond what is required by regulation, screening our own broader internal reference list of substances of very high concern (Solvay-SVHCs, as described above) for our products marketed worldwide.\n\n|                                                                                   | Units   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| All Solvay-SVHCs (1) present in marketed products above 0.1% on a worldwide scope | Number  |    121 |    133 |     97 |\n| Analysis of safer alternatives required  (2)                                      | Number  |    142 |    152 |    130 |\n| Of which completed                                                                | %       |     63 |     45 |     51 |\n| Of which effective replacement achieved                                           | %       |     36 |     30 |     31 |\n\n- (1) According to the black and red Solvay-SVHC lists. SVHCs manufactured by, or forming part of, the composition of products sold by Solvay worldwide.\n- (2) Analysis of Safer Alternatives for potential substitution for an SVHC. A substance may be present in more than one product.\n\nAnalysis of safer alternatives is required and planned for a total of 142 combinations of products and applications. Of the 89 analyses of safer alternatives completed as of December 31, 2022, since the start of the program:\n\n- \u00b7 32 have led to effective replacement, either through SVHC substitution or reduction below required threshold, or through stopping production.\n- \u00b7 28 are ongoing, meaning that an alternative has been identified and discussed with customers for implementation. For example:\n- -strontium chromate and barium chromate: non-chromated alternative products proposed to customers and progressive switch ongoing for some identified applications;\n- -sulfolane: reduction below required threshold for some grades.\n- \u00b7 29 have resulted in no available alternatives, either because no substitute is available, there are regulatory obligations to use SVHC for some applications, or because an alternative has not been requested due to the application in the final product. For example:\n- -4.4-Methylenedianiline: for some uses there is no possible substitution as these products are qualified for specific aerospace uses.\n\n## SOLVAY'S COMMITMENT TO PHASE OUT SUBSTANCES OF VERY HIGH CONCERN\n\nSolvay has a target to phase out all substances of very high concern present in marketed products at a quantity of more than 0.1% by 2030, whenever feasible.\n\nIn 2022, Solvay announced the next step in our commitment to voluntarily phase out the use of fluorosurfactants globally: by 2026 we will manufacture nearly 100% of our fluoropolymers without fluorosurfactants, at our Spinetta Marengo site in Italy. One small product line, critical for the semiconductor and energy industries and representing less than 1% of production volume, will require further research and development to completely phase out the use of fluorosurfactants. A tightly-controlled, closed-loop and zero liquid discharge production process will be used for this production line.\n\nThe use of fluorosurfactants as process aids in the manufacturing of some fluoropolymers represents a global challenge for the industry. However, since 2019, Solvay has quadrupled our investment in research and innovation to develop new non-fluorosurfactant technologies. In July 2021, Solvay successfully discontinued the use of fluorosurfactants in the United States, where different products were able to be converted and qualified by customers.",

Solvay recently announced an investment of an additional \u20ac40 million in new technology at our Spinetta Marengo site to enhance our water treatment systems to ensure the removal of fluorosurfactant emissions to close to 100%, a level known as \"technical zero\".\n\n## 6.8.  Critical incident risk management\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURE 2-27 3-3 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 12 13\n\n## 6.8.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay's reporting of Process Safety Incidents is aligned with the globally harmonized metrics from the ICCA (International Council of Chemical Associations) and Cefic (European Chemical Industry Council). The Process Safety Incident rate (PSI rate) corresponds to the number of Process Safety Incidents per 100 Full Time Equivalent employees, including employees and contractors and assuming 2,000 working hours per worker, per year. This rate is monitored and enables benchmarking with peers.\n\nTransport Safety Incidents are incidents occurring during the movement of a chemical product such as:/uni00A0\n\n- \u00b7 loading or unloading at a Solvay site;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 circulating inside a Solvay site in a vehicle, on the way in or out of the site;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 circulating on public roads, rail, air, inland waterways or sea;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 loading or unloading at an off-site location, if Solvay or a logistics provider contracted by Solvay is performing the loading or unloading.\n\n## 6.8.2. Management approach\n\n## Process safety\n\nProcess Safety Management is a management system for designing and operating industrial processes that handle large quantities of hazardous chemicals. For preventing and controlling incidents in industrial processes, Solvay applies the Process Safety Management Principles on all industrial sites, regardless of whether the site is covered by regulatory requirements./uni00A0\n\n## Key elements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Completion of Process Hazard Analyses to identify high-risk situations. These are performed on each unit with a unique risk matrix to quantify the risk level of every potential accidental scenario, combining severity and probability factors.\n- \u00b7 Activation of an Emergency Response Plan in case of severe incidents on site. Relevant internal and external parties are informed through the application of Solvay's crisis management procedure. If needed, the Corporate Crisis Cell (crisis alert duty 24/7) is also activated.\n- \u00b7 Systematic analysis of each incident is carried out as soon as possible, in order to identify root causes and implement preventive actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.\n- \u00b7 Central reporting of Process Safety Incidents. The incident severity - medium, high or catastrophic - is assessed by applying internal criteria, including consequences onsite or off-site, damage to the immediate vicinity and quantity of spilled material.\n- \u00b7 Publication of process safety bulletins for significant incidents, distributed to all sites. These bulletins are used by the sites as support materials for safety talks to increase the process safety knowledge of employees.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nThe major goal of the Transport Safety Management system is a reduction in incidents that could lead to catastrophic consequences. The main elements are :\n\n- \u00b7 regulatory watch and compliance with applicable transport regulations;\n- \u00b7 training;\n- \u00b7 selection process for Logistics Service Providers, based on hazard and risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 operational management of day-to-day transport operations, including loading and unloading;\n- \u00b7 emergency preparedness and response for levels 1, 2 and 3;\n- \u00b7 incident reporting and investigation;\n- \u00b7 auditing.",

These coefficients are an average of worked hours per employee per year calculated in 2018 in several countries. For the countries where no coefficient value was calculated, as no accurate data was available, a coefficient of 2,000 hours is applied. Contractors' work hours are reported monthly by all sites.\n\nIn 2022, a Process Safety Incident with high severity (direct cost above \u20ac2 million) occurred at our site in Green River, in the US. A fire broke out during the night. No one was injured, but significant equipment damage occurred on three centrifuge pumps.

Among those, eleven generated reportable cases of having exceeded an operating permit limit.\n\nOne significant incident with impact on the environment occurred on our site in Bernburg, Germany. A leak of ammoniated brine occurred in a pipe connecting two units. The liquid spread on the ground and was collected by the rainwater sewer. The ammoniated brine was discharged into the river Saale and about 300 fish died. Immediate and preventive actions have been implemented by the site to prevent this type of event from occurring again.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nAll medium, high and catastrophic transport safety incidents must be reported in the corporate reporting tool, with a detailed description and classification. Root cause analysis, including actions to prevent recurrence and lessons-learned bulletins are mandatory for all high and catastrophic severity incidents, and for medium severity incidents resulting in a fire or an explosion, as well as for HSPos (High Severity Potential) Incidents. These are low or medium severity incidents or near misses that might have been worse (high or catastrophic) if the circumstances had been slightly different.\n\n## TRANsPoRT sAFeTY INcIDeNTs\n\n|                 | Units   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Medium severity | Number  |      8 |      7 |\n| High severity   | Number  |      0 |      0 |\n| Catastrophic    | Number  |      1 |      1 |\n\nThe most severe incident reported in 2022 was:\n\n- \u00b7 Catastrophic: during a delivery of a Solvay product, a truck driver had an accident with a pick-up which did not yield right of way to the truck.

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSolvay (the 'Company') is a public limited liability company governed by Belgian law and listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris. The principal activities of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint operations, joint/uni00A0ventures and associates (jointly the/uni00A0'Group') are described in note/uni00A0F1 Revenue and Segment Information.\n\nOn February/uni00A022, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issuance.\n\n## MAIN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\n## Separation plan\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Group announced its plans to separate into two independent publicly traded companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Essential Co would comprise leading mono-technology businesses including Soda Ash, Peroxides, Silica and Coatis, which are reported as the Company's Chemicals segment, as well as the Special Chem business. These businesses generated approximately \u20ac6 billion in net sales in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Specialty Co would comprise the Company's currently reported Materials segment, including its high-growth, high-margin Specialty Polymers, its highperformance Composites business, as well as the majority of its Solutions segment, including Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma Performance, and Oil & Gas. These businesses combined generated approximately \u20ac8 billion in net sales in 2022.\n\nEach company would have a tailored capital structure that best supports its value creation objectives. Specialty Co would be committed to a strong investment-grade rating. The company would have full financial flexibility at the time of separation to fund its growth plan. Essential Co would maintain a prudent financial policy to support cash generation. The current investment grade rating of Solvay SA is intended to be preserved until the separation. Solvay SA is committed to offer current USD and EUR senior and hybrid bondholders the option to be transferred to Specialty Co in due time. The dividend at the outset is intended to be aligned with Solvay's current level.\n\nUnder the separation plan, Solvay's shareholders would retain their current shares of Solvay stock, which will continue to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris. The separation would be effected by means of a partial demerger of Solvay whereby the specialty businesses will be spun off to Specialty Co. Solvay shareholders at the time of separation would receive shares in Specialty Co pro rata to their shareholding in Solvay  SA. We expect the shares of SpecialtyCo to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris. The Company expects to structure the separation in a manner that would be tax efficient for a significant majority of shareholders in key jurisdictions.\n\nThe composition of the Boards and management teams, as well as naming for each company, will be provided at a later date.\n\nThe transaction is subject to general market conditions and customary closing conditions, including final approval by Solvay's Board of Directors, consent of certain financing providers and shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting, and is expected to be completed in December 2023. The Board of Directors of Solvac, Solvay's long-standing reference shareholder, has confirmed its support of Solvay's transaction. Refer to Critical Accounting Judgments on the accounting treatment of the separation plan.\n\n## Financial implication of energy price volatility\n\nThe volatility in gas and electricity prices experienced by the Group can largely be attributed to the conflict in Ukraine, which has impacted the financial statements of Solvay in several ways including:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased non-core trading revenues (See note F3 Revenue from non-core activities).\n- \u00b7 Substantial fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of energy-related financial assets and liabilities due to the price volatility in gas and electricity. As the fair value adjustments are on sale and purchase contracts of energy, they impact both assets and liabilities (See note F32 Financial instruments).\n- \u00b7 Increased raw material and logistics costs (See note F2 Consolidated income statement by nature).\n\nThe Group will continue to monitor the inflationary pressure and manage the impacts on the financial statements.\n\n## Portfolio management\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Solvay announced the acquisition of the 20% minority stake of AGC in the Soda Ash Joint Venture operated in Green River, WY, USA, building on its leadership position in trona-based soda ash production. At a cash purchase price of US$ 120 million, this transaction will be significantly value accretive to Solvay, with a post-tax cash return on capital in excess of 15%. The transaction was completed on May 4, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Senior Bonds\n\nOn September 1, 2022, Solvay decided to exercise its residual maturity call option on the 2022 \u20ac-senior bonds 1.625%, ISIN BE6282459609 (outstanding of \u20ac377.5 million out of the initial amount of \u20ac750 million). The exercise was implemented in accordance with the terms and conditions of the related prospectus.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, Solvay delivered a notice of early redemption in full to holders of Cytec's US$ 3.50% senior notes due 2023 guaranteed by Solvay with ISIN / CUSIP US23282AJ97 / 232820AJ9 in an outstanding principal amount of US$ 196 million. The redemption was implemented in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bonds. The redemption date was January 1, 2023, however, Solvay was discharged from its liability by the paying agent on December 30, 2022, when the paying agent received the funds.\n\n## CO 2 emission rights\n\nManagement practices related to hedging of CO 2 exposure were changed in the period, in view of both increased volatility in energy and CO 2 markets and the plan to separate Solvay SA into two independent groups. Consequently, the Group has reconsidered the conditions of the own use exemption and accordingly the related portfolio of CO 2 emission rights has been accounted for in accordance with the general requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) at fair value through profit or loss, and a profit of \u20ac322 million was recognized in 'other operating gains and losses'. As of July 1, 2022, the related portfolio of CO 2 emission rights has been designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship. (See note F4 Other Operating Gains and Losses and F32.B Financial Instruments)",

The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 were prepared in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0(International Financial Reporting Standards) as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and endorsed by the European Union.\n\nThe accounting standards applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 are consistent with those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A0 31, 2021. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time in 2022\n\nBelow are the standards, interpretations and amendments that became effective as of January 1, 2022 and which are relevant to the Group.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to IAS 37\n\nThe amendments specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs to include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labor and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfill the contract and costs of contract management and supervision). General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. The application of the amendment did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16\n\nThe amendment prohibits entities from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss. The application of the amendment did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. The application of the amendment did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition to the standards, interpretations and amendments mentioned above, no other standards, interpretations, or amendments applicable for the first time in 2022 had more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time in 2023\n\nDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 12 (the 'Amendment') . In May 2021, the IASB issued the Amendment, which narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Amendment should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability are also recognized for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. The application of the Amendment is not expected to have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time after 2023\n\nThe new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements and which may have an impact on the Group are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.\n\nOn September 22, 2022, the IASB issued Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16) with amendments that clarify how a sellerlessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, but are not yet endorsed in the EU. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on the current accounting practices.",

        "page_content": "On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1) providing a more general approach to the classification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the contractual arrangements in place at the reporting date. The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine whether, in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The amendments were originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, however, their effective date has been delayed to January 1, 2024 or later, but is not yet endorsed in the EU. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice and whether existing loan agreements may require reclassification.\n\n## 2. Basis of measurement and presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in/uni00A0millions of euros, which is also the functional currency of the parent company.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of accounting policies and the measurement of amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The areas for which the estimates and assumptions are material with respect to the consolidated financial statements are presented in the section/uni00A0Critical accounting judgments and Key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\n## 3. Principles of consolidation\n\n## 3.1. Consolidation scope\n\n## 3.1.1. General\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, and:\n\n- \u00b7 entities controlled by the Company (including through its subsidiaries) and that hence qualify as subsidiaries (see 3.1.2. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint operations (see 3.1.3. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint ventures (see 3.1.4. below);\n- \u00b7 entities over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) has significant influence and that hence qualify as associates (see 3.1.4. below).\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the investees so as to align their accounting policies with those of the Group.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of materiality, certain companies, which are not of a significant size, have not been included in the consolidation scope. Companies are deemed not to be significant when, during two consecutive years, they do not exceed any of the three following thresholds in terms of their contribution to the Group's accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 sales of \u20ac/uni00A030/uni00A0million;\n- \u00b7 total assets of \u20ac/uni00A015/uni00A0million;\n- \u00b7 headcount of 150 persons.\n\nCompanies that do not meet these criteria are, nevertheless, consolidated where the Group believes that they have a/uni00A0potential for rapid development, or where they hold shares in other companies that are consolidated based on the/uni00A0above criteria.\n\nIn the aggregate, the non-consolidated companies have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe full list of companies can/uni00A0be obtained at the Company's head office.\n\n## 3.1.2. Investments in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group has (a) power over an investee, (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. To assess whether the Group has control, potential voting rights are taken into account. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity. Non-controlling interests are initially measured, either at fair value (full goodwill method), or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (proportionate goodwill method). The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.",

        "page_content": "When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. Reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is considered to be the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture in accordance with IAS/uni00A028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures .\n\n## 3.1.3. Investments in joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In its consolidated financial statements, the Group recognizes its contractual share of the joint operations' assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, which is generally aligned with the ownership interest in the joint operations.\n\n## 3.1.4. Investments in associates and/uni00A0joint/uni00A0ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary, nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations . Under the equity method, on initial recognition, investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and the carrying amount is adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment of the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint venture) are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and (contingent) liabilities of the associate or joint venture recognized at the date of acquisition is goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.\n\nWhere a Group entity transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the relevant associate or joint venture.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group reviews its investments in associates and joint ventures for impairment. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group performs its analysis and calculates any impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognizes the loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## 4. Foreign currencies\n\nThe individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group entity are expressed in euros (EUR), which is the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entities' functional currency are recognized at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income under 'currency translation differences'; and\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see note F32 Financial instruments and financial risk management for hedge accounting policies).",

Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nGovernment grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of those assets. They are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at their expected value at the moment of initial recognition. The grant is recognized in profit or loss over the depreciation period of the underlying assets as a reduction of depreciation expense.\n\nOther government grants are recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related costs, which they are intended to compensate, are recognized. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\n## 6. Climate Change\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has considered the impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the Risk Report and Extra-financial Statements and the Group's progression towards the ambitious 2030 goals to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 30%, an annual pace aligned with the Paris Agreement objectives, and to phase-out the use of coal for energy where renewable alternatives exist.\n\nIn October 2021, the Group also published its ambitions to become carbon neutral by 2040 for all businesses except Soda Ash, which is targeted to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nSolvay plans to invest up to \u20ac1 billion to reach carbon neutrality by 2040 for all its businesses other than Soda Ash with an additional investment of approximately \u20ac1 billion identified for Soda Ash to pave its path towards full carbon neutrality for the Group before 2050. These investments will be partially supported by non-recourse financing and government subsidies, enabling Solvay to also continue to invest in its growth initiatives. Further studies on technology innovation will determine the future investment needs beyond 2040.\n\nSince 2015 the Group has adopted an internal carbon price and it has imputed that as an input cost into all investment decisions, irrespective of prevailing market prices. The internal cost was originally set at \u20ac25 per metric ton in 2015, and was doubled to \u20ac50 in 2019. In 2021 it was then decided to be raised to \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 with implementation in 2022. This approach ensures that all investments contribute positively to the resilience of the Group in the face of climate change risk and are also oriented towards achieving carbon neutrality.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn addition to the strategic direction, policies and commitments, it is important to note that Solvay is taking concrete actions aligned with its climate change commitments. These are extensively developed in the Sustainability Report. As an example of the Group's commitment to phase out of coal in the Soda Ash business, several projects were initiated comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 The construction of two waste-wood boilers accounted for as finance leases in Rheinberg, Germany; the first of the two boilers was commissioned in 2021..\n- \u00b7 In Devnya, Bulgaria, a variety of renewable sources including sunflower husk pellets will be used to power production processes at our largest soda ash European site and reduce emissions related to energy production by 20%.\n- \u00b7 Already equipped with a waste to energy power plant since 2006, we recently invested a further \u20ac48 million to modernize our gas cogeneration unit in Bernburg, Germany, to maintain our low CO 2 footprint at the site.\n- \u00b7 In Italy an energy-efficient gas turbine was built at our Rosignano site. By implementing a cogeneration system that combines heat and power generation processes, we were able to keep up standard production capacity with less energy required, lowering the site's CO 2 emissions by 40%.\n- \u00b7 In Green River, Wyoming, USA, our calciners and boilers are switching from coal to gas, a readily-available local resource, which saves 280 kilotons of CO 2 per year. This is in addition to the new project Solvay launched to deploy a new breakthrough technology that will abate greenhouse gas emissions originating from Trona mining operations. This will reduce the site's greenhouse gas emissions by 28% while growing its capacity. It will also make Solvay the first company to implement regenerative thermal oxidation technology to cut emissions from a trona mine.\n- \u00b7 An equity investment at the Dombasle, France, site of which Solvay has a 10% share. The project is valued at approximately \u20ac225 million and is financed largely through non-recourse debt executed in February 2022 and government subsidies. Included in the investment are two refuse derived fuel boilers.\n\nWhen such investments are made, the Group verifies the useful life of the assets that are replaced and adjusts the estimated useful life if necessary. For 2022, no material revisions were needed and there is no indication that any material amounts of existing assets would be impaired as a result of the investment plans in other fuel types in the future.\n\nThe Group is also actively working on sourcing its energy needs from more environmentally friendly resources including long-term renewable energy generation solutions both onsite and offsite at certain facilities. These include long-term solar and wind power purchase agreements generally accounted for as executory own use contracts. In addition, the Group has entered into long-term contracts to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates, which will cover almost one quarter of the electricity purchased and consumed in the United States. The latter are recorded in operating expenses.\n\nManagement has also considered the impact of climate change in making some key estimates within the consolidated financial statements, including the execution of the Solvay One Planet strategy, which is included in the budgets, mid-term plan and long-term forecasts, which are used to:\n\n- \u00b7 estimate future cash flows used in impairment assessments of the carrying value of non-current assets (such as intangible assets and goodwill) (see Note F24 Impairment);\n- \u00b7 estimate future profitability used in the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position), provisions, etc.;\n- \u00b7 estimate the long-term accounting assumptions, including CO 2 emission rights and energy prices for the energy intensive Soda Ash GBU.\n\nThe Group's CO 2 emission rights and energy prices (gas/electricity/coal) are an important element of the cost structure, especially for the Soda Ash business. The Group has hedged a significant portion of its expected use through 2030. The hedges were taken into consideration in the goodwill impairment test performed and the long-term assumptions considered the higher capex required by the energy transition of the business after the hedged period. Considering the significant headroom on the Soda Ash CGU, no sensitivity is provided. See Note F24 Impairment.\n\nThe same exercise was done for the other cash generating units and management believes there are no realistic scenarios regarding climate change today, which would lead to an impairment of these assets.\n\nIn summary, the Group's climate change considerations mentioned above did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments and estimates during the year. Further, the Group concludes that the climate change risk does not impact the going concern assessment for December 2022. Additional information can be found in Notes F21 Property, Plant and Equipment, F22 Right-of Use Assets and Lease Obligations and F25 Inventories.",

        "page_content": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\n\n## 1. Critical accounting judgments\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Group announced its plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, Essential Co and Specialty Co. The separation would be effected by means of a partial demerger of Solvay whereby the specialty businesses will be spun off to Specialty Co./uni00A0\n\nWhile the Group is actively taking steps to prepare for the partial demerger and/uni00A0anticipates that the transaction will be completed in December 2023, the Group considers the specialty businesses to not meet the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS 5) to be classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2022./uni00A0\n\nThis judgment is taken on the basis that the consent of certain financing providers and the approval of the shareholders has not yet been obtained. These approvals are anticipated to occur in the course of 2023. Management will further assess the criteria at each reporting period.\n\nNo other critical accounting judgments have been identified for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## 2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment tests on (groups of) CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and each time there are indicators that their carrying amount might be higher than their recoverable amount. This analysis requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The recoverable amount is highly sensitive to discount and growth rates.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F20 Goodwill and Business Combinations and F24 Impairment.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits.\n\nThe Group has \u20ac5,203 million (2021: \u20ac6,050 million) of tax losses carried forward for which no deferred tax assets were recognized. These losses relate to subsidiaries that have a history of losses, do not expire, and may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Group. The subsidiaries do not have any taxable temporary differences that could partly support the recognition of these losses as deferred tax assets. On this basis, the Group has determined that it cannot recognize deferred tax assets on these tax losses carried forward.\n\nFurther details are provided in Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position and F7.D Other Information.\n\n## Defined benefit obligations - General\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligations at December/uni00A031 as well as the annual cost can be found in note/uni00A0F31.A. Provisions for employee benefits. All main employee benefits plans are assessed annually by independent actuaries. Discount rates and inflation rates are defined centrally by management. The other assumptions (such as future salary increases and expected rates of medical care cost increases) are defined at a local level. All plans are supervised by the Group's central Human Resources department with the help of a central actuary to check the reasonableness of the results and ensure consistency in reporting. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.A. Provisions for employee benefits.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental provisions are managed and coordinated jointly by the Environmental Rehabilitation department and the Finance department. In case of environmental impacts stemming from historical production activities, generally, no provision is recognized for remediation works beyond the 20 years due to the inherent high level of uncertainty as to the timing and amount.\n\nThe forecasts of expenses are discounted to their present value. The discount rates fixed by geographical area correspond to the average risk-free rate on 10-year government bonds or the inflation rate if higher. These rates are set annually by the Finance Department and can be revised based on the evolution of economic parameters of the country involved. To reflect the passage of time, the provisions are increased each year at the discount rates described above.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.B. Provisions other than for employee benefits.",

This review includes an assessment of the need to recognize provisions, disclose contingent liabilities and/or contingent assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.B. Provisions other than for employee benefits and F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\n## Leases - Identifying whether a contract includes a lease\n\nThe Group enters into various contracts to obtain goods and services. Determining whether those contracts include a lease requires judgment. Elements that are considered include assessing whether or not there is an identified asset. To make the determination the Group considers whether or not it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of the asset(s) throughout the period of use. Additionally, the Group assesses the extent of its decision-making rights and the existence of any substantive substitution rights. All facts and circumstances relevant to the assessment are considered and the identification of a lease is determined with the support of the departments that have the relevant knowledge, and which mainly includes the GBU management. Refer to note F22 Right-of-use assets and lease obligations for the leases that were identified by the Group and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases .\n\n## Leases - Assessment of lease term\n\nDetermining the lease term requires judgment. Elements that are considered include assessing the probability that early termination options or extension options will be exercised. All facts and circumstances relevant to the assessment are considered, and the main ones have been described in note F22 Right-of-use assets and lease obligations. Lease terms are determined with the support of the departments that have the relevant knowledge, and that mainly includes the Purchasing department, and the Facilities department.\n\n## NON-IFRS (UNDERLYING) METRICS\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents alternative performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of the Group's underlying financial performance and financial position, as well as cash flows. These indicators provide a balanced view of the Group's operations and are considered useful to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies as these measures provide relevant information on the Group's past or future performance, position or cash flows. These indicators are generally used in the sector it operates in and therefore serve as a useful aid for investors to compare the Group's performance with its peers.See Glossary for definitions of adjustments (IFRS vs Underlying metrics) and Business Review for more information and reconciliation with IFRS figures.",

Those are disclosed in note F8 Discontinued operations.\n\n## NOTE F1\n\n## REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify the contract,\n- \u00b7 Identify the performance obligations,\n- \u00b7 Determine the transaction price,\n- \u00b7 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n- \u00b7 Recognize revenue when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nUnder IFRS 15, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\n\nSale of goods: Contracts can be short term (including based only on a purchase order) or long term, some have minimum off-take requirements. As the Group is in the business of selling advanced materials and specialty chemicals, contracts with customers generally concern the sale of goods. As a result, revenue recognition generally occurs at a point in time when control of the chemicals is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.\n\nDistinct elements: a good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e. The good or service is capable of being distinct); and (b) the Group's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e. The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\n\nThe revenue of the Group consists mainly of sales of chemicals, which qualify as separate performance obligations. Value-added services - mainly customer assistance services - corresponding to Solvay's know-how are rendered predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer.\n\nVariable consideration: some contracts with customers provide trade discounts or volume rebates. Trade discounts and volume rebates give rise to variable consideration under IFRS 15, and are required to be estimated at contract inception and subsequently at each reporting date. IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent overstatement of revenue.\n\nMoment of recognition of revenue: revenue is recognized when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. Substantially all revenue stems from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, i.e. The sale of goods. Revenue recognition for those takes into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has a present right to payment for the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has legal title to the asset;\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred physical possession of the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset (in this respect, incoterms are considered); and\n- \u00b7 The customer has accepted the asset.\n\nProducts sold to customers generally cannot be returned, other than for performance deficiencies. Customer acceptance clauses are in many cases a formality that would not affect the Group's determination of when the customer has obtained control of the goods. Revenue from services is recognized in the period those services have been rendered.\n\nThe Group sells its chemicals to its customers, (a) directly, (b) through distributors, and (c) with the assistance of agents. When the Group delivers a product to distributors for sale to end customers, the Group evaluates whether that distributor has obtained control of the product at that point in time. No revenue is recognized upon delivery of a product to a customer or distributor if the delivered product is held on consignment. Indicators of consignment inventory include:\n\n- \u00b7 The product is controlled by the Group until a specified event occurs, such as the sale of the product to a customer of the distributor or until a specified period expires;\n- \u00b7 The Group is able to require the return of the product or transfer the product to a third party (such as another distributor); and",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The distributor does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the product (although he might be required to pay a deposit).\n- \u00b7 Agents facilitate sales and do not purchase and resell the goods to the end customer.\n\nWarranties: warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Substantially all warranties do not provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, and are hence accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .\n\nLicensing: In case of performance obligations relation to licensing intellectual property (IP), the Group assesses if it grants a right to access the IP as it exists throughout the license period or a right to use the IP as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted. If the performance obligation is to grant a right to access, then the related revenue is recognized over the license period; otherwise, it is recognized at a point in time, i.e. when the license period starts or when the customer starts using the IP. The Group assesses if the license provided can be considered as being distinct in the context of the contract. If not, the license will have to be bundled with other goods or services provided in the contract. Currently the Group grants a right to use IP, which means that revenue recognition occurs at a point in time.\n\nAn Operating Segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Solvay's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## General\n\nSolvay is organized into four Operating Segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Materials offer a unique portfolio of high-performance polymers and composite technologies used primarily in sustainable mobility applications. Its solutions enable weight reduction and enhance performance while improving CO 2 and energy efficiency. Major markets served include nextgeneration mobility in automotive and aerospace, healthcare and electronics.\n- \u00b7 Chemicals host chemical intermediate businesses focused on mature and resilient markets. Solvay is a world leader in soda ash and peroxides and major markets served include building and construction, consumer goods and food. Its Silica, Coatis and Rusvinyl businesses are also high quality assets with strong positions in their markets.\n- \u00b7 Solutions offer a unique formulation & application expertise through customized specialty formulations for surface chemistry & liquid behavior, maximizing yield and efficiency of the processes they are used in while minimizing the eco-impact. Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma, Special Chem and Oil & Gas focus on specific areas such as resources (improving the extraction yield of metals, minerals and oil), industrial applications (such as coatings) or consumer goods and healthcare (including vanillin and guar for home and personal care).\n- \u00b7 Corporate & Business Services includes corporate and other business services, such as Group research & innovation or energy services, whose mission is to optimize energy consumption and reduce CO 2 emissions.",

As a result of that ruling, a total gain of \u20ac97 million related to operations from 2003 to the present date was quantified and assessed as recoverable before tax of \u20ac(26) million. Of that, \u20ac36 million were recognized under 'Results from portfolio management and major restructuring' mainly as the relevant period pre-dated the Groups' acquisition of Rhodia in August 2011 (see note F5 Results from Portfolio Management and Major Restructurings, Legacy Remediation and Major Litigations - included in line 'M&A costs and gains and losses on disposals')./uni00A0 The remaining \u20ac61 million were recorded as \"Other operating gains & losses\" as the period related to operations subsequent to August 2011 and still in Solvay's perimeter.

Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities are recognized following the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized with respect to the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures, and associates, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets other than tax loss carryforwards are analyzed on a case by case basis, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. For example, a zero taxable profit, after deducting the amounts paid to retirees under a defined benefit plan and for which a deductible temporary difference existed, can justify the recognition of the underlying deferred tax assets. Recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards requires a positive taxable profit during the year that enables the utilization of tax losses that originated in the past. Because of uncertainties inherent to predicting such positive taxable profit, recognition of deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards is based on a case by case analysis, which is usually based on five-year profit forecasts, except with respect to any financial company for which ten-year financial profit forecasts are considered highly predictable and are consequently used.\n\nThe corporate tax reporting team, which monitors the Group deferred tax positions, is involved in assessing deferred tax assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F7.C.",

        "page_content": "Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\n## Current and deferred taxes for the period\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes for the period are recognized as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognized outside profit or loss, or when they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in the accounting for the business combination.\n\nException to the above, as from January 1, 2019, the Group applies the amendments to IAS 12, that apply to the income tax consequences of dividends recognized on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period, i.e. January 1, 2018. In 2018, the income tax consequences of the coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity were recognized in equity. As a result of the adoption of the amendment, those income tax consequences are now recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## F7.A. Income taxes\n\nThe income taxes (net expense) recognized in the consolidated income statement increased by \u20ac(107) million in 2022 compared to 2021. The income taxes (net expense) recognized in other comprehensive income decreased by \u20ac10 million in 2022 compared to 2021, mainly due to the movement in employee benefit provisions (see note F31.A Provisions for employee benefits).\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current taxes related to current year                          |   -360 |   -236 |\n| Provisions for tax litigations                                 |     21 |     -1 |\n| Other current taxes related to prior years (a)                 |    -18 |      0 |\n| Current taxes                                                  |   -357 |   -237 |\n| Changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets (b)                |    177 |    127 |\n| Deferred tax income on amortization of PPA step-ups            |     35 |     37 |\n| Deferred tax impact of changes in the nominal tax rates        |      0 |     -2 |\n| Deferred taxes related to prior years (a)                      |     38 |      3 |\n| Changes in deferred tax assets O&G US (c)                      |    105 |     15 |\n| Other deferred taxes (d)                                       |   -214 |    -52 |\n| Deferred taxes                                                 |    141 |    127 |\n| Income taxes recognized in the consolidated income statement   |   -217 |   -110 |\n| Income taxes on items recognized in other comprehensive income |    -66 |    -77 |\n\nThe current taxes (net expense) related to the current year increased by \u20ac(121) million due to higher taxable profits in countries with high effective tax rates slightly offset by the reversal of provisions for tax litigation in Spain and in the US.\n\n(a) The current and deferred taxes related to prior years (\u20ac20 million) derive mainly from the changes in deferred taxes (primarily on foreign income book to tax basis) in the United States (\u20ac21 million).\n\n(b) In 2022, the change in unrecognized deferred tax assets amounts to \u20ac177 million resulting mainly from a revision of the forecasts of utilization of tax losses carried forward in the holding companies (\u20ac170 million).\n\n(c) The deferred tax assets on the goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets for Oil & Gas in the United States were written-down in the US tax unit in 2020.

These include the Pillar Two initiative, focused on the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate, with the possibility of top-up taxes being introduced in cases where jurisdictions do not comply with the minimum tax rate. The Group is currently assessing the accounting implications and the jurisdictions that could give rise to additional taxation as a result of the implementation of the Pillar 2 Model Rules in national laws, which is not expected to be material for the Group.\n\n## F7.B. Reconciliation of the income tax expense\n\nThe effective income tax expense has been reconciled with the theoretical tax expense obtained by applying to the pre-tax profit of each Group entity the nominal tax rate prevailing in the country in which it operates.\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                                                                 | 2022     | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Profit/(Loss) for the year before taxes                                                                      | 2,151    | 1,094  |\n| Earnings from associates and joint ventures                                                                  | 171      | 158    |\n| Profit/(Loss) for the year before taxes excluding earnings from associates and joint ventures                | 1,980    | 936    |\n| Reconciliation of the tax income/(expense)                                                                   | /uni00A0 |        |\n| Total tax income/(expense) of the Group entities computed on the basis of the respective local nominal rates | -546     | -284   |\n| Weighted average nominal rate                                                                                | 28%      | 30%    |\n| Tax effect of changes in nominal tax rates                                                                   | 0        | -2     |\n| Changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets                                                                  | 177      | 127    |\n| Tax effect of permanent differences                                                                          | 26       | 37     |\n| Gain and losses with no tax expense and income                                                               | 6        | 10     |\n| US taxes disconnected from profit for the year before taxes                                                  | -15      | -9     |\n| Changes in deferred tax assets O&G US                                                                        | 105      | 15     |\n| Provisions for tax litigations                                                                               | 21       | -1     |\n| Other tax effect of current and deferred tax adjustments related to prior years                              | 19       | 3      |\n| Tax effect on distribution of dividends                                                                      | -8       | -6     |\n| Effective tax income/(expense)                                                                               | -217     | -110   |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                           | 10%      | 10%    |\n\nThe weighted average nominal rate slightly decreased from 2021 (30%) to 2022 (28%) mainly due to the decrease of the withholding taxes on dividends. The high nominal tax rate is mainly due to elevated earnings in countries with higher nominal tax rates (e.g. Brazil, Italy).",

        "page_content": "The total offset deferred taxes of \u20ac374 million at year-end 2022 are \u20ac56 million higher than in 2021. The main changes in 2022 are related to the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets on employee benefit obligations: \u20ac234 million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac55 million lower than in 2021, explained by the decrease of postemployment benefits obligations following an increase of the discount rates;\n- \u00b7 deferred tax liabilities on provisions other than employee benefits: \u20ac176 million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac32 million lower than in 2021;\n- \u00b7 deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets: \u20ac(196) million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac78 million lower than in 2021. The decrease in these liabilities in 2022 mainly reflects:\n- -exchange rate impacts of \u20ac(18) million;\n- -the tax impact of \u20ac35 million of amortization in the consolidated income statement of the step-up of intangible assets resulting from Purchase Price Allocation;\n- -the reversal of the write-off of the deferred taxes on intangible assets for Oil & Gas in the United States for \u20ac49 million.\n- \u00b7 deferred tax liabilities on goodwill: \u20ac58 million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac55 million higher than in 2021 due to the reversal of the write-off of the deferred taxes on goodwill for Oil & Gas in the United States;\n- \u00b7 deferred taxes on operational and non-operational tax losses: \u20ac374 million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac112 million higher than in 2021 mainly due to:\n- -the revision of the forecasts of utilization of tax losses carried forward in the holding companies (\u20ac170 million);\n- -the newly created or utilized deferred tax on tax losses for \u20ac(109) million;\n- -the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses up to \u20ac45 million in Luxembourg considering an increase of the taxable temporary differences in the same Tax Group.\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets on other temporary differences: \u20ac(66) million at year-end 2022 - \u20ac86 million lower than in 2021 mainly due to the recognition of the CO 2 emission rights contracts for \u20ac(75) million and the taxable temporary differences in Luxembourg for \u20ac(45) million offset by the use of deferred taxes related to the Brazilian PIS/COFINs credits recognized in 2021 for \u20ac20 million and the changes in deferred taxes (mainly on foreign income book to tax basis) in the United States for \u20ac21 million.\n\nAt year-end 2022, \u20ac(56) million for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings were recognized in the Other Temporary differences. An amount of \u20ac/uni00A032 million was not recognized because the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nRecognized deferred taxes for which utilization depends on future taxable profits in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences within entities that have suffered a tax loss in either current or preceding years in the related tax jurisdiction, amount to \u20ac134/uni00A0million. This recognition is supported by favorable expectations of future taxable profits.\n\n## F7.D. Other information\n\nFor the majority of the Group's tax loss carryforwards, no deferred tax assets have been recognized. The unrecognized tax losses are mainly located in countries where they can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe tax losses carried forward generating deferred tax assets are given below by expiration date.\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Within 1 year                                                                       | 0      | 15     |\n| Within 2 years                                                                      | 1      | 16     |\n| Within 3 years                                                                      | 1      | 2      |\n| Within 4 years                                                                      | 0      | 2      |\n| Within 5 or more years                                                              | 12     | 28     |\n| No time limit                                                                       | 1,402  | 974    |\n| Total of losses carried forward which have generated recognized deferred tax assets | 1,417  | 1,037  |\n| Tax losses carried forward for which no deferred tax assets were recognized         | 5,203  | 6,050  |\n| Total of tax losses carried forward                                                 | 6,620  | 7,087  |\n\nThe tax losses carried forward of \u20ac/uni00A01,417/uni00A0million (\u20ac1,037 million in 2021) have generated deferred tax assets for \u20ac/uni00A0374/uni00A0million (\u20ac263 million in 2021).\n\nThe increase of tax losses carried forward which have generated deferred tax assets, is largely due to the revised forecast for the holding company in France.",

The weighted average number of ordinary shares excludes the treasury shares held by the Group over the reporting period.\n\nThe diluted earnings per share are obtained by dividing profit for the year, adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, also adjusted by the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares attached to the issuance of share options.\n\nThe number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated for the weighted average number of share options outstanding during the reporting period as the difference between the average market price of ordinary shares during the reporting period and the exercise price of the share option. Share options have a dilutive effect only when the average market price is above the exercise price (share options are 'in the money').\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, there were no adjusting elements to the profit for the year (Solvay share).\n\nBasic and diluted amounts per share for discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Number of shares (in units)\n\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares (basic)\n\n/uni00A0\n\n103,744,461\n\n/uni00A0\n\n103,527,423\n\nDilution effect\n\n/uni00A0\n\n398,745\n\n/uni00A0\n\n260,419\n\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares (diluted)\n\n/uni00A0\n\n104,143,206\n\n/uni00A0\n\n103,787,842\n\n|                                                                                               | 2022      | 2022      | 2021    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n|                                                                                               | Basic     | Diluted   | Basic   | Diluted |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year (Solvay share) including discontinued operations (in \u20ac  thousands) | 1,905,416 | 1,905,416 | 947,738 | 947,738 |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year (Solvay share) excluding discontinued operations (in \u20ac  thousands) | 1,905,150 | 1,905,150 | 943,177 | 943,177 |\n| Earnings per share (including discontinued operations) (in \u20ac)                                 | 18.37     | 18.30     | 9.15    | 9.13    |\n| Earnings per share (excluding discontinued operations) (in \u20ac)                                 | 18.36     | 18.29     | 9.11    | 9.09    |\n\nFull data per share, including dividend per share, can be found in the Business Review section.\n\n2022\n\n2021",

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period except when the impact of applying the average rate is materially different from applying the spot rate at the respective transactions' dates, in which case the latter is applied. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income as 'currency translation differences'.\n\nCurrency translation differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss, on:\n\n- \u00b7 a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a partial disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation. In this case, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognized, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation, when the retained interest is a financial asset. In this case, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 a partial disposal of an interest in a joint venture or an associate that includes a foreign operation and that continues to be accounted for as a joint venture or an associate. In this case, a proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIn case of a partial disposal of a subsidiary (i.e. No loss of control) that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is reattributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIn case of (a) a capital decrease of a subsidiary without loss of control, or (b) a capital decrease of an equity method investee or a joint operation without modification of the share of equity interest held in that investee, then no accumulated exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated into the Group's presentation currency at the closing rate.\n\nThe total currency translation gain amounts to \u20ac/uni00A0304 million in 2022, and only relates to the Group's share (2021: gain of \u20ac/uni00A0508/uni00A0million). They are linked to the revaluation of the US dollar (\u20ac260 million) (2021: \u20ac331 million), Chinese Renminbi (\u20ac(40) million) (2021: \u20ac83 million), the Brazilian Real (\u20ac38 million) (2021: \u20ac11 million), the Russian ruble (\u20ac22 million) (2021: \u20ac21 million), compared to the Euro.\n\n## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\n(CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS)\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F11\n\n## DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND/uni00A0IMPAIRMENTS\n\nIn 2022 total depreciation, amortization and impairment losses (reversal) amount to \u20ac923 million (\u20ac849 million in 2021), of which:\n\nStraight-line depreciation and amortization of \u20ac/uni00A0948/uni00A0million (\u20ac906/uni00A0million in 2021) for continuing operations recorded in:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of goods sold \u20ac/uni00A0604/uni00A0million (\u20ac564/uni00A0million in 2021),\n- \u00b7 Administrative costs \u20ac/uni00A085 million (\u20ac82 million in 2021),\n- \u00b7 Research and development costs \u20ac/uni00A096/uni00A0million (\u20ac100/uni00A0million in 2021),\n- \u00b7 Other \u20ac/uni00A0163/uni00A0million (\u20ac160/uni00A0million in 2021), including \u20ac/uni00A0146/uni00A0million (\u20ac147/uni00A0million in 2021) for PPA amortization (see note/uni00A0F4 Other operating gains and losses);\n\nIn 2022, the impairments include the impairment reversal of Special Chem assets for \u20ac37 million (see note F24 Impairment) and impairment losses of other non-performing assets for \u20ac(9) million.",

These deals are subject to margin calls. To cover the credit risk of the counterparty, brokers pay a margin call to Solvay in case the instrument is in the money for Solvay. If the instrument is out of the money for Solvay, Solvay pays a margin call to the brokers. The margin calls are presented as part of financial debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Cash flows from margin calls are recognized as financing cash flows that fluctuate with the fair value of the instrument. The actual settlement of these commodity derivatives is net of margin calls and the gross amount (including margin calls that are reclassified from financing cash flows) is recognized in operating cash flows.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F18\n\n## CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThe 2021 cash flow from discontinued operations amounts to \u20ac(12) million related to the Pharma business and Polyamides.\n\n## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF/uni00A0FINANCIAL/uni00A0POSITION\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F19\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. It is identifiable when it is separable, i.e. Is capable of being separated or divided from the Group, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. An intangible asset shall be recognized if, and only if:\n\n(a) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; and\n\n(b) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets acquired or developed internally are initially measured at cost. The cost of an acquired intangible asset comprises its purchase price, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.\n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at each year-end, and any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.\n\n| Patents and trademarks                 | 2-20   | years   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Software                               | 3-5    | years   |\n| Development expenditures               | 2-5    | years   |\n| Customer relationships                 | 5-29   | years   |\n| Other intangible assets - Technologies | 5-20   | years   |\n\nAmortization expense is included in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold, administrative costs, research and development costs and other operating gains and losses.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if (a) there is a trigger for impairment, and (b) annually for projects under development (see note F24 Impairment).",

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they/uni00A0are incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized if, and only if, all the/uni00A0following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 the cost of the asset can be reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical feasibility of the product has been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the product or process will be placed on the market or/uni00A0used internally;\n- \u00b7 the assets will generate future economic benefits (a potential market exists for the product or, where it is to be used internally, its future utility has been demonstrated);\n- \u00b7 the technical, financial and other resources required to/uni00A0complete the project are available.\n\nDevelopment costs comprise employee expenses, the cost of materials and services directly attributable to the projects, and an appropriate share of directly attributable fixed costs including, and where applicable, borrowing costs. The intangible assets are amortized as from the moment they are available for use, i.e. When they are in the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Development costs, which do not satisfy the above conditions are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Patents, trademarks and customer relationships\n\nThose intangible assets have mainly been acquired through business combinations. Customer relationships consist of customer lists.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets mainly include technology acquired separately or in a business combination.",

The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of acquisition) of assets transferred and liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs, generally through profit or loss.\n\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. The date the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.\n\nThe acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS/uni00A03 Business Combinations are recognized and measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A012 Income Taxes , and IAS/uni00A019 Employee Benefits , respectively;\n- \u00b7 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree's share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS/uni00A02 Share-based Payment ; and\n- \u00b7 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see paragraph below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date.\n\nThe measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and does not exceed twelve months.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising in a business combination is recognized as an asset at the date that control is obtained (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of:\n\n(a) the consideration transferred;\n\n(b) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; and\n\n(c) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree, over the share acquired by the Group in the fair value of the entity's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if there are any impairment triggers identified.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) in accordance with IAS/uni00A036 Impairment of Assets .\n\nA cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other group(s) of assets.",

        "page_content": "These tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of the assets or (groups of) CGUs with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a (group of) CGU(s) is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized on goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nAssets held for sale include their related goodwill.\n\nOn disposal of an operation within a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. It is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained, unless another method better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## Goodwill - overview\n\n| In \u20ac million                     | Total   |\n|----------------------------------|---------|\n| December 31, 2020                | 3,265   |\n| Currency translation differences | 115     |\n| Disposals                        | -1      |\n| December 31, 2021                | 3,379   |\n| Currency translation differences | 94      |\n| December 31, 2022                | 3,472   |\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, the currency translation differences mainly relate to goodwill expressed in US dollars.\n\n## Goodwill by (groups of) CGU(s)\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n2022\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n| In \u20ac million                        | At beginning of  the period   | Disposals   | Currency translation  differences   | At the end of  the period   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Operating segments - Groups of CGUs | /uni00A0                      | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                    |\n| Materials                           | 341                           | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                            | 341                         |\n| Chemicals                           | 121                           | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                            | 121                         |\n| Solutions                           | 264                           | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                            | 264                         |\n| (Groups of) CGUs                    | /uni00A0                      | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                    |\n| Composite Materials                 | 555                           |             | 37                                  | 591                         |\n| Novecare                            | 553                           |             | 12                                  | 565                         |\n| Technology Solutions                | 690                           |             | 43                                  | 734                         |\n| Special Chem                        | 210                           |             | 0                                   | 210                         |\n| Specialty Polymers                  | 179                           |             | 1                                   | 181                         |\n| Soda Ash and Derivatives            | 162                           |             | /uni00A0                            | 162                         |\n| Coatis                              | 82                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 82                          |\n| Silica                              | 72                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 72                          |\n| Aroma Performance                   | 49                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 49                          |\n| Energy Services                     | 50                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 50                          |\n| Hydrogen Peroxide Europe            | 21                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 21                          |\n| Hydrogen Peroxide Mercosul          | 14                            |             | /uni00A0                            | 14                          |\n| Hydrogen Peroxide Nafta             | 7                             |             | /uni00A0                            | 7                           |\n| Hydrogen Peroxide Asia              | 11                            | /uni00A0    | 0                                   | 11                          |\n| Total goodwill                      | 3,379                         | 0           | 94                                  | 3,472                       |",

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. If applicable, the cost comprises borrowing costs during the construction period.\n\nAfter initial recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The components of an item of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are depreciated separately. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, also taking into account the potential impact of climate change including the execution of the Solvay One Plant Strategy (see Note Climate Change in the IFRS general accounting policies). Any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.\n\n| Buildings                | 30-40   | years   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| IT equipment             | 3-5     | years   |\n| Machinery and equipment  | 10-20   | years   |\n| Transportation equipment | 5-20    | years   |\n\nDepreciation expense is included in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold, administrative costs, and R&D costs.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if there is a trigger for impairment (see note F24 Impairment).\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure related to items of property, plant and equipment is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Subsequent expenditure incurred for the replacement of a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is only recognized as an asset when it satisfies the recognition criteria mentioned above. The carrying amount of replaced items is derecognized.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement as incurred.\n\nRegarding its industrial activity, Solvay incurs expenditure for major repairs over several years for most of its sites. The purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the proper working order of certain installations without altering their useful life. This expenditure is considered as a specific component of the item of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be obtained, i.e. the major repairs' intervals.",

        "page_content": "## Dismantling and restoration costs\n\nDismantling and restoration costs are included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle or restore. They are depreciated over the useful life of the items to which they pertain.\n\nGenerally, Solvay's obligation to dismantle and/or restore its operating sites is only likely to arise upon the discontinuation of a site's activities. A provision for dismantling of discontinued sites or installations is recognized when there is a legal obligation (due to a request or injunction from the relevant authorities), or when there is no technical alternative than to dismantle, so to ensure the safety compliance of the discontinued sites or installations.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAn asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, an asset can also be identified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified. A substantive substitution right means that (a) the supplier has the practical ability to substitute the asset throughout the period of use, and (b) would economically benefit from doing so.\n\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether, throughout the period of use, it has:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset; and\n- \u00b7 the right to direct the use of the identified asset. This is generally the case when the Group has the decision-making rights regarding how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nThe Group's leased assets relate mainly to buildings, transportation equipment, and industrial equipment.\n\n## Lease term\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both:\n\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nIn its assessment, the Group considers the impact of the following factors (non-exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods, compared with market rates;\n- \u00b7 significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the contract;\n- \u00b7 costs relating to the termination of the lease, including relocation costs, costs of identifying another underlying asset suitable for the Group's needs, costs of integrating a new asset into the Group's operations, and termination penalties;\n- \u00b7 the importance of that underlying asset to the Group's operations, including the availability of suitable alternatives;\n- \u00b7 conditionality associated with exercising the option (i.e. When the option can be exercised only if one or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist; and\n- \u00b7 past practice.\n\n## Right-of-use asset and lease liability\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the lessor makes the asset available for use by the Group except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. The right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, and the lease liabilities are presented as part of financial debt.",

Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method, from the commencement date to (a) the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, in case the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term, or the lease contains a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, or (b) the earlier of the end of the useful life and the end of the lease term, in all other cases.\n\n## Lease liability\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the respective Group entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for early terminating the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to early terminate the lease.\n\nService components (e.g. Utilities, maintenance, insurance, \u2026) are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measured by:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to reflect the impact from a revised index or rate.\n\n## Leasing of Palladium\n\nThe Group uses palladium, a precious metal, for certain of its operations. Next to purchasing this palladium, the Group also enters into various 'leasing' agreements with financial institutions that give the Group the right to use palladium for a certain period and then return it at the end of the 'lease'. Based on our analysis of these agreements, these contracts are not in the scope of IFRS 16 Leases or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Due to the lack of clear IFRS guidance, the Group applied judgment to determine whether these rights and obligations shall be accounted for on a gross or a net basis. Considering that the Group bears no price risk during the 'lease' term and is not in full control of the asset (in accordance with the IFRS Conceptual Framework), the Group believes a net presentation gives a better view on the economic substance of the transaction. As a result, only accruals are recorded for the production losses and regeneration costs and the 'lease' fee is recognized within cost of sales. At the end of 2022, the total (gross) value of palladium leased still to be returned amounted to \u20ac59 million (end of 2021: \u20ac50 million) valued at the year-end closing rate.",

leases buildings that include office buildings, and warehouses. Those leases are generally long-term leases and may include extension options.\n\nNext, the Group leases transportation equipment that mainly consists of railcars and containers to transport the Group's products.\n\nIndustrial equipment mainly relates to utility assets. In 2022, additions include \u20ac27 million for industrial equipment, \u20ac23 million for railcars and \u20ac17 million for containers.\n\nLease contracts generally are negotiated by the local teams, and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Many lease contracts contain extension options and/or early termination options to provide the Group with operational flexibility. Such options are taken into account when determining the lease term and the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\n\nIf the Group exercised its extension options not currently included in the lease liability, the present value of additional payments would amount to \u20ac/uni00A0100/uni00A0million at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac143 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nLease contracts signed not yet commenced amount to \u20ac137 million at December 31, 2022 (\u20ac135 million for 2021) and mainly relate to a second waste wood boiler, steam turbine and auxiliaries in Germany, industrial equipment in France and rail cars in the United States.\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases amount to \u20ac134 million for 2022, of which \u20ac113 million related to payment of lease liabilities and \u20ac21 million of interest expenses. Information on the corresponding lease liabilities (\u20ac519 million) can be found in the note F33 Net indebtedness. Information on the finance expense related to lease liabilities can be found in note F6 Net financial charges.",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are allocated to individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate. /uni00A0 Future cash flows are adjusted for risks not incorporated into the discount rate./uni00A0\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\n## Assets other than non-current assets held for sale\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, CGUs or groups of CGUs, including goodwill, and equity method investees corresponds to the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal, and their value in use. The latter equals the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from each asset, CGU or group of CGUs, and equity method investees and is determined using the following inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 business plan approved by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performances, forecast changes in the economic environment and expected market developments, including opportunity and risks resulting from climate change (taking into account the Solvay One Planet strategy - see note Climate change in the IFRS general accounting policies) and environmental regulations such as products phasing out. For further details, refer to the Risk Management Section. Such business plan generally covers five/uni00A0years, unless management is confident that projections over a longer period are reliable;\n- \u00b7 consideration of a terminal value determined based on the cash flows obtained by extrapolating the cash flows of the last years of the business plan referred to above, affected by a long-term growth rate deemed appropriate for the activity and the location of the assets;\n- \u00b7 discounting of expected cash flows at a rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital formula.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nWeighted average cost of capital (WACC) was computed using the same methodology applied in previous years after extensive benchmarking with Peers:\n\n- \u00b7 A short term WACC of 6.6% was utilized in 2022 (5.1% in 2021) to discount the expected cash flows of the initial four years, computed based on prevailing discount rates;\n- \u00b7 A long term WACC of 6.5% was utilized in 2022 (6.8% in 2021) to discount the expected cash flows of the fifth year and the Terminal Value, and is a rolling 8-year average of historical short term WACCs.\n\nThese WACCs are in the low range of the observed Peers' WACC estimates.",

        "page_content": "## Long-term growth rates\n\nThe long-term growth rates used in 2022 are based:\n\n- \u00b7 on the comprehensive review of the entire business portfolio performed in 2019 with the definition of the G.R.O.W. Strategy when each CGU was assigned to one of three agile business segments that became effective as from 2020: Materials, Chemicals and Solutions, with different growth opportunities, consistent with the long term growth rates of the market they serve and the Group competitive position in those markets; and\n- \u00b7 on the long term growth potential for Composite Materials and Technology Solutions assessed during the 2020 impairment test which remain very strong.\n\nAfter reassessment of the long-term growth prospects the Group concluded that the prior year rates are still applicable and were thus set at:\n\n- \u00b7 2% for the Specialty Polymers CGU and 3% for the Composite Materials CGU;\n- \u00b7 0% in the Segment Chemicals, except for Soda Ash and Peroxides, for which a 1% rate was set; and\n- \u00b7 1% for the other CGUs in the Segment Solutions (excluding Technology Solutions, for which 1.5% was used, and Oil & Gas).\n\nOther key assumptions are specific to each CGU (utility price, volumes, margin, etc.) and are based on approved budgets and mid-term plans.\n\n## Impairment Test 2022\n\nThe impairment tests performed at CGU level at December 31, 2022, were based on the budget 2023 approved by the Board and the Mid Term Plan 2024-2026 which reflect the economic rebound after the COVID crisis and the results of the structural cost saving measures adopted by the Group. They did not lead to any impairment of assets, as the recoverable amounts of the (groups of) CGUs were higher than their carrying amounts. More specifically, the difference between the (groups of) CGUs' value in use and their carrying amount (headroom) represented in all cases more than 10% of their carrying amount. As a result, for these (groups of) CGUs, a reasonable change in a key assumption relating to the recoverable amount for which the (groups of) CGUs is based, would not result in an impairment loss. For comparability purposes the sensitivity analysis to WACC and long term growth rates assumptions for Composite Materials and Technology Solutions are presented.\n\n## Composite Materials\n\n## In \u20ac billion\n\n## December 31, 2022\n\nSensitivity to:\n\nDiscount rate -1%\n\n1.7\n\n3.3\n\nDiscount rate +1%\n\n-0.9\n\n0.8\n\nLong term growth rate -1%\n\n-0.8\n\n0.8\n\nLong term growth rate +1%\n\n1.5\n\n3.2\n\n## In \u20ac billion\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\nAssumptions:\n\nDiscount rate = 6.8%\n\nLong term growth rate = 3%\n\n|                           |   Impact on recoverable amount |   Revised headroom |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Discount rate -1%         |                            1.3 |                2.4 |\n| Discount rate +1%         |                           -0.7 |                0.4 |\n| Long term growth rate -1% |                           -0.6 |                0.5 |\n| Long term growth rate +1% |                            1   |                2.1 |\n\nAssumptions:\n\nDiscount rate = 6.5%\n\nLong term growth rate = 3%\n\nImpact on recoverable amount\n\nRevised headroom",

The/uni00A0results of the impairment test indicated that no such impairment existed.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F25\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nCost of inventories includes the purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their/uni00A0present location and condition. The cost of inventories is determined by using the weighted average cost method.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of purchasing cost (raw materials and merchandise) or production cost (work in progress and finished goods) and net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price, less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## CO 2 emission rights\n\nWith respect to the mechanism set up by the European Union to encourage manufacturers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission rights are granted to the Group for free. The Group is also involved in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto protocol. Under these projects, the Group has deployed facilities in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the relevant sites in return for Certified Emission Reductions (CER).\n\nIn the absence of any IFRS regulating the accounting treatment of CO 2 emission rights, the Group applies the Trade/Production model, according to which CO 2 emission rights are presented as inventories if they will be consumed in the production process within the next 12 months, or as derivatives if they are held for trading. Energy Services is involved in CO 2 emission rights' trading, arbitrage and hedging activities. The net income or expense from these activities is recognized in 'other operating gains and losses' (a) for the industrial component, where Energy Services sells the excess CO 2 emission rights generated by Solvay or where a Group deficit is recognized, as well as (b) for the trading component, where Energy Services acts as a trader/broker with respect to those CO 2 emission rights.\n\nIn light of its centralized CO 2 emission rights' portfolio management, for emission rights that are substitutable between subsidiaries, the Group's financial statements reflect the Group's net position. If this net position is negative, a provision is recognized, measured based on the market price of the CO 2 emission rights at reporting date.\n\n## Energy savings certificates (ESCs)\n\nEnergy savings certificates are presented as inventory items in Finished goods. They are measured at weighted average cost. As their cost is not separately identifiable, and as they are a by-product, they are measured at their net realizable value upon initial recognition.\n\n| In \u20ac million               | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Finished goods             | 1,352               | 1,156               |\n| Raw materials and supplies | 838                 | 661                 |\n| Work in progress           | 21                  | 20                  |\n| Total                      | 2,211               | 1,837               |\n| Write-downs                | -102                | -92                 |\n| Net total                  | 2,109               | 1,745               |\n\nThe CO 2 emission rights amount to \u20ac57 million at the end of 2022. \u20ac16 million are included in the inventories (for 2022 obligations) and \u20ac41 million are reported under Other non-current assets (for obligations after 2022).

The group includes goodwill acquired in a business combination if the group is a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, or if it is an operation within such a cash-generating unit.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For a sale to be highly probable, management should be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan should be initiated, the asset (or disposal group) should be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, the sale should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell is recognized as an impairment loss. Depreciation of such assets is discontinued as from their classification as held for sale. Prior period consolidated statements of financial position are not restated to reflect the new classification of a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale.\n\nAt the end of 2022 and 2021 there are no assets classified as held for sale.",

The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of equity-instruments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these equity-instruments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of services rendered is measured based on the fair value of the equityinstruments on the grant date. It is not subsequently remeasured. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of share options likely to vest. The impact of the revised estimates is recognized in profit or loss against a corresponding adjustment in equity.\n\nIn its cash-settled plans, the Group acquires services by incurring a liability to transfer to its employees rendering those services amounts that are based on the price (or value) of equity instruments (including shares or share options) of the Group (namely through the issuance of performance share units). The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of share-based payments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these share-based payments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in liabilities. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of options likely to vest, with the impact of the revised estimates recognized in profit or loss. The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (further details are given in Note F9 Earnings per share).",

        "page_content": "## 1. F31.A. Provisions for employee benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## General\n\nThe Group's employees are offered various post-employment benefits, other long-term employee benefits, and termination benefits as a result of legislation applicable in certain countries, and contractual agreements entered into by the Group with its employees or constructive obligations.\n\nThe post-employment benefits are classified as defined contribution or defined benefit plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans involve the payment of fixed contributions to a separate entity, and release the employer from any subsequent obligation, as this separate entity is solely responsible for paying the amounts due to the employee. The expense is recognized when an employee has rendered services to the Group during the period.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans concern all plans other than defined contribution plans, and include:\n\n- \u00b7 post-employment benefits: pension plans, other post-employment obligations and supplemental benefits such as post-employment medical plans.\n\nTaking into account projected final salaries on an individual basis, post-employment benefits are measured by applying a method (projected unit credit method) using assumptions involving discount rate, life expectancy, turnover, wages, annuity revaluation and medical cost inflation. The assumptions specific to each plan take into account the local economic and demographic contexts.\n\nThe discount rates are interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized under post-employment obligations corresponds to the difference between the present value of future obligations and the fair value of the plan assets funding the plan, if any. If this calculation gives rise to a deficit, an obligation is recognized in liabilities. Otherwise, a net asset limited to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit plan and the present value of any future plan refunds or any reduction in future contributions to the plan is recognized. Therefore the amount at which such an asset is recognized in the statement of financial position may be subject to a ceiling.\n\nThe defined benefit cost consists of service cost and net interest expense (based on discount rate) on the net liability or asset, both recognized in profit or loss, and remeasurements of the net liability or asset, recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nService cost consists of current service cost, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and settlement gains or losses.\n\nThe interest expenses arising from the reverse discounting of the benefit obligations, the financial income on plan assets (determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the discount rate) as well as interest on the effect of the asset ceiling are recognized on a net basis in the net financial charges (cost of discounting of provisions).\n\nRemeasurements of the net liability or asset consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 actuarial gains and losses on the benefit obligations arising from experience adjustments and/or changes in actuarial assumptions (including the effect of changes in the discount rate) recognized in other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 Changes as a consequence of plan amendments, recognized in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 the return on plan assets (excluding amounts in net interest) and changes in the limitation of the net asset recognized.\n\n## Other long-term employee and termination benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits related to long service benefits granted to employees according to their seniority in the Group. Termination benefits include early pension plans. Other long-term employee and termination benefits are accounted for in the same way as post-employment benefits but remeasurements are fully recognized in the net financial charges during the period in which they occur.\n\nThe actuarial calculations of the main post-employment obligations and other long-term benefits are performed by independent actuaries.",

For 2022, the expense amounts to \u20ac59 million compared to \u20ac56 million for 2021.\n\n## B. Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans can be either funded via outside pension funds or insurance companies ('funded plans') or financed within the Group ('unfunded plans'). Unfunded plans have no plan assets dedicated to them.\n\nThe net liability results from the net of the provisions and the asset plan surplus.\n\n| In \u20ac million       |   December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Provisions         |                 873 | 1,371               |\n| Asset plan surplus |                 -62 | -248                |\n| Net liability      |                 810 | 1,123               |\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n| /uni00A0            | 2021   | 2021            |\n|---------------------|--------|-----------------|\n| Operational expense | 44 19  |                 |\n|                     | 14 13  | Finance expense |\n\nThe operating expense includes current service cost for \u20ac38 million (\u20ac43 million in 2021) (see also B.3.).\n\n## B.1. Management of risks\n\nOver recent years, the Group has reduced its exposure to defined benefit plan obligations stemming from future services by converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile (hybrid plans, cash balance plans and defined contribution plans) or by closing them to new entrants.\n\nSolvay continuously monitors its risk exposure, focusing on the following risks:\n\n## Asset volatility\n\nEquity instruments, even though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. To mitigate this risk, the allocation to equity instruments is monitored using Assets and Liabilities Management techniques, to ensure it remains appropriate given the respective schemes' and Group's long term objectives.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the carrying amount of the plans' liabilities. For funded schemes this impact will be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the plan assets.\n\nCorporate bond yields are highly dependent on global and local market situations, the decisions of central banks and the political situation. Events/uni00A0that are currently impacting the financial markets are:\n\n- \u00b7 the war in Ukraine and its geopolitical consequences;\n- \u00b7 high inflation due to increasing energy prices;\n- \u00b7 quantitative tightening applied by central banks to/uni00A0combat/uni00A0rising inflation.\n\nConsequently, yields in the major currency zones (Eurozone, the UK, and the US) have increased compared to 2021 (see Actuarial assumptions used in determining the liability)./uni00A0The result is a/uni00A0decrease in the Group's defined benefit obligations in 2022./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "## Inflation risk\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and/uni00A0as a result,/uni00A0higher inflation will lead to/uni00A0an increase in the benefit obligation/uni00A0(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). A/uni00A0limited/uni00A0part of the assets/uni00A0are either unaffected by or only partially correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the plans' net liabilities.\n\nThe inflation rate in each country is based on the Global Economic Consensus Forecast (GCF) with the exception of the UK, where the information is derived from the Bank of England. Long-term inflation assumptions have increased slightly in the Eurozone in comparison to 2021. In the UK, the outlook for the retail price index and consumer price index remains unchanged from 2021. The long-term inflation rate in the US, which is also based on the/uni00A0GCF, remains unchanged compared to 2021. (See/uni00A0Actuarial assumptions used in determining the liability)\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member. Increases in life expectancy will therefore increase the plans' liabilities.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nEspecially with respect to funded plans, the Group is exposed to the risk of external funding following regulatory constraints. This should not impact the defined benefit obligation but could expose the Group to a potential significant cash outlay.\n\n## B.2. Description of obligations\n\nThe provisions have been set up to cover post-employment benefits granted by most Group companies in line, either with local rules and /or with established practices, which generate constructive obligations.\n\nThe largest post-employment plans in 2022 are in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany and Belgium. These five countries represent 94% of the total defined benefit obligations and represent 95% of the total recognized plan assets.\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n/uni00A0\n\n| In \u20ac million    | Defined bene- fit obligations   | In %   | Recognized  plan assets   |   Net liability/ (asset) | In %   | Ratio plan assets  on defined benefit  obligations   |   of which asset surplus  recognized in the  balance sheet |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom  | 1,045                           | 27%    | /uni00A0 1,031            |                       14 | 2%     | 99%                                                  |                                                          0 |\n| United States   | 1,097                           | 29%    | /uni00A0 984              |                      113 | 14%    | 90%                                                  |                                                          0 |\n| France          | 722                             | 19%    | /uni00A0 309              |                      414 | 51%    | 43%                                                  |                                                         32 |\n| Germany         | 399                             | 10%    | /uni00A0 201              |                      198 | 24%    | 50%                                                  |                                                          0 |\n| Belgium         | 328                             | 9%     | /uni00A0 330              |                       -2 | 0%     | 101%                                                 |                                                         23 |\n| Other countries | 209                             | 6%     | /uni00A0 136              |                       73 | 9%     | 65%                                                  |                                                          7 |\n| Total           | 3,801                           | 100%   | /uni00A0 2,990            |                      810 | 100%   | 79%                                                  |                                                         62 |\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n| In \u20ac million    | Defined bene- fit obligations   | In %   | Recognized  plan assets   | Net liability/ (asset)   | In %   | Ratio plan assets  on defined benefit  obligations   | of which asset surplus  recognized in the  balance sheet   |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom  | 1,618                           | 32%    | /uni00A0 1,678            | -60                      | -5%    | 104%                                                 | 76                                                         |\n| United States   | 1,315                           | 26%    | /uni00A0 1,230            | 86                       | 8%     | 93%                                                  | 66                                                         |\n| France          | 953                             | 19%    | /uni00A0 372              | 582                      | 52%    | 39%                                                  | 50                                                         |\n| Germany         | 516                             | 10%    | /uni00A0 70               | 446                      | 40%    | 14%                                                  |                                                            |\n| Belgium         | 384                             | 8%     | /uni00A0 405              | -21                      | -2%    | 105%                                                 | 51                                                         |\n| Other countries | 229                             | 5%     | /uni00A0 139              | 90                       | 8%     | 61%                                                  | 5                                                          |\n| Total           | 5,016                           | 100%   | /uni00A0 3,893            | 1,123                    | 100%   | 78%                                                  | 248                                                        |\n\n/uni00A0\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nSolvay sponsors a few defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom; the largest one is the Rhodia Pension Fund (the Fund). This is a final salary funded pension plan, with entitlement to accrue a percentage of salary per year of service. It was closed to new entrants in 2003 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nBroadly, about 8% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 28% to former employees and 64% to current pensioners.",

        "page_content": "The Fund functions and complies with UK legislation under a large regulatory framework. The Pensions Regulator has a risk-based approach to regulation and a code of practice, which provides practical guidance to trustees and employers of defined benefit schemes on how to comply with the scheme funding requirements. In accordance with UK legislation, the Fund is subject to Scheme Specific Funding, which requires that pension plans are funded prudently.\n\nThe Fund is governed by a Board of Trustees. They manage the Fund with prudent and fair judgment. The Trustees determine the liabilities used for Statutory Funding Objectives based on prudent actuarial and economic assumptions. Any shortfall or deficit once these liabilities have been deducted from the Fund's assets must be reduced by additional contributions and in a time frame determined in accordance with the employer's ability to pay and the strength of covenant or contingent security being offered by the employer.\n\nThe Fund is subject to a triennial valuation cycle for funding purposes. This valuation is performed by the scheme actuary in line with UK regulations and is discussed between the Trustees and the sponsoring employer to agree the valuation assumptions and a funding plan. The last completed valuation was as of July 1, 2021, which established a fixed contribution rate of pensionable pay for active members plus a deficit recovery plan, which aims to fully fund the scheme's technical provisions by the end of 2027 in accordance with local regulations.\n\nThe guarantee provided by Solvay (\u00a3 330 million) is based on local regulations and exceeds the recognized liability - See note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees for more information.\n\n## France\n\nSolvay sponsors several defined benefit plans in France. The largest plans are the French compulsory retirement indemnity plan and three closed top hat plans. Indeed, as required by the 'Loi Pacte', the open top hat plan (so called 'ARS') was closed at the end of 2019 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe main plan is for all former Rhodia employees who contributed to the plan prior to its closure in the 1970s. It offers a full benefit guarantee based on the end-of-career salary; more than 99% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. This plan is partially funded.\n\nIn accordance with French legislation, adequate guarantees have been provided.\n\n## United States\n\nSolvay sponsors five defined benefit pension plans in the United States (two qualified plans and three non-qualified plans). A qualified plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that qualifies for special tax treatment under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. At this moment all defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants where newly hired employees are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan. Note that both qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded while the three non-qualified defined benefit pension plans are unfunded. The qualified plans make up the vast majority of the pension liabilities as of December 31, 2022.\n\nSolvay's plans are in compliance with local laws regarding audited financial statements, governmental filings, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance premiums where applicable. The plans are reviewed and monitored locally by fiduciary committees for purposes of plan investments and administrative matters.\n\nFor the US qualified plans, Solvay's contributions take into account minimum (tax-deductible) funding requirements as well as maximum tax deductible contributions, both regulated by the tax authorities.\n\nCertain eligible participants may elect to receive their pension in a single lump sum payment instead of a monthly payment.\n\nBroadly, about 24% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 11% to former employees for whom benefit payments have not yet commenced and 65% to current pensioners.\n\nIn 2022, in the United States Solvay contributed to two multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees. Each of the multiemployer plans is a defined benefit pension plan. None of the multiemployer plans provide an allocation of its assets, liabilities, or costs among contributing employers. None of the multiemployer plans provides sufficient information to permit Solvay, or other contributing employers, to account for the multiemployer plan as a defined benefit plan. Accordingly, the company accounts for its participation in each of the multiemployer plans as if they were a defined contribution plan. For multiemployer plans, during 2022 and 2021, the annual contributions paid were less than \u20ac1 million.\n\n## Germany\n\nSolvay sponsors various defined benefit plans in Germany. The largest plans are a closed final-pay plan and an open cash balance plan. Broadly, about 70% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. These plans are partially funded; an additional voluntary contribution of \u20ac155 million to the Contractual Trust Agreement was paid in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Belgium\n\nSolvay sponsors two defined benefit plans in Belgium. These are funded pension plans. The plan for executives has been closed since the end of 2006, and the plan for the White and Blue collars has been closed since 2004. The past service benefits provided under these plans continue to be adapted each year considering annual salary increase and inflation ('Dynamic management'). In accordance with market practice in Belgium, because of favorable retirement lump sum taxation, most benefits are paid as lump sum.\n\nFurthermore, Solvay sponsors two open defined contribution plans, classified as defined benefit plans for accounting purposes due to the minimum guarantees explained hereafter. These are funded pension plans which are open since the beginning of 2007 for the one in favor of the executives and since the beginning of 2005 for the one in favor of the White and Blue collars. Participants may choose to invest their contributions amongst four different investment funds (from 'Prudent' to 'Dynamic'). However, regardless of their choices, the Belgian law foresees that the employer must guarantee a return on employer contribution and on personal contribution, creating that way a potential liability for the Group. Since 2016 the return has been fixed at 1.75% for both types of contributions, at the minimum of the range provided by law since January 1, 2016 (1.75% to 3.75%). At the end of 2022, net liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position concerning these plans is not material.\n\nSolvay's plans are administered through the Solvay Pension Fund that operates in compliance with local laws regarding minimum funding, investments principles, audited financial statements, governmental filings, and governance principles. The Pension Fund is managed through a General Assembly and a Board of Directors delegating day-to-day activities to an operational committee.\n\nSolvay sponsors a few other smaller pension plans. All these plans are insured.\n\n## Other Plans\n\nThe majority of the obligations relate to pension plans. In some countries (mainly the United States), there are also post-employment medical plans, which represent 4% (4% in 2021) of the total defined benefit obligation.\n\n## B.3.

This assumption includes impacts of both inflation and merit increases.\n\nThe pension growth assumption defines the expected future adjustments for these annuity payments. The plan defines how these annuity payments will be adjusted, and might be linked to inflation. Pension growth assumptions mainly apply for the defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThe long term inflation assumption is presented separately as salary growth and pension growth assumptions encompass more variables than inflation.\n\n|                                           | Eurozone      | Eurozone      | UK            | UK            | USA           | USA           |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                           | 2022          | 2021          | 2022          | 2021          | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Discount rates                            | 3.75%         | 1.00%         | 4.75%         | 2.00%         | 5.00%         | 2.75%         |\n| Expected rates of future salary increases | 2.00% - 4.25% | 1.75% - 4.00% | 2.50% - 3.00% | 2.50% - 3.00% | 3.00% - 3.50% | 3.00% - 3.50% |\n| Inflation                                 | 2.00% - 2.50% | 1.75% - 2.00% | 3.00%         | 3.00%         | 2.50%         | 2.50%         |\n| Expected rates of pension growth          | 0.00% - 2.50% | 0.00% - 2.00% | 2.80%         | 2.85%         | NA            | NA            |",

Provisions other than for employee benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## General\n\nProvisions are recognized when (a) the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, (b) it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount is the present value of expenditures required to settle the obligation. Impacts of changes in discount rates are generally recognized in the financial result.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received when the Group settles the obligation.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\n\n## Environmental remediation costs\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are mainly related to non-ongoing activities (shut-down sites, discontinued activities or divested activities where Solvay maintains certain commitments) and, to a lower extent, to ongoing activities (see comments below).\n\nAn environmental provision is recognized, in accordance to IAS 37, when there is a current legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events which will result in a probable outflow of resources (expenses / cash outs) to settle it and for which a reliable estimate of such outflows and timing can be made.\n\nThe environmental expenses encompass, but are not limited to, the following key matters\n\n- \u00b7 Sampling and analytical costs for soil and ground water monitoring\n- \u00b7 Cost related to dismantling when required to meet a remediation or permit obligation\n- \u00b7 Asbestos removal when obligated by regulation\n- \u00b7 Environmental investigations and studies (Risk Assessments, Phase I and II soil and groundwater)\n\nThe closing amount of the environmental provisions is based on the net present value of the future cash flows needed, for current and future years, to settle remediation obligations. Forecast expenditures are based on external consultant estimates, where appropriate and possible. Future expenditures are forecast and revised biannually and validated quarterly by Solvay finance and suitably qualified industrial experts led by the Group Environmental Rehabilitation Director and benefit from inputs of legal department staff for the evolution of Environmental Regulations.\n\nIn the absence of probable obligations, a contingent liability may be disclosed to represent the future possible liability. In some cases, contingent liabilities cannot be quantified. See Note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nIn 2022, these provisions amount to \u20ac119 million, compared with \u20ac191 million at the end of 2021.\n\nThe provisions at the end of 2022 mainly relate to the restructuring charges for the simplification of all support functions in the frame of the Group's simplification and transformation program, including the strategic transformation measures.",

Most of these provisions, based on local expert advice, can be expected to be used over a 1-20/uni00A0year horizon and amount to \u20ac/uni00A0125 million;\n- \u00b7 the dismantling of the last mercury electrolysis activities was completed in 2019. The remaining provisions related to those activities will be used for the management of contamination of soil and groundwater, mostly over the next 20 years;\n- \u00b7 lime dikes (settling ponds related mainly to soda ash plant), dump at sites and third party dump sites (linked to several industrial activities). These provisions have an horizon of 1 to 20 years;\n- \u00b7 various types of pollution (organic, inorganic) coming from miscellaneous chemical productions; these provisions mainly cover discontinued activities or closed plants. Most of these provisions have a horizon of 1 to 20/uni00A0years;\n- \u00b7 Solvay Specialty Polymers made significant progress toward determining the scope of remedial activities pertaining to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) related to the West Deptford, New Jersey site. Due to recent technical studies and in cooperation with the local authorities, Solvay was able to reasonably estimate future expenses to address this remediation. As a consequence, a corresponding provision of \u20ac93 million was recognized in Q3 2022. The resulting cash outflows are expected to occur over a minimum 20 year period with 50% of the outflows occurring within the next 2 years./uni00A0 This provision reduces, though does not eliminate, the associated contingent liabilities previously reported.\n\nThe variation of Environmental provisions also were impacted from the revised assumptions of higher inflation rates, partially offset by the impact of higher discount rates reducing the present value of the overall liability by \u20ac(59) million. This effect, combined with the unwinding of the opening liabilities for \u20ac17 million resulted in a net decrease of \u20ac(42) million related to discounting.

        "page_content": "## NOTE/uni00A0F32\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## General\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognized when, and only when Solvay becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nAmortized cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nTrade receivables are initially measured at their transaction price, if they do not contain a significant financing component, which is the case for substantially all trade receivables. Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\n\nA financial asset is classified as current when the cash flows expected to flow from the instrument mature within one year.\n\nAll recognized financial assets will subsequently be measured at either amortized cost or fair value under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments . Specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 a debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding is measured at amortized cost (net of any write down for impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option;\n- \u00b7 a debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and (ii) has contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), unless the asset is designated at FVTPL under the fair value option. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 all other debt instruments are measured at FVTPL;\n- \u00b7 all equity investments are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with dividend income recognized in profit or loss. This classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to retained earnings.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments in partnerships of investment funds are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of these funds the Group determined that they were not eligible for the FVTOCI option and therefore are accounted for at FVTPL.\n\nFor instruments quoted in an active market, the fair value corresponds to a market price (level 1). For instruments that are not quoted in an active market, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques including reference to recent arm's length market transactions or transactions involving instruments which are substantially the same (level 2), or discounted cash flow analysis including, to the greatest possible extent, assumptions consistent with observable market data (level 3). However, in limited circumstances, cost of equity instruments may be an appropriate estimate of their fair value. That may be the case if insufficient more recent information is available to measure fair value, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment loss of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated based on the expected loss model, representing the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a default occurring as the weights. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.\n\nFor trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component (i.e. substantially all trade receivables), the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Those are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of those trade receivables, using a provision matrix that takes into account historical information on defaults adjusted for the forwardlooking information per customer. The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 60 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is fully impaired when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in the consolidated income statement, except for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this case, the allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost, except for:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, are subsequently measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 financial guarantee contracts. After initial recognition, guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the expected losses and the amount initially recognized.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nA derivative financial instrument is a financial instrument or other contract within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with all three of the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the 'underlying');\n- \u00b7 it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors;\n- \u00b7 it is settled at a future date.\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments (forward, future, option, collars and swap contracts) to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and commodity risk (mainly utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks).\n\nAs explained above, derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in income or expense, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments of the exposure to variability in cash flows with respect to a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges).\n\nA derivative with a positive fair value is recognized as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognized as a financial liability. Derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as non-current assets or non-current liabilities if the remaining maturity of the underlying settlements is more than twelve months after the reporting period. Other derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as current assets or current liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and embedded derivatives, in respect of interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, Solvay share price risk, and commodity risk (mainly utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks), as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship.\n\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. So to apply hedge accounting: (a) there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, (b) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship, and (c) the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nThe requirement under (a) above that an economic relationship exists means that there is an expectation that the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item will systematically change in the opposite direction in response to movements in either the same underlying (or underlyings that are economically related in such a way that they respond in a similar way to the risk that is being hedged).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated in a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAs long as cash flow hedge qualifies, the hedging relationship is accounted for as follows:\n\n- a) the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts):\n- (i) the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and\n- (ii) the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (i.e. The present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge.\n- b) the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge (i.e. The portion that is offset by the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is recognized in other comprehensive income;\n- c) any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument (or any gain or loss required to balance the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is hedge ineffectiveness that is recognized in profit or loss.\n- d) the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with (a) is accounted for as follows:\n- (i) if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the Group removes that amount from the cash flow hedge reserve and includes it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or the liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence it does not affect other comprehensive income;\n- (ii) for cash flow hedges other than those covered by i), that amount is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, in the periods that interest income or interest expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs);\n- (iii) however, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n\nMost hedged items are transaction related. The time value of options, forward elements of forward contracts, and foreign currency basis spreads of financial instruments that are hedging the items affect profit or loss at the same time as those hedged items.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging relationship (or a part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\nWhen the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge it accounts for the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, that amount remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until the future cash flows occur. However, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment;\n- \u00b7 if the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, that amount is immediately reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. A hedged future cash flow that is no longer highly probable to occur may still be expected to occur.",

If the hedged item is a financial asset (or a component thereof) that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall be recognized in profit or loss. However, if the hedged item is an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, those amounts shall remain in other comprehensive income. When a hedged item is an unrecognized firm commitment (or a component thereof), the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item subsequent to its designation is recognized as an asset or a liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in profit or loss.",

Equity instruments measured at fair value through OCI and through profit or loss pertain to Solvay's New Business Development (NBD) activity: the Group has built a Corporate Venturing portfolio, which consists of direct investments in start-up companies and of investments in venture capital funds. If the Group does not have significant influence or joint control, the investments are measured at fair value according to the valuation guidelines published by the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. The impacts of the direct investments are recognized in other comprehensive income while the venture capital funds are generally recognized through profit and loss.",

Optional derivatives are fair valued based on option pricing models, taking into account the present value of probability weighted expected future payoffs, using market reference formulas.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities)\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                                                         | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                                      | Carrying  amount    | Fair value          | Carrying   amount   | Fair value          |\n| Non-current assets - Financial instruments                                                           | 197                 | 197                 | 252                 | 252                 |\n| Loans and other non-current assets (except pension fund sur- pluses and long-term inventory balance) | 197                 | 197                 | 252                 | 252                 |\n| Non-current liabilities - Financial instruments                                                      | -2,148              | -1,994              | -2,321              | -2,465              |\n| Bonds                                                                                                | -1,994              | -1,830              | -2,112              | -2,256              |\n| Other non-current debts                                                                              | -42                 | -42                 | -55                 | -55                 |\n| Other liabilities                                                                                    | -112                | -112                | -153                | -153                |\n\nThe carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair values, due to the short term to maturity.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value in/uni00A0the/uni00A0consolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe table 'Financial instruments measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position' provides an analysis of financial instruments that, subsequent to their initial recognition, are measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. Financial instruments, classified as held for trading and as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges are mainly grouped into Levels 1 and 2. They are fair valued based on forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and interest rates of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. The equity instruments measured at fair value through OCI and through profit and loss are presented within Level 1 and 3. The fair value of the instruments presented under Level 3 is measured based on the guidelines recommended by The International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV)./uni00A0\n\nIn accordance with the Group internal rules, the responsibility for measuring the fair value level resides with (a) the Treasury department for the nonutility derivative financial instruments, and the non-derivative financial liabilities, (b) the Sustainable Development and Energy department for the utility derivative financial instruments and (c) the Finance department for non-derivative financial assets.\n\nThe Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. During the year, no such transfers have occurred.",

In Q2 2022, management practices related to the hedging of CO 2 risk exposure were changed in view of both increased volatility in Energy and CO 2 markets and the separation plan./uni00A0 Consequently, the own use accounting exemption was reconsidered and the related portfolio of CO 2 emission rights was accounted for in accordance with the general rules of IFRS 9 at fair value through profit or loss and a profit of \u20ac322 million was recognized. Subsequently, on July 1, 2022, the related portfolio has been designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship.",

This amount includes \u20ac/uni00A0(1) million for 2022 (\u20ac/uni00A0(3) million for 2021) of financial expenses not related to financial instruments that are excluded in this table from the line item 'Recognized in charges on net indebtedness'.\n\nThe loss on highly probable sales in foreign currency recognized in gross margin for \u20ac(31) million and the gain recognized on utility instruments for \u20ac/uni00A0238/uni00A0million are the result of the recycling of gains and losses of derivative financial instruments designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. The loss of \u20ac(31) million is mainly due to the hedging of the US$ currency and the gain on utility for \u20ac238 million is mainly related to gas procurement for \u20ac/uni00A0450/uni00A0million, coal for \u20ac55 million, partially offset by a loss on power procurement for \u20ac(267) million.\n\nThe change in fair value of financial instruments held for trading recognized in gross margin is explained by:\n\n- \u00b7 a gain of \u20ac259 million (\u20ac88 million in 2021) mainly due to the price increase of gas and electricity;\n- \u00b7 a gain of \u20ac2 million (a loss of \u20ac(4) million in 2021) mainly due to the price variation of CO 2 ;\n\nThe gain of \u20ac186 million (a gain of \u20ac3 million in 2021) recognized in other operating gains and losses is mainly explained by the CO 2 emission rights, previously considered under the 'own use' exemption. The remaining amounts are related to changes in fair value of equity swaps for long-term incentives.",

Capital management\n\nSee 2 Capital, shares and shareholders in respect of capital in the Corporate Governance statement chapter of this annual report.\n\nThe Group manages its funding structure with the objective of safeguarding its ability to continue as a going concern, optimizing the return for shareholders, maintaining an investment-grade rating, and minimizing the cost of debt./uni00A0\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of equity (including perpetual hybrid bonds (see note F28 Equity) and of net debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Perpetual hybrid bonds are nevertheless considered as debt in the Group's Underlying metrics./uni00A0\n\nBesides the statutory minimum equity funding requirements that apply to the Company's subsidiaries in the different countries, Solvay is not subject to any additional legal capital requirements./uni00A0\n\nThe Treasury department reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis under the authority and the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer. As appropriate, the Legal department is involved to ensure compliance with legal and contractual requirements.\n\n## F32.D. Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to market risk from movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other market prices (utility prices, CO 2 emission rights prices and equity prices). The Group's senior management oversees the management of these risks and is supported by the Treasury department (non-commodity risks) and Solvay Sustainable Development and Energy department that advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. Both departments provide assurance to the Group's senior management that the Group's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives. Solvay uses derivative financial instruments to hedge clearly identified foreign exchange, interest rate, index, utility price and CO 2 emission rights price risks (hedging instruments). All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. However, the required criteria to apply hedge accounting are not met in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is also exposed to liquidity risks and credit risks.\n\n## Foreign currency risks\n\nThe Group is a multi-specialty chemical company with operations worldwide, and hence undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, the Group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In 2022, the Group was mainly exposed to US dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazilian real and Japanese yen.\n\nTo mitigate its foreign currency risk, the Group has defined a hedging policy that is essentially based on the principles of financing its activities\n\nin local currency and hedges the transactional exchange risk at the time of invoicing (risk which is certain). The Group constantly monitors its ac-\n\ntivities in foreign currencies and hedges, where appropriate, the exchange rate exposures on expected cash flows (risk which is highly probable).\n\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilizing forward foreign exchange contracts or, when appropriate, other derivatives like currency options.\n\nIn the course of 2022, the \u20ac/US$ exchange rate moved from 1.1326 at the start of January to 1.0674 at the end of December (from 1.2270 to 1.1326 in 2021).\n\nA fluctuation of (0.10) to the US$/\u20ac exchange rate, would generate in 2022 about \u20ac180 million (\u20ac120 million for 2021) variation to the EBITDA. 51% of",

        "page_content": "this variation is at conversion level and 49% at transaction level, the latter being mostly hedged. EBITDA is the key non-IFRS metric for operational performance as defined in the glossary.\n\nAt the end of 2022, a strengthening of the US dollar vs euro would increase the net debt by approximately \u20ac87 million (\u20ac79 million in 2021) per 0.10/uni00A0US$/\u20ac fluctuation. Conversely, a weakening of the US dollar vs euro would decrease the net debt by approximately \u20ac72 million (\u20ac66 million in 2021) per 0.10/uni00A0US$/\u20ac fluctuation.\n\nThe Group's currency risk can be split into two categories: translation and transactional risk.\n\n## Translation risk\n\nThe translation exchange risk is the risk affecting the Group's consolidated financial statements related to investees operating in a currency other than the EUR (the Group's presentation currency)./uni00A0\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Group did not hedge the currency risk of foreign operations.\n\n## Transactional risk\n\nThe transactional risk is the exchange risk linked to a specific transaction, such as a Group entity buying or selling in a currency other than its functional currency.\n\nTo the largest extent possible, the Group manages the transactional risk on receivables and borrowings centrally and locally when centralization is not possible.\n\nThe choice of borrowing currency depends mainly on the opportunities offered by the various markets. This means that the selected currency is not necessarily that of the country in which the funds will be invested. Nonetheless, operating entities are financed essentially in their functional currencies.\n\nIn emerging countries, it is not always possible to borrow in local currency, either because funds are not available in local financial markets, or because the financial conditions are too onerous. In such a situation, the Group has to borrow in a different currency. Nonetheless, the Group considers opportunities to refinance its borrowings in emerging countries with local currency debt.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are classified into the two categories described below:\n\n## Held for trading\n\nThe transactional risk is managed either by spot or forward contracts. Unless documented as hedging instruments (see above), derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading.\n\nIn 2022, the notional amounts transacted to manage the transactional risk are:\n\n- \u00b7 a short position of \u20ac(666) million (compared to \u20ac(660) million in 2021);\n- \u00b7 a long position of \u20ac343 million (compared to \u20ac605 million in 2021)./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, the long position was explained by the need to convert US$ into \u20ac for the early repayment of \u20ac372.5 million on the \u20ac750 million senior bond in December 2021.\n\nThe following table details the notional amounts of the Group's derivatives contracts outstanding at the end of the period:\n\n| In \u20ac million                    |   Notional amount  (1) | Notional amount  (1)   |   Fair value assets |   Fair value assets |   Fair value liabilities |   Fair value liabilities |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| December 31                     |                   2022 | 2021                   |                2022 |                2021 |                     2022 |                     2021 |\n| Held for trading long position  |                    343 | 605                    |                   1 |                   3 |                       -1 |                       -2 |\n| Held for trading short position |                   -666 | -660                   |                   4 |                   4 |                       -2 |                       -2 |\n| Total                           |                   -323 | -55/uni00A0            |                   5 |                   7 |                       -3 |                       -4 |\n\n(1) Long/(short) positions (if the foreign exchange transaction does not involve the functional currency, both notional amounts are considered).\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge identified foreign exchange rate risks. It documents those as hedging instruments unless it hedges a recognized financial asset or liability when generally no cash flow hedge relationship is documented. Most hedges are transaction related.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Group had mainly hedged highly probable sales in foreign currencies (short position) in a nominal amount of US$ 839 million (\u20ac786 million) and JP\u00a5 15,902 million (\u20ac113 million). All cash flow hedge contracts that exist at the end of December 2022 will be settled within the next 12 months, and will impact profit or loss during that period.",

Therefore, ineffectiveness could/uni00A0 arise with the result that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk and the hedging instrument do not offset within a period. The sources of hedge ineffectiveness/uni00A0that could potentially affect the hedging relationship during its term are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 A reduction in the amount of the forecast sales resulting in quantity or notional amount differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on different quantities or notional amounts.\n- \u00b7 A significant change in the credit risk of/uni00A0parties.\n- \u00b7 Timing differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are settled at different dates.\n\nIn 2022, no hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                    | Notional  amount of  the instru- ment  (1)                      |

Moreover, the Group purchases raw materials with a price formula referring to market indices (e.g. benzene). In order to reduce the cost volatility, the Group has developed a policy for exchanging variable price against fixed price through derivative financial instruments. Most of these hedging instruments can be documented as hedging instruments of the underlying purchase contracts. Utility purchase contracts at fixed price with a physical delivery for use in the Group's operations are qualified as own use contracts and constitute a natural hedge. Those have not been included in this note.\n\nSimilarly, the Group's exposure to CO 2 price is partially hedged by forward purchases of European Union Allowances (EUA). In 2021, forward purchases with physical delivery for use in the Group's operations were qualified as own use contracts (not derivatives). In 2022, in view of both increased volatility in energy and CO 2 markets and the plan to separate Solvay SA into two independent groups, the Group reconsidered the conditions of the own use exemption. Accordingly the entire portfolio of CO 2 emission rights forward purchases has been accounted for at the end of Q2 2022 in accordance with the general rules of IFRS/uni00A09, and a profit of \u20ac322 million has been classified as 'Other operating gains and losses'. Subsequently, on July 1, 2022, the related portfolio has been designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship.\n\nFinally, some exposure to gas, coal and electricity prices may arise from the production of electricity on Solvay sites (mostly from cogeneration units in Europe), which can be hedged by means of forward purchases and forward sales or optional schemes. In this case, cash flow hedge accounting is applied.\n\nFinancial hedging of utility and CO emission rights price risks is managed centrally by Energy Services on behalf of the Group entities.\n\n2\n\nEnergy Services also carries out trading transactions with respect to utility and CO 2 .",

        "page_content": "Hedge relationships are seldom perfect. Therefore, ineffectiveness could/uni00A0 arise with the result that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk and the hedging instrument do not offset within a period. The sources of hedge ineffectiveness/uni00A0that could potentially affect the hedging relationship during its term are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 A reduction in the amount of the forecast sales resulting in quantity or notional amount differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on different quantities or notional amounts.\n- \u00b7 A significant change in the credit risk of/uni00A0parties.\n- \u00b7 Timing differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are settled at different dates.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, no hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIn the wake of the European energy crisis impacting gas consumption in several countries and due to the European Union's sanctions on the sourcing of gas and coal from Russia, the Group revised the expected activity of several of its cogeneration units in Europe in Q3 2022 with a view to both preserving business continuity and reducing gas consumption. These developments triggered the need to reassess the probability and conditions of future energy consumption at each site when updating the Cash Flow Hedge (CFH) documentation. As part of this reassessment, the Group identified certain hedges for which the underlying future energy purchases are no longer highly probable (but still expected to occur) or subject to modified purchasing conditions, resulting in those hedges ceasing to meet the qualifying criteria for CFH accounting during Q3 2022. The discontinuation of hedge accounting resulted in a favorable \u20ac39 million accumulated mark-to-market that will remain in Other Comprehensive Income with future recycling to the consolidated income statement as the underlying transactions occur (\u20ac18 million in 2022, \u20ac18 million in 2023).\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Group covers a part of its CO 2 emission rights in inventory by forward sales of CO 2 emission rights to a related party. The Group qualifies this hedging strategy as Fair value hedge. The change in fair value of forward sales are accounted in profit and loss, concomitantly with the revaluation of the CO 2 emission rights held in inventory.\n\nThe Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio for the underlying risk of the forward sales of CO 2 emission rights to the related party that is identical to the hedged risk component./uni00A0\n\nThe impact of the hedging instrument on the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022 is, as follows:\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n|                                 |          |              | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount   | Balance sheet  line item (s)   | Change in fair value used for  calculating hedge ineffectiveness   | Change in fair value used for  calculating hedge ineffectiveness   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| /uni00A0                        | Notional |              | Assets            | Liabilities       | /uni00A0                       | Assets                                                             | Liabilities                                                        |\n| /uni00A0                        | In Tons  | In \u20ac million | In \u20ac million      | In \u20ac million      | /uni00A0                       | In \u20ac million                                                       | In \u20ac million                                                       |\n| Fair Value  Hedge               | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0     | /uni00A0 /uni00A0 | /uni00A0          |                                |                                                                    | /uni00A0                                                           |\n| CO 2  emission  rights forwards | 86,500   | 1            | /uni00A0 -6       |                   | Financial  instrument          |                                                                    | -6                                                                 |\n|                                 |          |              |                   |                   | December 31, 2022              | December 31, 2022                                                  | December 31, 2022                                                  |\n| /uni00A0                        |          |              | Carrying amount   |                   | Balance sheet  line item (s)   | Change in fair value used for   calculating hedge ineffectiveness  | Change in fair value used for   calculating hedge ineffectiveness  |\n| /uni00A0                        | Notional |              | Assets            | Liabilities       | /uni00A0                       | Assets                                                             | Liabilities                                                        |\n|                                 | In Tons  | In \u20ac million | In \u20ac million      |                   |                                | In \u20ac million                                                       | In \u20ac million                                                       |\n| Fair Value  Hedge               | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0     |                   | /uni00A0 /uni00A0 |                                |                                                                    | /uni00A0                                                           |\n| CO 2  emission  rights forwards | 86,500   | -1           | 7                 | /uni00A0          | Inventories                    | 6                                                                  | /uni00A0                                                           |\n\nThe sensitivities of commodity derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 are presented below.\n\nThe sensitivities were defined based on the price levels and volatility levels of each commodity.

In 2022, a liability of \u20ac39 million, recognized for 2020 and 2021 PSU plans (in 2021, \u20ac24 million for the 2020 and 2021 PSU plans) corresponds to the best estimate of the amount due at maturity.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nSee the Financial risk in the Management of risks section of this annual report for additional information on credit risk management.\n\nThe Group continuously monitors the credit risk of important business partners.\n\nThe Group engages in transactions only with financial institutions with a good credit rating. The Group monitors and manages exposures to financial institutions within approved counterparty credit limits and credit risk parameters in order to mitigate the risk of default. For financial guarantees, see note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\nThe Group recognizes expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables: it applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables, using a provision matrix in order to calculate the lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables, using historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group classifies the customers and their related receivables in various rating classes, based on the risks' grading attributed to the customers and on the aging balance of receivables. As such, for all receivables overdue below six months, the Group considers percentages within a range between 0.005% and 4.204%, depending on the rating class. For all receivables overdue in excess of six months, the Group considers a rate of 50% or of 100%, depending on the rating class. The customer's grading is reviewed annually for customers assessed as low risk profile, and every six months for customers assessed as higher risk profile.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk at Group level because the receivables' credit risk is spread over a large number of customers and markets.\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables, financial instruments - operational, loans and other non-current assets is as follows:\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\nWith expected loss allowance, not credit-impaired\n\n| December 31, 2022 In \u20ac million                  | Total   | Credit- impaired   | not past  due   | less than  30 days  past due   | between 30  and 60 days  past due   | between 60 and  90 days past due   | more than 90  days past due   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Trade receivables                               | 2,098   | 68                 | 1,986           | 33                             | 6                                   | 1                                  | 3                             |\n| Trade receivables - allowance                   | -72     | -67                | -2              | 0                              | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                           | -2                            |\n| Trade receivables - net                         | 2,026   | 1                  | 1,984           | 33                             | 6                                   | 1                                  | 1                             |\n| Financial instruments -  operational            | 1,125   | /uni00A0           | 1,125           | /uni00A0                       | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                           | /uni00A0                      |\n| Loans and other non-current assets              | 312     | 12                 | 300             | 0                              | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                           | /uni00A0                      |\n| Loans and other non-current assets  - allowance | -11     | -11                | /uni00A0        | /uni00A0                       | /uni00A0                            | /uni00A0                           | /uni00A0                      |\n| Loans and other non-current  assets - net       | 301     | 0                  | 300             | 0                              | 0                                   | 0                                  | 0                             |\n| Total                                           | 3,452   | 1                  | 3,410           | 33                             | 6                                   | 1                                  | 1                             |\n\nThe Loans and other non-currents assets do not include the long-term inventory balance.",

If the option is taken, the Group's liability is assigned by the supplier to the partner bank. The value of the Group's liability remains unchanged. The Group assesses each arrangement against indicators to determine if the liabilities which suppliers have sold to the partner bank under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as financial debt. On December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liabilities met the criteria of Trade Payables.\n\nSolvay's liquidity amounts to \u20ac6.7 billion including \u20ac932 million of cash and cash equivalents on the statement of financial position and \u20ac/uni00A05.8 billion of committed fully undrawn credit facilities (\u20ac2.9 billion term loan in the context of the separation plan, \u20ac2 billion multilateral RCF due 2024, and \u20ac0.9 billion bilateral RCF, largely multi-year) unused at the end of December 2022.\n\nIn addition, Solvay has access to a Belgian Treasury Bill program for \u20ac1.5 billion and, alternatively, to a US commercial paper for US$ 500 million (no outstanding balance for both on December 31, 2022).

However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nContingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, the Group discloses the contingent asset.\n\n## A contingent liability is:\n\n(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or\n\n(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:\n\n- (i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\n- (ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements, except if they arise from a business combination. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nFinancial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nIn order to avoid double counting, only guarantees in excess of liabilities recognized or disclosures made elsewhere in the Group's consolidated financial statements are disclosed in this note./uni00A0 Regarding financial guarantees, all financial guarantees of the Group are presented in this note.\n\n| In \u20ac million                         |   December 31, 2022 |   December 31, 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Contingent assets                    |                  91 |                  91 |\n| Financial guarantees Rusvinyl        |                   0 |                  83 |\n| Guarantees for pensions              |                 378 |                 348 |\n| Environmental contingent liabilities |                 315 |                 301 |\n| Contingent liabilities               |                 693 |                 733 |\n\n## Contingent Asset\n\nFollowing an arbitration procedure that began in 2012, on June 22, 2021 the ICC Arbitration Court in Geneva (CH) issued a partial award in favor of Solvay Specialty Polymers Italy SpA, ordering Edison S.p.A. (Edison) to pay \u20ac91.632 million for the losses, damages and costs incurred up to the end of 2016 in relation to certain environmental issues at the Spinetta Marengo and Bussi sites, previously owned and operated by (Mont)Edison SpA and Ausimont SpA. A further phase of the arbitration proceeding, expected to end in 2024, will define the quantification of the additional losses, damages and costs from 2017 onwards, as well as the interests applicable to the amount awarded and the costs of litigation, to be reimbursed to Solvay Specialty Polymers Italy SpA. No income was recognized during either 2021 or 2022 in relation to the partial award, pending Edison's appeals against the enforcement of the partial award.\n\nOn January 23, 2023, the Group received a favorable ruling from the Court of Appeal of Milan which rejected Edison's appeal against the enforcement of the partial award, making it definitively enforceable in Italy./uni00A0 On February 8, 2023, Edison settled the \u20ac91.632 million partial award in full with Solvay./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "## Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe financial guarantees related to Rusvinyl, the joint venture with SIBUR for the operation of a PVC plant in Russia were released in Q3 2022 following the full repayment of Rusvinyl financial debt.\n\nThe guarantees for pensions are related to the main UK Pension Funds (\u20ac358 million) - See note F31.B.2. Description of obligations. Such corresponds to the amount by which the guarantee exceeds the recognized pension liability (as at December 31, 2022) or the recognized plan assets surplus as at (December 31, 2021). This guarantee applies to the pension liability measured based on a local UK regulatory basis (prudential basis) plus an allocation for market risk, which is higher when compared to the IAS/uni00A019 methodology. The probability of the guarantees being called is considered to be highly remote.\n\nContingent liabilities of \u20ac315 million above relate to environmental remediation matters that can be estimated with sufficient reliability.\n\nGenerally, in line with good business practice, we are not reporting any pending or threatened proceeding, which has not matured, and where the probability of existing or future exposure is unlikely or uncertain, where financial impact is not estimable and for which we are not able to quantify contingent liabilities.\n\nIn the United States, Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC (SpP) is a defendant in 35 separate individual and class action lawsuits relating to its historical use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The vast majority of these cases (30) are pending in the federal and state courts in the state of New Jersey, in the US, and the majority (27) are claims by private plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring or compensation for alleged personal injury or other alleged economic loss. Three (3) of the cases involve civil claims by separate US state governmental authorities-New Jersey, Michigan and Illinoisseeking various damages for alleged violations of state environmental laws, including natural resource damages. The State of New Jersey also seeks the environmental cleanup of PFAS pollution allegedly caused by a single operating facility of the subsidiary in New Jersey. Two (2) cases relate to allegations that contamination from the same operating facility caused contamination to a local municipal well. Finally, three (3) of the cases allege that products purchased from the subsidiary caused contamination elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the number of these cases remains low in comparison to other industry participants. Solvay continues to dispute the merits of these claims and defend itself accordingly. In all of these cases, the plaintiffs have the burden of proof against all defendants.\n\nSee note F31.B Provisions Other than Employee Benefits for additional information.\n\nIn Italy, there are several pending litigations:\n\n- \u00b7 (a) With reference to the Rosignano industrial site, certain criminal preliminary investigations continue to be pending before the Criminal Court of Livorno regarding the alleged contamination of certain areas outside the site;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 (b) With regard to the Spinetta industrial site, in December 2022 the Public Prosecutor Office of the Court of Alessandria closed the preliminary investigations started at the end of 2020 regarding certain alleged environmental violations of two Solvay managers. The Public Prosecutor Office should decide to request the dismissal of this provisional charge or alternatively the case should go to trial by the end of Q1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 (c) With regard to the Bussi industrial site, sold by Solvay in 2016 with the surrounding area sold in 2018, an administrative litigation is pending in relation to the identification of the polluter of the industrial site./uni00A0\n\nBased on the overall assessment, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the unlikely or uncertain probability of existing or future exposure, as well as undefined financial impact, which is not estimable at this time, no additional provisions have been recorded in association with these litigations and contingent liabilities cannot be quantified.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F37\n\n## RELATED PARTIES\n\nBalances and transactions between Solvay/uni00A0SA and (a) its subsidiaries and (b) its joint operations for the Group's share of the respective joint operations, which are related parties of Solvay/uni00A0SA, have been eliminated in consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

The outcome follows more than 10 years of legal proceedings in relation to Solvay's claims of environmental breaches by Edison, a subsidiary of EDF, in the context of Solvay's acquisition of the Italian company Ausimont in 2002.\n\nThe compensation relates to costs, losses and damages suffered by Solvay up to the end of 2016. Additional arbitration procedures are currently ongoing regarding costs, losses and damages suffered by Solvay from January 2017 onwards.

In addition to the recently obtained preliminary clearance from Russian governmental authorities, the potential transaction is still subject to several other regulatory approvals.\n\nThe Group considers that the Rusvinyl joint venture does not meet the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022 nor at the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements./uni00A0\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F40\n\n## LIST OF COMPANIES INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\nThe Group consists of Solvay/uni00A0SA and a total of 304 investees.\n\nOf these 304/uni00A0investees, 152 are fully consolidated, 7 are proportionately consolidated and 23 are accounted for under the equity method, whilst the other 122 do not meet the/uni00A0criteria of significance.\n\nIn accordance with the concept of materiality, certain companies (Other Investments), which are insignificant, have not been included in the consolidation scope.

The impairment assessment involves a comparison of the estimated value in use of the CGU to its carrying amount. The assessment is a judgmental process which requires estimates concerning the projected future cash flows associated with the CGU, the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC') and the growth rate of revenue and costs to be applied in determining the value in use.\n\nThis area is important to our audit because of the magnitude of the amounts, the judgments, and the technical expertise required to perform the impairment testing of long-term assets.\n\n## Summary of the procedures performed\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the Group impairment testing and processes;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated and challenged management determination of CGU's and allocation of goodwill to those CGU's for the purpose of impairment testing;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the methodology, clerical accuracy, long term growth rate and discount rate, by comparison to (i) peer-group information, (ii) the Group's cost of capital and (iii) relevant risk factors;\n- \u00b7 We tested the reasonableness of projected cash flows considering the Group's historic forecasting accuracy and compared these projections with the long-term plan as adopted and approved by the Board of Directors, including with respect to the impact of climate change and the alignment with the Solvay One Planet objectives;\n- \u00b7 We included our internal valuation specialist on our team to analyze and test the valuation model and the abovementioned critical assumptions used in the valuation model;\n- \u00b7 We analyzed and tested the sensitivity analysis prepared by management, to understand the impact of reasonable changes\n\n## for the year ended 31 December 2022 (continued)\n\nin the key assumptions on the available headroom for the three CGU's;\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the Group reconciliation of the value in use derived from the impairment tests to the market capitalization;\n- \u00b7 We considered additional impairment or reversal of impairment indicators and triggers by reading minutes of the board of directors' meetings, and we held regular discussions with the management and the audit committee;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the appropriateness and completeness of the disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IAS 36.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in Belgium and for such internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, and provide, if applicable, information on matters impacting going concern, The Board of Directors should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease business operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit.

However, a statutory audit does not provide assurance about the future viability of the Company and the Group, nor about the efficiency or effectiveness with which the board of directors has taken or will undertake the Company's and the Group's business operations. Our responsibilities with regards to the going concern assumption used by the board of directors are described below.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISA's, we exercise professional judgment and we maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also perform the following tasks:\n\n- \u00b7 identification and assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, the planning and execution of audit procedures to respond to these risks and obtain audit evidence which is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than when such misstatements result from errors, since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtaining insight in the system of internal controls that are relevant for the audit and with the objective to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the selected and applied accounting policies, and evaluating the reasonability of the accounting estimates and\n\nrelated disclosures made by the Board of Directors as well as the underlying information given by the Board of Directors;\n\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether or not a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's or Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going-concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and evaluating whether the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect a true and fair view of the underlying transactions and events.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee within the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the audits of the subsidiaries. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities.\n\nWe provide the Audit Committee within the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

In making those risk assessments, we considered internal control relevant to Solvay's preparation of the Reasonable assurance indicators.\n\nOur procedures included amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Performing walkthroughs of the reporting processes at the group level and on site level based on our scoping;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria in terms of its relevance, completeness, reliability, impartiality and clarity;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the consistent application of the Criteria;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing relevant staff at the local level responsible for reporting of the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing management and relevant staff at the corporate level responsible for consolidating and carrying out internal control procedures on the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing relevant staff responsible for reporting the Subject Matter in the Report;\n- \u00b7 Determining the nature and extent of the audit procedures for the locations contributing to the Subject Matter. Based on the site scoping, 15 sites were visited to evaluate the design and implementation of data reporting processes related to the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 In respect of the audit of the data, performing tests of details on the Subject Matter using internal and external documentation, and reconciling the Subject Matter with the underlying records;\n- \u00b7 Performing an overall analytical review of the data and trends in the Subject Matter at consolidated level as well as on site level;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation of the Subject Matter in the Report.\n\nWe also performed other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.",

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000'), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\nA limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the suitability of Solvay's use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Limited assurance indicators, assessing the risks of material misstatement whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Limited assurance indicators.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matter and related information, and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures. A higher level of assurance, i.e. reasonable assurance, would have required more extensive procedures.\n\nOur procedures included amongst other:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria in terms of its relevance, completeness, reliability, impartiality and clarity;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the consistent application of the Criteria;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing relevant staff at local level responsible for reporting of the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing management and relevant staff at the corporate level responsible for consolidating and carrying out internal control procedures on the Subject Matter;\n- \u00b7 Interviewing relevant staff responsible for reporting the Subject Matter in the Report;\n- \u00b7 Performing an overall analytical review of the data and trends in the Subject Matter at consolidated level as well as on site level;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation of the Subject Matter in the Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.",

These payments are discretionary and are driven by the objective of value creation. These voluntary contributions are excluded from free cash flow as they are deleveraging in nature as a reimbursement of debt.\n\n## Adjustments\n\nEach of these adjustments made to the IFRS results is considered to be significant in nature and/or value. Excluding these items from the profit metrics provides readers with relevant additional information on the Group's underlying performance over time because it is consistent with how the business' performance is reported to the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. These adjustments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Results from portfolio management and major restructurings;\n- \u00b7 Results from legacy remediation and major litigations;\n- \u00b7 Amortization of intangible assets resulting from Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) and inventory step-up in gross margin;\n- \u00b7 Net financial results related to changes in discount rates, coupons of hybrid bonds deducted from equity under IFRS and debt management impacts (mainly including gains/(losses) related to the early repayment of debt;\n- \u00b7 Adjustments of equity earnings for impairment gains or losses and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on debt;\n- \u00b7 Results from equity instruments measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 Gains and losses, related to the management of the CO 2 hedges not accounted for as Cash Flow Hedge, deferred in adjustments until the maturity of the economic hedge;\n- \u00b7 Tax effects related to the items listed above and tax expense or income of prior years;\n- \u00b7 All adjustments listed above apply to both continuing and discontinuing operations, and include the impacts on non-controlling interests.\n\n## Basic earnings per share\n\nNet income (Solvay's share) divided by the weighted average number of shares, after deducting own shares purchased to cover stock option programs.\n\n## Capital expenditure (capex)\n\nCash paid for the acquisition of tangible and intangible assets presented in cash flows from investing activities, and cash paid on the lease liabilities (excluding interests paid), presented in cash flows from financing activities. This indicator is used to manage capital employed in the Group.\n\n## Cash conversion\n\nIs a ratio used to measure the conversion of EBITDA into cash. It is defined as (Underlying EBITDA + Capex from continuing operations) / Underlying EBITDA.\n\n## CARECHEM\n\nCarechem 24 is a multilingual telephone advice service providing access to a team of trained responders 24/uni00A0hours a day, 365/uni00A0days a year. Carechem 24/uni00A0provides companies all over the world with emergency product support during a hazardous materials incident.\n\n## CFROI\n\nCash Flow Return On Investment measures the cash returns of Solvay's business activities. Movements in CFROI levels are relevant indicators for showing whether economic value is being added, though it is accepted that this measure cannot be benchmarked or compared with industry peers. The/uni00A0definition uses a reasonable estimate (management estimate) of the replacement cost of assets and avoids accounting distortions, e.g. for impairments.
