One of our key successes in weathering the storm has been our ability to offset the impact of raw material and freight cost infl ation with strong pricing initiatives, with cumulative price increases of 23% over the last two years.\n\nDespite the complex market conditions, we achieved volume growth in Latin America and South Asia, as well as in our Marine and Protective, Vehicle Refi nishes and Aerospace businesses. Meanwhile, we continued to work on our operational effi ciency and effectiveness. We introduced cost and working capital reduction measures in mid-2022, which will remain a priority throughout 2023.\n\nWe also seized opportunities to grow through acquisitions. In April, we welcomed Colombia-based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis, a strong business which will help to cement our market position in Latin America. Another deal we fi nalized (in December) was for the liquid wheel coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH, which perfectly complements our powder coatings portfolio. Finally, we announced our intention to acquire all the African paints and coatings activities of Kansai Paint (due to be completed in 2023, pending the relevant approvals).\n\nSince joining the company, I've been particularly impressed with the passion and commitment of our people when it comes to sustainability and innovation.

Adjusted operating income at \u20ac789 million (2021: \u20ac1,092 million); ROS at 7.3% (2021: 11.4%).\n\n## Business results\n\nDecorative Paints revenue was up 10% and 8% higher in constant currencies, with signifi cant pricing initiatives partly offset by lower volumes, mainly due to destocking in the distribution channels in Europe and softer market demand in China due to the impact from COVID-19. Pricing was up 12%, acquisitions added 5%.\n\nOperating income of \u20ac392 million (2021: \u20ac622 million), as pricing initiatives were more than offset by the combined impact from lower volumes, continued raw material and freight costs infl ation and higher operating expenses.\n\nOperating income included \u20ac5 million negative Identifi ed items, mainly related to restructuring costs (2021: \u20ac42 million positive, mainly related to one-off gains from the Brazil ICMS case and UK pensions curtailment, partly offset by restructuring costs).

A provisional purchase price allocation is included in the fi gures and will be fi nalized in Q1 2023.\n\nGrupo Orbis results as from the acquisition date are included in the Decorative Paints Latin America business unit, and under Other in Performance Coatings. The allocation of revenues to the Decorative Paints and Performance Coatings segments is based on the nature and products of the underlying activities. Further allocation of revenues to business unit level within the Performance Coatings segment will be available as from Q1 2023.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the acquisition of the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH was completed. Lankwitzer results as from the acquisition date are included in the Powder Coatings business unit in Performance Coatings.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the intention to acquire Kansai Paints' activities in Africa was announced, with an enterprise value of approximately \u20ac0.5 billion.

Excluding Identified items, the effective tax rate was 32.5% (2021: 24.9%).\n\nThe high effective tax rate in 2022 is mainly related to a \u20ac13 million true-up of the tax charge related to the UK ACT case (booked as Identified item), non-deductible charges resulting from hyperinflation accounting and the impact from the UK tax rate change.\n\nThe low effective tax rate in 2021 was mainly related to the impact from the Brazil ICMS and UK ACT cases, in combination with a net re-recognition of deferred tax assets (all booked as Identified items).\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity amounted to \u20ac4.3 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac5.4 billion at year-end 2021. Main movements relate to profit for the period of \u20ac352 million, offset by movements from share buybacks of \u20ac660 million (including taxes), dividend of \u20ac347 million, actuarial losses of \u20ac289 million (including taxes) and currency effects of \u20ac163 million negative (including taxes).\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy remains unchanged and is to pay a stable to rising dividend. The final 2021 dividend of \u20ac1.54 per common share was approved by the AGM in April 2022 and was paid. The total 2021 dividend amounted to \u20ac1.98 per share (2020: \u20ac1.95).\n\nIn 2022, an interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 per share (2021: \u20ac0.44) was paid. A final 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.54 (2021: \u20ac1.54) per share is proposed.\n\n## Outstanding share capital\n\nThe outstanding share capital was 174.4 million common shares at the end of December 2022. This included 3.9 million shares acquired in the share buyback programs not yet cancelled.\n\nThe weighted average number of shares for the full-year 2022 was 174.7 million shares. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares bought back and not yet cancelled and is the basis for the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nIn February 2021, a \u20ac1 billion share buyback program was announced, which was completed in January 2022.\n\nIn February 2022, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced, which was completed in December 2022.\n\n## Cash flow and net debt\n\nNet cash from operating activities decreased to an inflow of \u20ac263 million (2021: inflow of \u20ac605 million), mainly driven by lower profit for the period. Net cash from investing activities resulted in an outflow of \u20ac1,095 million (2021: outflow of \u20ac134 million). The increase in outflow mainly relates to a higher outflow for acquisitions (mainly related to the Grupo Orbis acquisition) and the 2022 net outflow from investments in short-term investments (2021: net inflow).\n\nNet cash from financing activities resulted in an inflow of \u20ac1,141 million (2021: outflow of \u20ac974 million). The change from outflow to inflow is mainly related to the inflow in 2022 of \u20ac2,189 million from changes from borrowings (including the dual-tranche bond of \u20ac1.2 billion in Q1 2022), and the lower outflow from the share buyback.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, net debt was \u20ac4,089 million versus \u20ac2,340 million at year-end 2021, mainly due to the share buyback programs (\u20ac669 million), acquisitions (\u20ac661 million), dividend",

This increase was mainly caused by higher intangible and tangible fixed assets (included in non-current assets; largely resulting from the Grupo Orbis acquisition), higher operating working capital (trade) and FX impact.\n\n## Operating working capital\n\nOperating working capital was \u20ac1.8 billion at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: \u20ac1.2 billion). This increase in operating working capital was mainly due to increased raw material prices, higher pricing and currency impact. Payables decreased, mainly as a result of destocking initiatives in the second half of the year.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe net balance sheet position (according to IAS19) of the pension plans at December 31, 2022, was a surplus of \u20ac0.7 billion (December 31, 2021: surplus of \u20ac1.1 billion). The development during 2022 was mainly the result of the net effect in key countries from higher discount rates, lower plan asset returns and higher other results, including FX.\n\n## Sustainability progress\n\nGuided by our People. Planet. Paint. approach, we've identified three key global topics - climate change, circularity and health and well-being. During 2022, we made further progress towards our 2030 key sustainability ambitions. This progress is highlighted in charts throughout this section and further detailed in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Employees\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the number of people employed was 35,200 (December 31, 2021: 32,800).\n\nEarly in 2022, we announced plans to invest in the expansion of in-house resin manufacturing. The scale-up program will help build resilience against supply disruptions while making an important contribution to achieving our financial and Scope 3 (upstream) carbon reduction ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact from the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia\n\nOur business in Ukraine and Russia combined represents about 2% of our revenue (2021: 2%), of which the vast majority concerns Russia.\n\nFollowing the EU sanctions, the majority of our Performance Coatings activities in Russia was suspended and the residual Russian business is locally operated. AkzoNobel has assessed the potential accounting impact from the localization of the Russian business. Taking into account the applicable IFRS standards, we've concluded that our Russian business can still be included in our scope of consolidation.\n\nNo significant impairments of assets occurred in Russia; in Ukraine, the value of the assets is immaterial.\n\n## Impact from hyperinflation accounting (T\u00fcrkiye and Argentina)\n\nWe have retrospectively applied IAS 29 hyperinflation accounting for T\u00fcrkiye as from January 1, 2022. For Argentina, hyperinflation accounting was already applicable from January 1, 2018. In addition, and in line with IAS 21, foreign currency rates at the end of the reporting period are used to translate both balance sheet and the statement of income into euros.\n\nThe impact from hyperinflation accounting is included in all IFRS-based\n\nmeasures; no Identified item treatment is applied.\n\nThe application of hyperinflation accounting and the use of end of month rates to translate the statement of income into euros resulted in a \u20ac5 million positive impact on revenues, a \u20ac46 million negative impact on operating income and a \u20ac63 million negative impact on net income for the year.\n\n## 2023 Outlook*\n\nAkzoNobel expects the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties to continue and weigh on organic volume growth. The company will focus on margin management, cost reduction, working capital normalization and de-leveraging.\n\nCost reduction programs are expected to mitigate the ongoing pressure from inflation in operating expenses for 2023. AkzoNobel expects declining raw material costs to have a favorable impact on profitability.\n\nBased on current market conditions, AkzoNobel targets to deliver \u20ac1.2 to \u20ac1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA. The company aims to lower its leverage ratio to less than 3.4 times net debt/EBITDA, including the impact of the Kansai Paint Africa acquisition, by the end of 2023 and return to around 2 times post-2023.",

As an innovation leader, we're working on a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 for the whole value chain (baseline 2018) - a commitment that's been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, we reduced Scope 3 emissions 6% (baseline 2018).\n\nThe size and the scale of this challenge requires the transformation of our generation. And it's this huge opportunity that's winning over our innovation eco system - of colleagues and partners - as they understand the possibilities and grasp the momentum gathering among suppliers and customers in the value chain.

'As the world moves to a more sustainable future, it's essential that vital infrastructure isn't just fi t for purpose, but is equipped for the long term as well.\n\n'That's where epoxy technology - and in particular our Interzone range -\n\nplays such a vital role as the go-to technology for this industry. It's one of the most trusted products for protecting structures operating in the harshest environments and has more than 30 years of proven performance, while also protecting over 4,000 offshore wind assets worldwide.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

High energy costs and labor shortages continued to impact our customers, while\n\npresenting us with opportunities to support our customers' sustainability ambitions. It was a mixed year for our Automotive activities, which were impacted by semi-conductor shortages, although we did see an encouraging recovery in the second half of the year. While our Consumer Electronics business was impacted by lower demand, our teams worked hard to uncover new opportunities ahead of what is expected to be another challenging year.\n\n## 2022 highlight\n\nWe introduced the vehicle refi nish industry's fi rst repair calculator to measure, manage and reduce carbon emissions. The CO 2 eRepairCalculator is designed to help customers reduce their carbon footprint when using our premium refi nish products. It identifi es the carbon levels associated with the painting and drying process - including the energy consumed - and is linked directly to the vehicle refi nishing products being used. Bodyshops are therefore able to see how changes in the products they use and the processes they follow can have a direct impact on reducing\n\ncarbon emissions and energy costs, as well as improving their productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revenue in \u20ac millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revenue by destination in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\nA\n\nEMEA\n\n43\n\nB\n\nAmericas\n\n33\n\nC\n\nAsia Pacifi c\n\n24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key brands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, our Architectural business was impacted by lower demand. We did see increased demand and uptake for our lower cure temperature solutions, due to higher energy costs. However, these cost increases - along with infl ation in general - dampened overall demand in many regions, irrespective of end markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, there were positive signs of recovery in our Automotive business in the second half of the year and we continued to invest in new innovations, including automotive applications for wheels, underbodies and EV batteries. The liquid to powder revolution has excellent growth potential, given the underlying increase in demand for more sustainable coating solutions. So we're well positioned, based on certain lower environmental impacts our powder coatings can offer.\n\n## 2022 highlight\n\nWe launched our new Futura Collection 2022-2025, which delivers a superdurable performance designed to enable buildings to stand the test of time. The legacy of a building is determined by its ability to withstand its surroundings.

Its repellent action is specifi cally designed to combat the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which was largely responsible for dengue cases in Brazil surging 180.5% by November 2022 (versus 2021), according to fi gures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health.\n\nWhen a mosquito lands on the new transparent topcoat, the permethrin is absorbed through its feet and over-excites the insect's nervous system, causing it to disengage or fall off. Permethrin is a well-known repellent and is commonly used in fabrics for mosquito nets and protective clothing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Public health is a major issue in countries across the world,' explains Daniel Campos, Director of our Decorative Paints business in Latin America. 'In Brazil, dengue is a particular problem. We wanted to help people look after their families by offering a breakthrough product which has been proven to give continuous protection against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, 24 hours a day, for up to two years.'\n\nThe effectiveness of Well-being Protection AntiMosquito was tested in an independent external laboratory, certifi ed by the Brazilian Network of Analytical Laboratories in Health. All the tests took place on painted walls and ceilings in a life-size house environment and successfully proved that mosquitoes were repelled from the room after contact, with the active ingredient being retained in the varnish matrix.\n\nThe new product is currently only available in Brazil.",

Compared with 2021, we further reduced carbon emissions by 12% in 2022 (absolute). We're well on track towards our 50% reduction target for 2030. From a relative perspective, our Scope 1 stayed flat since 2018, while our Scope 2 emissions reduced by 32%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions made up of direct emissions from processes and combustion at our facilities and indirect emissions from purchased energy.\n\n## \uf084 Energy use in 1000 TJ\n\nThe energy consumption of AkzoNobel in absolute measures and per ton of production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy\n\nPart of reducing our carbon emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) is reducing the amount of energy we consume. We're committed to reducing our relative energy consumption by 30% by 2030 (baseline 2018) and plan to do so through an ambitious 5% relative year-over-year reduction objective.\n\nFor 2022, our absolute energy consumption reduced 7% versus 2021, while our relative energy consumption was 1% up compared with 2021, and reduced by 1% versus 2018. The pie charts to the right show the breakdown for our regional energy consumption.\n\nWe track the cumulative energy reduction impact of improvement projects such as shutdown management and LED installation. This helps us better understand our performance and adjust our strategy as we continue in a cycle of continuous improvement.\n\nDespite the programs in place, achieving the 5% relative reduction target has been challenging, partly due to changes in our product and portfolio mix. For example, changes in our product portfolio mix include increased demand for products that take a higher energy intensity to produce. The current macro-economic environment has also impacted our volumes and therefore our relative energy consumption. In addition, the VOC emission abatement systems and solvent recovery units we're installing to reduce VOC emissions and waste are relatively energy intensive.\n\nWhile an overall relative energy consumption reduction of 5% was not achieved, we've implemented many energy reduction initiatives. For example, our Hull site in the UK installed CEMA lighting, which reduced the lighting system's carbon emissions by 70%. And in France, a renewal of Montataire's compressor room and a warehouse LED project have reduced annual electricity consumption by more than 1.8 GWh.\n\n| A  North America   |   18 |\n|--------------------|------|\n| B  Latin America   |   10 |\n| C  North Asia      |   16 |\n| D  South Asia      |   11 |\n| E  EMEA            |   45 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy breakdown in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| A  Electricity non-renewable   |   40 |\n|--------------------------------|------|\n| B  Electricity renewable       |   41 |\n| C  Gas                         |   15 |\n| D  Other                       |    4 |\n\nWe're continuing to investigate targeted investment for energy reduction programs, refine our energy monitoring management and implement a renewed governance structure.\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nAs shown in the graph above, electricity makes up the vast majority of our total energy use (81%). Of that, our total percentage of renewable electricity was 50% in 2022, well on track towards our target of 100% by 2030 and already achieving our 2025 interim target of 50%.",

It's only through shared responsibility that we can drive signifi cant value chain decarbonization.'\n\nGreg Poux-Guillaume, CEO\n\nAs most of our carbon footprint comes from our Scope 3 emissions, our ambitions are a key driver for innovation and collaboration with our value chain partners, especially suppliers and customers. In setting these ambitious targets, we've taken responsibility for the decarbonization of our operations and made the commitment to help our value chain partners decarbonize theirs. This is also the most challenging target, as it sits outside the scope of our direct control.\n\n## Carbon footprint in our value chain\n\nOur 50% (absolute) reduction ambition encompasses the categories below, covering around 95% of our total Scope 3 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7  Upstream: Category 1 (purchased goods and services, including packaging)\n- \u00b7  Downstream: Category 10 and 11 (application and use of sold products), VOC emissions and Category 12 (end-of-life)\n\nOur 2022 Scope 3 carbon footprint was 13.2 million tons, 9% down from 2021, driven by lower volumes and improvements in our portfolio such as more water-based solutions.\n\nWe're focused on developing increasingly more sustainable solutions and are integrating carbon reduction into our internal plans and tooling. As the development of new solutions, investments in the value chain and market acceptance takes time, we expect the majority of the reduction of our Scope 3 carbon footprint towards the latter part of the decade.\n\n## Emission reduction levers\n\nDuring 2022, we further analyzed the breakdown of our Scope 3 emissions. We identifi ed key levers for reduction which can be grouped into four categories: Energy transition; Application effi ciency; Solvent emissions; Circular solutions.\n\nWe're actively running reduction projects throughout the company in these key focus areas, and have set up a governance structure to ensure they're embedded in future plans, such as our R&D pipeline and supplier engagements.\n\n## Upstream emission management\n\nThroughout the year, we engaged with our top 200 suppliers, for example during a live webcast, to share our ambitions and encourage these key stakeholders to do the same. Key impact areas for our suppliers are: increasing process effi ciency; moving to renewable energy; and reducing the use of fossil materials and fuels. We're now working together on joint programs with key suppliers to achieve further carbon reduction in our full value chain.\n\nIn 2022, Together for Sustainability (TfS) launched the Product Carbon Footprint Guideline to ensure a consistent measure of carbon emissions along the value chain in the chemical industry and beyond. We fully support this new global guidance and encourage our suppliers to join us in using it as a way of identifying collaborative opportunities. This is in line with our ambition to move gradually from using industry averages to supplier-specifi c data. For more\n\ninformation about upstream emission management, see Sustainability and risk management with our suppliers.\n\n## Downstream emission management\n\nWe're directly engaging with our key customers to align on potential carbon reduction in their processes, for example during coating application. An example is approaching customers using gas to cure our coatings and offering them products that require lower curing temperatures - which can help lower their carbon footprint and save energy costs. With this approach, we aim to become the partner of choice for carbon conscious customers.\n\nThere's an increased demand for coatings that are less carbon intensive. In our Automotive and Specialty Coatings business, demand for ambient and UV curing coatings is rising. We're looking to collaborate with customers and advise them on carbon reduction strategies for their coating processes.\n\nThe innovation and development of our sustainable solutions not only plays a key role, but involves the majority of our approximately 3,000 people in RD&I teams and our \u20ac258 million innovation investments.\n\nWe saw a sharp increase in customer needs regarding product carbon footprint in 2022, especially in the transportation, energy and buildings segments. We're now able to provide carbon footprint data where needed and our internal teams are trained to use it in customer collaborations.\n\n## Across our value chain\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to integrate sustainability and innovation into our daily business to work towards our ambitions. For example, through our Paint the Future platform, we actively promote open innovation in areas contributing to carbon reduction (see Tackling climate change together on page 36).",

It brought together senior and next generation leaders to begin hacking four key areas: energy transition, process efficiency, solvent emissions and circular solutions. In total, 28 partners signed up to continue working on possible solutions to help limit climate change.\n\nSix months later, November's Discovery Day brought everybody back together to present what they had learned and to agree on the five projects that will continue. AkzoNobel is involved in the following three and will help:\n\n- \u00b7  The coatings industry take sustainability into account by identifying potential value proposition-based metrics that could be used to measure sustainability of products and promote sustainable choices\n- \u00b7  Raw material suppliers realize disruptive new process technologies that enable sustainable product solutions by proposing working models that share risks along the value chain\n- \u00b7  The marine coatings industry provide products to the market with minimal solvent applications by campaigning for solutions for a faster decarbonization of the value chain\n\n'Working together on this is vital,' says Wijnand Bruinsma, Director of Sustainability. 'We know the only way to achieve our target of halving our carbon emissions across the full value chain by 2030 is to collaborate with our partners - and we're thrilled to have generated so much momentum.'\n\n## Climate change adaptation and risk management\n\nAs recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we continue to monitor our risks and opportunities related to climate change.\n\nAs a company, we're exposed to physical risks - such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events - and transitional risks, such as changes in technology, market dynamics and regulation.\n\n## Carbon pricing\n\nWe have sustainability assessments in place for all material investment projects. For the last seven years, we've implemented an internal carbon price for these investment decisions, anticipating the impact of any future carbon pricing.\n\nAnnually, we quantify the potential transitional risk impact of any global carbon taxation by multiplying our carbon footprint (Scopes 1 and 2) with the internal carbon price. To analyze different potential scenarios, we calculate the impact using a carbon price ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac150 (per ton), the latter being the suggested UN price on carbon. That range results in an impact well below 1% of 2022 revenues.\n\nOur suppliers and customers might be impacted by carbon pricing, which creates both risks and opportunities. For example, we can mitigate the carbon cost impact for our customers by offering sustainable solutions (see Carbon emissions in our full value chain).\n\n## Physical risks: Natural catastrophes\n\nAs climate change will most likely increase the frequency of natural hazards, during 2022 we've further analyzed the natural hazards our operations are exposed to.\n\nAs part of our risk and insurance process, we collect information about our sites by conducting risk engineering",

The scope and frequency is based on the replacement value of the site, in a cycle of three to five years.\n\nNatural hazards taken into account during this process are: earthquakes, floods, drought, hailstorms, lightning, wind, tornados, subsidence, landslides and active volcanos.\n\nBased on these assessments, several sites are in scope with increased risk, due mainly to the potential for natural catastrophes. Based on the individual risk assessments, we put measures in place to mitigate the risks to an acceptable level.\n\nWe're currently studying what additional temperature changes (climate scenarios)\n\nwould mean for our current risk profile. As indicated in Summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, we assess the carrying value of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable as a result of risks, including environmental and climate change. With regards to the risks related to water, we use the Aqueduct water risk atlas developed by the World Resources Institute to assess the level of risk at our production locations - an exercise run every three years (see Report 2021).

To get there, we're focused on reducing the amount of waste and increasing the circular use of materials.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved circular use of materials for 56% of our obsolete material and waste streams. In line with our strategy of reducing, reusing and recycling materials, our material optimization process focuses on diverting slow-moving and obsolete materials from incineration to internal reuse and third-party recyclers and outlets.\n\nWe drive waste reduction through multi-disciplinary collaboration between our commercial teams, supply chain, manufacturing, HSE&S and our innovation teams. One objective for all manufacturing sites was to identify waste reduction initiatives. This resulted in the registration of 153 projects making progress on our KPIs. With a combined waste avoidance of about 9,000 tons, our total waste would otherwise be 15% (absolute) higher.\n\nOur relative waste (kg per ton of material produced) reduced by 5% overall, meeting our annual internal goal of 5%.

We care about the safety of our colleagues and everyone we work with. It's our vision to achieve zero injuries and harm through operational excellence.\n\nManagement programs in the areas of people safety and health, process safety and security help us live up to the highest standards in our activities and at our sites. Our commitment to running our operations safely is underpinned by our Life-Saving Rules and Golden Principle to stop work if conditions or behavior are unsafe.\n\n## People safety and health\n\nIn 2022, we accelerated our lifecritical procedures and Health, Safety, Environment & Security (HSE&S) roadmap program. We identified areas that need improvement in our own operations and put them on the roadmap with targeted plans and governance. We also continued to invest in functional excellence and the development of our capability in root cause analysis.\n\nOur lift truck/pedestrian segregation program was successfully launched, taking a risk-based approach to prioritize the highest risk areas. We also continued with Behavior Based Safety (BBS), focusing on increased quality through more coached observations.\n\nWe relaunched industrial hygiene and ergonomic programs and continued to actively manage occupational illness-related absenteeism. A stricter implementation of our two-wheeler driving policy though our 2022 safe driving program also reduced the\n\nnumber of two-wheelers used for business purposes and ensured drivers are qualified. Wellness Checkpoint continues to support the evaluation of psycho-social risk factors. Our approach to industrial hygiene and occupational health is backed up by a companywide, digitally-supported compliance assurance process.\n\nWe launched our Mental Well-being campaign in 2022 - which resulted in more than 2,500 people participating in global training and awareness sessions - and offered more support programs in local languages.\n\nBecause we care about the safety of our colleagues and everyone we deal with, we're all empowered to stop work for safety reasons - it's the Golden Principle underpinning our Life-Saving Rules.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the total reportable rate (TRR) for employees and temporary workers was again low at 0.24 (2021: 0.21), versus an ambition level of 0.20.

They are divided into categories, dependent on severity, from small, on-site spills up to Level 1.\n\n## Safety Day 2022\n\nOur annual Safety Day is the moment for us to celebrate safety and reflect on how we're doing. This year's theme was 'Learning today makes us safer tomorrow', building on our human performance principles of 'Be Human Be Safe'. By sharing our successes and near misses, we're collectively learning and improving.\n\nDuring 2022, our Ansan site in South Korea celebrated 3,000 injury-free days on World Day for Safety and Health at Work. Pictured here is the site celebrating Safety Day 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, a colleague in Popesti, Romania, sustained a life-changing injury, a partial amputation of their left index finger. A full investigation has been carried out and the learnings shared globally. There were no further lifechanging injuries or fatalities in 2022. During 2022, the number of contractor accidents was 10 (2021: 6).\n\nCOVID-19 management has remained a focus throughout 2022. Most global areas are now returning to normality, with ongoing symptom checks and suitable quarantines thereafter. All AkzoNobel locations follow the guidance from local authorities.\n\nParts of Asia, China in particular, have been subject to further lockdowns during the year. Careful local management has ensured employees have been suitably protected and operations maintained. Special care was given to overall wellbeing during these periods.\n\n## Process safety\n\nWe systematically assess, manage and communicate the operational risks of injuries or harm that may result from the work we do.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we continued our dedicated Process Safety Management (PSM) improvement project, designed to strengthen our processes and achieve leading standards in process safety.\n\nTo ensure our people, sites and environments stay as safe as possible, we introduced our Process Safety Fundamentals training plan for front-line workers. In 2022, more than 10,000 people were trained to identify and manage hazards and the program rollout will continue in 2023.\n\nDuring 2022, we also continued the deployment of our Basis of Safety standards, with a focus on resins, aluminum bonding and high-speed dispersers. The standards define company expectations for these higherrisk activities. Various engineering standards have been adopted: for grounding and bonding; flexible hose management; and maintenance of solvent storage tanks. Our locations have now completed gap assessments and equipment modifications are under way.",

The new museum is regarded as a prime example of how wood can be used for architectural purposes and not just for decorative applications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith 53 losses of primary containment (LoPCs) this year, we have improved since last year (2021: 72). The causes identified by our incident investigations mainly attributed the number of spills to operational discipline (69%) and asset integrity (28%). In total, 75% of our manufacturing locations did not have any LoPCs (up from 69% in 2021), demonstrating our vision of zero spills is achievable. However, 12% of our locations caused 72% of the spills in 2022. We continue to focus on those locations, ensuring improvement plans act on the underlying root causes.\n\n## Security\n\nOur security program protects people, information, assets and critical business processes, both on and off-site. During 2022, zero Level 3 (most severe events) incidents occurred,\n\nfewer than the previous year (2021: 4).

The management system consists of policies, procedures, templates and best practices to promote learning across the organization.\n\nHSE&S audits are performed in three-year (for high hazard sites) to five-year (other sites) cycles. During 2022, we con ducted 33 audits in total, 51% of them remotely and 6% in a hybrid format.\n\nCompliance assurance is a key HSE&S priority because it ensures our license to operate and business continuity in a fast-changing regulatory environment.

Our three priorities are:\n\n- \u00b7  Fostering an inclusive culture\n- \u00b7  Building and expanding our internal diversity and inclusion networks\n- \u00b7  Strengthening our leadership diversity with a focus on gender balance\n\nWe're building on this strong foundation to ensure our people can be and perform at their best. To further support diversity and inclusion (D&I) at AkzoNobel, we're rolling out a network of D&I Agents - who've been trained to facilitate D&I workshops - and our D&I Ambassadors Plus, who'll help connect employees on the ground with central efforts. Overall, we have almost 300 Culture and Change agents around the world and 13 D&I agents equipped to give workshops on diversity and inclusion. Almost 700 employees\n\nTrue Colors LGBTI+\n\nsigned up to become D&I Ambassadors, committed to modeling inclusive and respectful behavior. Around 90% of employees have already completed online inclusive behavior training and 70% of sites have run our inclusive behavior workshop.\n\nDiversity and inclusion is a topic of growing interest across our organization and has strong leadership support through the D&I Sounding Board comprised of Executive Committee members, senior executives and the global D&I advisor. In 2022, our inclusive language guide was completed. The year also saw the launch of our Vibe network, a community that celebrates the cultural and racial diversity of our workforce. Existing networks continued to grow and have an impact: the True Colors network (LGBTI+) has improved on our standing in the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark by almost five points; the Equal Access Board is supporting employees with disabilities by providing the resources they need to perform at their best; and our Women Inspired Network hosted an array of global and regional events.\n\nWe're proud to say we've made progress towards our goal of having 30% female executives by 2025.

Wijnand Bruinsma (Director of Sustainability), Jan Paul van der Velde (Chief Procurement Offi cer) and Petra Lehmann (Global Procurement Sustainability Manager) kicked off the discussion about working together to fi nd solutions that contribute to our ambition of halving our carbon emissions.\n\nclose to a 100% participation rate by 2025 (currently at 77%).\n\nDespite the challenging geopolitical situation and ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns, we've been able to deliver on our TfS target of conducting 25 audits in risk regions during 2022. Where needed, we requested corrective action.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Balanced Scorecard\n\nWe continue to use our Supplier Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SSBS) to collect eco-performance KPIs. In 2022, we brought our SSBS in line with our SBTi target by requesting product carbon footprint from our suppliers, in addition to waste, energy and greenhouse gas emissions information, to see if they're moving in the right direction when it comes to meeting their own sustainability goals. In 2022, we deployed the program to 50 suppliers, and over the next few years we intend to reach 100 participating companies, representing 80% of our upstream carbon emissions. We continue to work together with our suppliers to achieve our SBTi targets and will approach the remaining suppliers through the TfS carbon emission program.\n\n## Building capabilities\n\nWe're able to play a role in helping smaller suppliers understand the complexity of the sustainability agenda.",

For our buyers, we provided dedicated training on carbon footprint, which was attended by more than 100 of our productrelated buyers.\n\n## Risk in our supply chain\n\nTo better understand and manage risks around the globe from a complex supply base, we implemented 'riskmethods' in 2022. This tool helps us efficiently identify and mitigate risk in our supply chain, for example by using artificial intelligence and automated alerts to manage risks, including climate related risk.\n\n## Business Partner Code of Conduct\n\nStarted many years ago, our Business Partner Code of Conduct remains a core part of our commercial agreement with our suppliers to do business based on our core values of safety, integrity and sustainability.\n\nSuppliers with an annual spend of more than \u20ac1,000 are requested to sign our Code of Conduct as part of our onboarding procedure. This confirms their compliance with environmental, social, human rights and governance requirements. Signatories cover 99% (2021: 99%) of the product related spend and 93% (2021: 89%) of the non-product related spend.\n\n## Human rights\n\nAs part of our core values, we're committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in all our operations and throughout our value chain. We understand that through our roles as employer, manufacturer, business partner and member of many communities, we can potentially impact the lives of millions of people.\n\nWhile we're committed to making a positive impact through our products and programs, we're also aware of the potential negative impact we may cause, contribute to or be linked to. In 2021, we finalized our second in-depth global salient human rights issues assessment. While we respect all human rights equally, we prioritized certain issues based on their severity and likelihood. This has resulted in the following salient human rights issues for us to focus on. In 2022, we continued to assess and work on our human rights initiatives.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe safety of our people, those we work with and those we offer our products to is of the utmost importance. That's why we have policies and programs in place to identify and assess health and safety hazards (See Health and safety). As part of our human rights assessment, we identified two-wheeler driving as a risk area. Please refer to the People safety and health section on mitigation and implementation in 2022.\n\n## Working conditions\n\nWe take our commitment to providing good working conditions seriously, both\n\n## Salient human rights assessment\n\n|                                       | Upstream supply  chain   | Own   operations   | Logistics   | Downstream  (customers,   end users)   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Health and safety                     | l                        | l                  | l           | l                                      |\n| Working conditions                    | l                        | l                  | l           | l                                      |\n| Discrimination and harassment         |                          | l                  |             |                                        |\n| Negative impacts on local communities | l                        | l                  |             |                                        |\n| Modern slavery                        | l                        |                    | l           |                                        |\n\nfor our employees and those visiting our sites. This year, we introduced our own Global Working Hours standard in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and North Asia, and are continuing to roll them out in the remaining regions. This way we can ensure that we're working a safe number of hours everywhere in the world, even if local laws allow people to work longer. We've conducted an impact analysis in all of our regions and started making region-specific implementation plans to make sure that we don't unintentionally cause difficulties for our people and their livelihoods.\n\nIn order to safeguard and further improve access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene at our manufacturing sites, our sites annually perform a WASH selfassessment using the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's tool for business. Of the manufacturing locations assigned for 2022, 83% completed the WASH assessment. No material deviations to the requirements based on the assessments were identified in 2022.\n\n## Discrimination and harassment\n\nEveryone should be comfortable and feel they are treated with dignity and respect. We believe an inclusive environment paves the way to a high-performing organization. So we don't tolerate any sort of discrimination and we investigate allegations of discrimination and harassment.

The\n\n## Impact on local communities\n\nWe aim to be a good neighbor and con tribute to the well-being of communities. To do so, we work closely with them to manage the social impact of our business activities, address any concerns about our operations and enhance the benefits we're able to bring.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nWe have zero tolerance for modern slavery, such as child or forced labor, and conduct due diligence into our high-risk supply chains. In 2022, we sent 330 surveys to suppliers that indirectly or directly use barytes, calcium carbonate, cobalt, fluorspar, mica, talcum and tin, as those materials have a potential high impact on human rights based on our 2021 research on our raw material portfolio. We paused due diligence on copper until the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) and the Copper Mark publish their criteria guide in March 2023.\n\nFor cobalt, tin and mica, we used templates from the Responsible Minerals Initiative. Of those 104 suppliers who con firmed using tin and/or cobalt necessary for the functionality of the product, 83% disclosed their smelters. In total, 83% of these smelters were either listed as active or conformant\n\nthree winning startups were SolCold from Israel, Aerones from Latvia and the Czech Republic's SprayVision.\n\nSolCold's solution is a sustainable, self-cooling coating based on anti-Stokes. It uses the sun's energy to\n\nkeep the inside temperature much cooler, without having to use any electricity.\n\nAerones brings a robotic solution to wind turbine maintenance. Their crawling robot allows technicians to safely and efficiently perform inspections, cleaning and repairs at height.\n\nsmelters in the Res ponsible Minerals Assurance Process.\n\nAt this time, there are no conformant mica processors listed on the Responsible Mineral Initiative platform. However, through our Responsible Mica Initiative membership, we - together with many stakeholders and peer companies - commit to:\n\n- \u00b7  Having 100% of processors compliant with the RMI Global Workplace standard\n- \u00b7  Establishing a fair and responsible mica supply chain (including fair living income) in the Indian states of Jharkhand and Bihar\n- \u00b7  Eliminating unacceptable working conditions and eradicating child labor in India's mica supply chains by 2030\n\nAll our mica pigment suppliers sourcing mica in India are members of the Responsible Mica Initiative and therefore share the same commitment.\n\nFor the other materials mentioned above and that are not included in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process, we sent our own survey to 91 suppliers, over and above the 81 we surveyed last year, to increase transparency of these supply chains.\n\nSprayVision's solution brings a data-driven approach to optimizing spray application of paint, offering customers full control over the process. It helps to reduce environmental impact by saving material and improving quality.\n\n'The winning startups joined our go-tomarket acceleration program, which connected them to a global network of people and resources,' explains Menno van der Zalm, Director of the AkzoNobel Incubator. 'We've been working closely together to validate their solutions for our customers and develop a joint value case.'\n\nThe results gave us further insight into our supply chain complexity and risks. We can now set up new actions, such as planning mine audits where insufficient controls seem to be in place. By the end of the year, we had an 85% response rate on all materials (response rate on conflict mineral tin was 89%).\n\nStunning street art brightened up four neighborhoods in the Tunisian district of Jbel Jelloud, thanks to our 'Let's Colour' program and the amazing talent of 32 graffiti artists.

Given our focus on sustainability, overall ownership of sustainability is with the CEO.\n\nThe Sustainability Council advises and updates the Executive Committee on new developments, performance and the integration of sustainability into our management processes (see the Corporate governance statement).\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nWe use the principle of materiality to review our strategic priorities and assess the topics included in this integrated report. We annually determine the most material topics for our industry, based on the material topics as identified by reporting frameworks (e.g. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)) and sustainability indexes (e.g. EcoVadis and Sustainalytics). The significance for each of these material topics is determined and validated annually and reported in our annual report. More details can be found in our Reporting principles.\n\n## Reporting principles and frameworks\n\nWhen combining disclosures in this Report 2022 with disclosures on our website, we report in accordance with 2021 GRI standards, though we're still maturing our materiality process. We provide an overview of the significance of our material topics in our reporting principles, based on a desktop approach from the Sustainability Team, to align with the GRI 2021 standards. We're also in the process of further implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We provide index tables for GRI, SASB and TCFD on our website.\n\nWhile we work towards improving the maturity of our non-financial information, a selection of key KPIs is subject to limited assurance. We use our internally developed reporting principles to make our reporting more precise and aligned with our business operations. We used the GRI standards to develop and update our reporting principles. The complete reporting principles can be found on our website (Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2022: https://www.akzonobel.com/ en/about-us/sustainability-/reportingprinciples-) and a summary is included in the Appendix of this Report 2022. Grupo Orbis is not yet included in the sustainability metrics, except for female executives and AkzoNobel Cares.\n\nThe preparation of our Sustainability statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts, especially for the KPIs 'Sustainable solutions' and 'Scope 3 carbon footprint'. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. More details on the methodology and significant assumptions can be found in the reporting principles on our website.",

A qualifying activity must:\n\n- 1.  Contribute substantially to one or more of six environmental objectives, being:\n- \u00b7  Climate change mitigation\n- \u00b7  Climate change adaptation\n- \u00b7  Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- \u00b7  Transition to a circular economy\n- \u00b7  Pollution prevention and control\n- \u00b7  Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n- 2.  Do no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives\n- 3.  Be carried out in compliance with minimum (social) safeguards\n- 4.  Comply with technical screening criteria. The technical screening criteria specify the performance requirements for any economic activity that determine under what conditions that activity makes a substantial contribution to a given environmental objective and does not significantly harm the other objectives\n\nFor the financial year 2022, equal to the financial year 2021, two of the six objectives listed above have been further detailed out and are applicable for reporting: climate change mitigation\n\n| EU taxonomy CapEx                                                                       | Amount in \u20ac   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Additions to property, plant  and equipment from capital  expenditures and acquisitions | 387 mln       |\n| Additions to intangible assets  from capital expenditures and  acquisitions             | 568 mln       |\n| Additions to right-of-use  assets from additions and  acquisitions                      | 98 mln        |\n| Total                                                                                   | 1,053 mln     |\n\n| EU taxonomy OpEx             | Amount in \u20ac   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|\n| RD&I expenses                | 258 mln       |\n| Short-term lease costs       | 11 mln        |\n| Maintenance and repair costs | 102 mln       |\n| Total                        | 371 mln       |\n\nand climate change adaptation. Companies are required to report on the proportion of turnover (revenues), capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) that is associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities, and to what extent these activities are aligned (i.e. contributing to one or more environmental objectives).\n\nThe key performance indicators relevant under EU taxonomy are Turnover, CapEx and OpEx. For the purpose of the calculation of eligible activities, the following financial information has been derived from AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7  Turnover under EU taxonomy is equal to consolidated external revenues as reported in our Consolidated statement of income, amounting to \u20ac10,846 million\n- \u00b7  CapEx under EU taxonomy is the sum of additions in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets from both investments and acquisitions resulting from business combinations, amounting to \u20ac1,053 million. CapEx as included in the Consolidated financial statements excludes the impact from right-of-use assets, as well as the impact from acquisitions resulting from business combinations. Additions to right-of-use assets are included in the movement schedule on right-of-use assets as included in Note 13 of the Consolidated financial statements. The impact from acquisitions is included in the movement schedules on Intangibles and Property, plant and equipment as included in Note 11 and Note 12 respectively\n- \u00b7  OpEx is calculated in accordance with the EU taxonomy as direct non-capitalized costs incurred for the day-to-day servicing of assets, consisting of research and development costs, short-term leases, maintenance and repair costs and other similar costs, amounting to \u20ac371 million. This definition\n\ndiffers from OpEx as included in our Consolidated statement of income\n\nAkzoNobel's core activity, manufacturing paints and coatings, is currently not defined as an eligible activity for EU taxonomy, and hence no technical screening criteria have been developed to measure alignment to the environmental objectives. As a consequence, eligible activities are limited in 2022 and mainly related to supporting CapEx on sustainable solutions for production sites, consisting of investments in green electricity solutions, on-site waste water treatment systems and construction of production buildings and warehouses.\n\nFor the determination of eligible CapEx and OpEx, we've performed the following activities in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed AkzoNobel's activities and pre-identified potential eligible activities\n- \u00b7  Provided trainings to personnel involved in data-gathering, explaining key characteristics of the EU taxonomy guidelines and potential eligible activities\n- \u00b7  Performed a detailed analysis of the individual taxonomy-eligible economic activities in cooperation with key Finance and Sustainability personnel\n- \u00b7  Set up a multi-disciplinary team in charge of supporting and answering questions from personnel involved in data-gathering, as well as reviewing the reported data at a central level\n- \u00b7  Consulted with external experts and peers to ensure a correct and consistent interpretation of the legal requirements\n\nThe outcomes of the EU taxonomy assessment for 2022 in relation to eligibility to the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation environmental objectives resulted in no eligible Turnover and an insignificant amount for CapEx (and related OpEx) related to investments in waste water treatment systems and solar panels.

        "page_content": "2022 was an eventful and demanding year for AkzoNobel. In November, we ofGLYPH<31> cially welcomed our new CEO, Greg Poux-Guillaume, and said goodbye to Thierry Vanlancker. Thierry led the company through a period of signiGLYPH<31> cant change. He took over in 2017, when the company was under attack from shareholders due to years of underperformance, which culminated in a hostile takeover bid from a competitor.\n\nDuring Thierry's GLYPH<31> ve years as CEO, AkzoNobel was transformed. The Specialty Chemicals business was sold - with the proceeds being distributed to shareholders - and we became a focused paints and coatings company. The new AkzoNobel was organizationally simpliGLYPH<31> ed, integrated business processes were installed and employee engagement was lifted to a high level. The company focused on proGLYPH<31> tability, and margins were increased to standard industry levels through cost discipline and strong focus on pricing. On behalf of the whole Supervisory Board, I want to thank Thierry for his leadership and wish him every success for the future.\n\nW\n\ne were very pleased to welcome Greg as our new CEO. He's an experienced business leader with an impressive track record and we're conGLYPH<31> dent we found the best match for the company. In the short term, Greg and his team will focus on lifting both productivity and the competitiveness of the supply chain, and strengthening our market positions. The Supervisory Board is conGLYPH<31> dent Greg and the Executive Committee will be successful in leading the company on the next phase of its journey.\n\nAfter three years of strong progress on our GLYPH<31> nancial results, 2022 was very challenging. Markets contracted from Q2 onwards, as the end of COVID-19 restrictions in Europe impacted the do-it-yourself sector, and continued lockdowns in China caused additional pressure. The war in Ukraine also sent energy prices soaring and signiGLYPH<31> cantly reduced economic activity in our main markets. Like other companies in our industry, we'd beneGLYPH<31> ted from strong demand for decorative paints during COVID-19. However, global supply chain challenges forced us to increase stocks of raw materials, GLYPH<31> nished products and stafGLYPH<31> ng to secure\n\n## Statement of Chair of Supervisory Board\n\nstable supplies to customers. As a result of the macro-economic turmoil and sudden market down turn, major efforts were made during the second half of 2022 to adjust working capital and costs to the new realities. Unfortunately, these challenges weren't fully resolved before year-end and we couldn't avoid a signiGLYPH<31> cant negative impact on proGLYPH<31> tability.\n\nW\n\nNevertheless, our teams were able to defend AkzoNobel's market positions, while implementing the necessary price increases. The company also continued to move forward and remained focused on its strategic ambitions. Despite the global uncertainty, AkzoNobel is investing in its long-term growth potential, evidenced by two acquisitions completed during the year - Grupo Orbis in Latin America and the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH. e also signed an agreement to acquire the African paints and coatings activities of Kansai Paint (expected to be completed in 2023, pending the relevant approvals).\n\nThese acquisitions represent signiGLYPH<31> cant undertakings, especially during a period of global economic uncertainty. They'll require additional investments in the short to medium term, but will also boost AkzoNobel's leading positions, offering important long-term growth opportunities. The Supervisory Board was pleased to see the company making continued efforts to further strengthen its global activities. It was also encouraging to see progress being made in sustainability and innovation, which will be key to accelerating growth.\n\nDuring the year, as well as engaging in a thorough process to GLYPH<31> nd Thierry Vanlancker's successor, we also strengthened the Super visory Board by recruiting two new colleagues with signiGLYPH<31> cant chemicals industry insight - Ester Baiget and Hans Van Bylen. They both bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise. We also announced our intention to nominate Ben Noteboom as my successor at the AGM in April 2023.\n\nThe management team and all our employees should be proud of the results achieved in recent years. Admittedly, the last three quarters of 2022 were difGLYPH<31> cult and we\n\ncan't be fully satisGLYPH<31> ed with the GLYPH<31> nancial results. However, the Supervisory Board is convinced the right measures have been taken to prepare for 2023. I'd like to thank my Supervisory Board colleagues, the Board of Management and Executive Committee for all their efforts during a challenging year. Most importantly, I want to thank all our employees for their unwavering support and commitment.\n\nFinally, thank you to everyone for supporting me during my tenure. Having joined at a time when the company was under signiGLYPH<31> cant external pressure, I've had the privilege of working with you to create a strong, focused paints and coatings company with an exciting future. With a new CEO in place, the company is well positioned for the next stage of its journey. I'm therefore happy to step down at the 2023 AGM and hand over to Ben Noteboom, who will lead the organization with the new CEO. I'm conGLYPH<31> dent that with your support, they'll successfully take the company forward.

If Supervisory Board members are unable to attend a Supervisory Board or committee meeting, they inform the relevant Chair of their reasons. Supervisory Board members always receive the materials for each speciGLYPH<31> c meeting, allowing them to offer input and discuss any agenda items with the relevant Chair. In 2022, the Board of Management attended all regular and all additional meetings. The Executive Committee attended the majority of the meetings. Almost all plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board were preceded or succeeded by executive sessions of the Supervisory Board, with and without the CEO in attendance. The Chair had regular one-on-one calls with all Supervisory Board members to discuss individual impressions on the functioning of the Supervisory Board and items covered.\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims for all (regular) meetings to be held physically. However, during 2022, some meetings were held virtually due to COVID-19 related measures. The virtual meetings were held with video conference capabilities, enabling Supervisory Board members to perform their role appropriately.\n\n## Strategy updates\n\nDuring 2022, the Supervisory Board continued to allocate adequate time to discuss strategic activities. It received regular updates from the Executive Committee on the progress made towards the ambitions of the Grow & Deliver strategy, as well as on the underlying programs supporting the strategy. The Supervisory Board continued the discussion and advised on the strategic action items that were deGLYPH<31> ned in the two-day strategy meeting held in December 2021. These discussions included reviews of the growth plans for Decorative Paints and\n\nPerformance Coatings and deep dives on other strategic opportunities. The Supervisory Board further reviewed and advised on AkzoNobel's acquisition of the African paints and coatings activities from Kansai Paint. With a focus on longterm value creation, the Supervisory Board also reviewed and advised on the internal Focus 2 initiatives that were launched mid-year to mitigate the macro-economic uncertainty.\n\n## Russia/Ukraine\n\nRegular updates were also received regarding the situation in Ukraine and Russia and the impact on AkzoNobel and its employees. The Supervisory Board reviewed the actions taken to implement the EU sanctions, including the suspension of the majority of the coatings business in Russia, as well as the localization of the residual Russian business.\n\n## Functional updates\n\nThroughout the year, the Supervisory Board reviewed and discussed functional updates, including Finance, Integrated Supply Chain, Human Resources, Innovation, and Health, Safety, Environment and Security. The Supervisory Board received comprehensive market updates and advised on contingency plans. Additionally, the Supervisory Board reviewed the outcomes and developments of the Organization Health Index survey.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Supervisory Board views sustainability as an intrinsic value driver in the work of all businesses and functions. During 2022, the Supervisory Board continued to assess sustainability as part of strategy and targets and advised on further embedding related considerations in the decision-making. During the semi-annual progress updates on sustainability, the Supervisory Board reviewed and advised on the progress made towards the company's sustainability ambitions.

Further details are included in the Risk management chapter.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Supervisory Board continuously reviews the company's corporate governance and its compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Talent management and succession planning\n\nSuccession planning was an important topic for the Supervisory Board in 2022. With Thierry Vanlancker's second term as CEO coming to an end at the AGM in 2023, the Supervisory Board initiated a thorough internal and external search to find a successor. The search and selection process was led by the Nomination Committee, with the assistance of an independent and renowned search firm.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board nominated Greg Poux-Guillaume to be appointed as member of the Board of Management and CEO with effect from November 1, 2022, for an extended four-year term, which was approved at the EGM held on September 6, 2022. Further information can be found in the report of the Nomination Committee.\n\nDuring 2022, the Supervisory Board also nominated Maarten de Vries to be reappointed as member of the Board of Management for a second four-year\n\nterm, which was approved at the AGM held on April 22, 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also took the time to discuss its own composition and succession plan in order to ensure its continued effectiveness.

Byron Grote was initially appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board in 2014, and reappointed for a second four-year term in 2018. He has been Chair of the Audit Committee since April 2015 and Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board since October 2016. Given his extensive experience with AkzoNobel - and to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee while allowing for appropriate succession planning - the Supervisory Board nominated Byron Grote to be reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board for a third term of two years. Nils Smedegaard Andersen and Byron Grote did not take part in the deliberations and voting\n\nregarding their own reappointments. The aforementioned appointments and reappointments were approved at the AGM held on April 22, 2022.\n\nWith Nils Smedegaard Andersen stepping down after the 2023 AGM, the Supervisory Board further announced the nomination of Ben Noteboom to be appointed as member of the Supervisory Board for a four-year term as of the 2023 AGM, with the intention to subsequently elect him as Chair. A thorough search and selection process was conducted by the Nomination Committee, led by Deputy Chair Byron Grote, with the assistance of an independent and renowned search firm. Nils Smedegaard Andersen did not take part in the deliberation and decisionmaking regarding his succession.

Their appointments to the Executive Committee took effect per February 1, 2023.\n\n## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members are required to act critically and independently of one another, the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and the company's stakeholders. Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements of the Corporate Governance Code and completed the annual independence questionnaire addressing the relevant requirements for independence.\n\n## Supervisory Board evaluation\n\nTo assess its effectiveness, the Supervisory Board carried out an internal performance evaluation of itself, its individual members, its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the Chair, as well as the relationship with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The process consisted of Supervisory Board members completing a confidential questionnaire.\n\nThe Chair had one-on-one calls with all Supervisory Board members to discuss individual impressions on the functioning of the Supervisory Board and items covered in 2022. In a separate meeting without the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the evaluation questionnaires. The Supervisory Board also discussed the functioning of the Board of Management, the performance of its individual members and reflected on the improvement areas agreed during last year's evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the Supervisory Board and its committees continue to operate proficiently. The search and selection processes relating to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board succession matters were professionally organized, with positive outcomes and close\n\ninvolvement of all Supervisory Board members. Sufficient time was allocated to discuss the topics that reflected the future strategic priorities for the company. Focus items going forward included the transition to a new Chair in 2023, as well as continued attention for executive succession planning and talent management.\n\n## Financial statements and profit allocation\n\nThe Board of Management submitted the report and financial statements, including the report of the Board of Management, to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. The financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. for the financial year 2022 were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. (PwC).\n\nThe financial statements and the report were extensively discussed by the Audit Committee with the external auditors, in the presence of the CFO, and by the full Supervisory Board with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. Based on these discussions, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the 2022 financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.\\/. form an adequate basis to account for the supervision provided (see the Financial information).

The Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM adopts the financial statements as presented in this Report 2022 and, as proposed by the Board of Management, the proposed total dividend for 2022 of \u20ac1.98 (2021: \u20ac1.98), including a final dividend of \u20ac1.54 per share. An interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 (2021: \u20ac0.44) per share was paid in November 2022. This reflects the continued commitment to providing a stable to rising dividend. The dividend will be paid in cash.\n\nIn addition, it is requested that the AGM discharges the members of the Board of Management from their responsibility for the conduct of business in 2022 and the members of the Supervisory Board for their supervision in 2022.\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nAll Audit Committee members have extensive accounting and financial management expertise. Issues discussed in Audit Committee meetings were reported back to the full Supervisory Board in subsequent meetings.\n\n## External audit\n\nPwC, AkzoNobel's independent external auditor, reported in-depth to the Audit Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual audit of the financial statements, including the Consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements and related notes, as well as on the scope and outcome of the limited assurance engagement on the selected non-financial indicators, as included in the Sustainability statements, to provide limited assurance. The Audit Committee held independent meetings with the external auditor and critically reviewed and constructively challenged their audit approach, fees, risk assessment and audit plan for the year ahead.\n\nThe Audit Committee performed an annual review of the services of the\n\nexternal auditor, and at each meeting considered and assessed the status of the auditor's independence. Further details on the external auditor can be found in the Corporate governance statement.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the company's overall approach to governance, risk management and internal controls, its processes, outcomes, financial reporting and disclosures. It received regular updates from auditors and functions and was provided with comprehensive risk and internal control reports during the year, including an annual in-depth update on the Internal Control Framework. In its review, the Audit Committee considered the impact of changes to systems and processes, such as the centralization of the Accounting Operations processes in the GBS centers and the localization of the residual business in Russia. The Audit Committee also met regularly with senior executives.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control systems, the Audit Committee also received updates from functions such as Finance, Treasury, Information Management and Tax throughout the year. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the annual operating plan (including budget) and AkzoNobel's dividend proposals. During 2022, the Audit Committee received several updates on the IT security framework, including the corporate security program and the security program for the manufacturing sites. The Audit Committee received an update on sustainability reporting and advised on the company's roadmap and internal governance in anticipation of the upcoming sustainability reporting frameworks.\n\n## Integrity and compliance\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity\n\nand ensuring an effective integrity and compliance program and control framework. Part of these responsibilities are delegated to specific committees and the Integrity and Compliance team. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility and reviews the regular integrity and compliance reports.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Auditor presented all main audit findings to the Audit Committee and discussed the progress of the audit plan. During the year, the Audit Committee approved Internal Audit's plan and strategy, and also agreed on the budget and resource requirements for the function. The Audit Committee also met separately with the Internal Auditor during the year to discuss the results of the audits performed and the status of the follow-up on action plans identified. In 2022, the Audit Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function.\n\n## Results and financial statements\n\nBefore each publication of the quarterly results and the financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed the financial results. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and commented on the interim and final dividend proposals and on reports and press releases to be published. This was in addition to the work undertaken by the company's Disclosure Committee in reviewing the company's disclosure of potentially share price sensitive information. Based on these discussions, the Audit Committee advised the Supervisory Board on the publications and disclosures, as well as on proposals regarding the share buyback program and the interim and final dividends. All quarterly and annual releases of financial results were approved by the full Supervisory Board prior to publication and release.\n\nTo ensure its effectiveness and expertise, the Audit Committee was provided with regular updates on IFRS",

The external auditor, as required by auditing standards, also considers the risk of management override of controls. Nothing has come to the attention of the Audit Committee to suggest any material misstatement related to suspected or actual fraud involving management override of controls.\n\n## REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n## Management performance review\n\nThe work of the Remuneration Committee during Q1 focused on 2021 performance, individual performance reviews of Board of Management members and the Executive Committee. The Remuneration Committee also reviewed various incentive plans, the economic circumstances and the relative performance compared with top peers. Ahead of the nomination of Greg PouxGuillaume as member of the Board of Management, the Remuneration Committee assessed and made recommendations to the Supervisory\n\nBoard regarding the main elements of his management agreement.\n\n## 2021 Remuneration report\n\nThe 2021 Remuneration report was sub mitted to the AGM held on April 22, 2022, for its advisory vote. There was no majority in favor. The Remuneration Committee and the Supervisory Board took this feedback into account. The learnings are addressed in the Remuneration report of this Report 2022.\n\n## Remuneration Policy review\n\nIn 2022, the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board reviewed the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to assess whether these were still in",

AkzoNobel has a sponsored level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program and ADRs can be traded on the international OTCQX platform in the US.\n\nThe company's management and supervision are organized under Dutch law in a so-called two-tier system, comprising a Board of Management (solely composed of executive directors) and a Supervisory Board (solely composed of non-executive directors). The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management and ensures a strong external presence in the governance of the company. The two Boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their functions.\n\nOur corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') and all applicable laws and regulations, including securities laws. The Code contains principles and best practices for Dutch companies with listed shares. Deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with the Code's 'comply or explain' principle.

Where changes are made, these will be reported and explained in the annual report for the relevant year and discussed at the subsequent AGM.\n\nThe company also subscribes to the principles of the VNO-NCW Tax Governance Code. Further information on this is available on our website.

When it comes to the management of our business, it operates in the context of an Executive Committee. In 2022, the Executive Committee was comprised of the members of the Board of Management (the Chief Executive Offi cer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Offi cer (CFO)), the Chief Integrated Supply Chain Offi cer, Chief Commercial Offi cer - Performance Coatings, the\n\nGeneral Counsel and the Chief Human Resources Offi cer.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee ensures that functional, operational and commercial expertise is entrenched at the highest level of the organization. Among other responsibilities, the Board of Management defi nes the company's strategic direction. It establishes and maintains internal policies and procedures for effective risk management and control, manages the realization of the company's operational and fi nancial targets, its sustainability performance and its pursuit of long-term value creation. In fulfi lling their duties, Board of Management members are assisted by the Executive Committee and guided by the interests of the company and its affi liated enterprises, taking into consideration the relevant interests of the company's stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management takes precedence; all Executive Committee decisions require a majority of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management can decide to reserve decisions for itself. The members of the Board of Management remain accountable for all decisions made by the Executive Committee. The Board of Management is accountable for its performance to the Supervisory Board and is accountable to the shareholders of",

The Executive Committee members who are not also members of the Board of Management report to the CEO.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has regular, direct interaction with all members of the Executive Committee and all Executive Committee members attend most Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nThe CEO leads the Executive Committee in its overall management of the company. He is the main point of liaison with the Supervisory Board. The CFO is responsible for overseeing AkzoNobel's fi nances, its corporate control, investor relations and information management.\n\nThe tasks, responsibilities and procedures of the Board of Management and Executive Committee are set out in their Rules of Procedure. These rules have been approved by the Supervisory Board and are available on our website. Authority to represent the company is vested in the two members of the Board of Management, acting jointly. The Board of Management has also delegated a level of authority to corporate agents, including members of the Executive Committee. The list of authorized signatories is fi led with, and available from, the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Directors of the company's business units and the Corporate Directors in charge of the different functions report to individual Executive Committee members with specifi c responsibility for their activities and performance.\n\n## Appointment\n\nBoard of Management members are appointed and removed from offi ce by the AGM. The current Board of Management members were fi rst appointed by EGMs (Extraordinary General Meetings) held in 2022 and 2017, with the CFO having been reappointed for another four-year term at the AGM in 2022. The other members of the Executive Committee are appointed by the CEO, after consultation with the Supervisory\n\nBoard. Board of Management members are in principle appointed for a term not exceeding four years, with the possibility of reappointment.\n\nAs described later in this section, the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the right to make binding nominations for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. However, as the company subscribes to the principles of the Code in general, members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are (with the exception of those circumstances described later in this section) appointed on the basis of non-binding nominations by the Supervisory Board. In such cases, resolutions to appoint a member of the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management require a simple majority of the votes cast by shareholders.\n\nUnder certain conditions specifi ed in the Articles of Association, shareholders may also be entitled to nominate Supervisory Board or Board of Management members for appointment. Such appointments require a two-thirds majority, representing at least 50% of the outstanding share capital, in order to be adopted at an AGM (or EGM).\n\n## Diversity\n\nAkzoNobel believes in the strength of diversity and, in accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been adopted for the composition of the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The objective of the Diversity Policy is to enrich the Board of Management's perspective, improve performance, increase member value and enhance the probability of achievement of the company's goals and objectives. The Diversity Policy addresses concrete targets relating to diversity, including nationality, age, gender, education and work background.\n\nA consistent and structured approach is applied to succession planning for the Board of Management and Executive\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\n## 37.5 %\n\nFemale\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25\n\n%\n\n12.5\n\n%\n\n12.5\n\n%\n\n12.5\n\n%\n\n## Tenure in years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommittee, taking into account the implementation of the Diversity Policy. AkzoNobel currently diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and at least 30% male Board of Management members. It is believed that due to the size of the Board of Management (being only two male members), this divergence is justifi ed and has ensured the best candidates for the roles were nominated by the Supervisory Board and appointed by shareholders.\n\nFollowing the resignation of David Prinselaar, AkzoNobel had a 50/50 male/female diversity ratio at Executive Committee level in 2022. More information on our overall diversity and inclusion efforts, including our plans and initiatives to reach the gender balance targets for our Board of Management and our sub-top, can be found in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board of Management and Executive Committee promote openness and engagement through a SpeakUp! grievance mechanism and have\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 2018, Insight surveys have been conducted involving all employees, focused on our wider organizational health (see the Sustainability statements). The Executive Committee and Supervisory Board regularly discuss the results of the survey, the targets and the actions taken to achieve such targets.\n\nwhich was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was last amended in full following approval by the AGM held on April 22, 2021. The proposal to replace Operating Cash Flow with Free Cash Flow as one of the applied metrics for the short-term incentive was approved by the general meeting at the AGM held on April 22, 2022. The details of this policy can be found in the Remuneration report. The service contracts of the members of the Board of Management contain change of control provisions. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 26 of the Consolidated\n\nfinancial statements. The service contracts of the Board of Management are compliant with the Code. The main elements of these contracts are available on our website.\n\n## Operational Control Cycle\n\nThe Executive Committee holds regular meetings to discuss the implementation of the company's strategy and functional agendas. Additional meetings are held to discuss specific topics as required. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have delegated authorities to individual Executive Committee members and to certain committees and councils. To help plan for success and ensure alignment within the entire AkzoNobel organization on the strategic and operational plan, an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) process is in place across the company's global businesses and functions. IBP provides, on a monthly basis, visibility on the longterm integrated business and financial plan, which covers the product portfolio, demand and supply. It therefore ensures early attention and remedial actions, where appropriate, on any potential gaps. The monthly IBP cycle ends with the Corporate Management Business Review (CMBR), which is chaired by the CEO. The Executive Committee attends the CMBR meetings, where it reviews the consolidated long-term company perspective, including risks and opportunities, decides on escalation and possible scenarios and supervises the key performance indicators with corrective actions, if applicable.\n\n## COMMITTEES\n\n## Sustainability Council\n\nThe Executive Committee has established a Sustainability Council to advise on sustainability developments. The council monitors the integration of sustainability into management processes and oversees the company's sustainability targets and performance.

This committee aligns different functions within the organization with the aim of harmonizing and implementing upcoming legislation. The Sustainability Reporting Steering Committee reports into the Sustainability Council as an advisory body. Due to the increased importance of sustainability reporting, the topic will be embedded into the Sustainability Council in 2023.\n\nSignificant sustainability aspects material to the company are reviewed annually, with input from internal and external stakeholders. The Sustainability Council focuses on topics with the biggest impact on accelerating AkzoNobel's strategy to create shared value, building on our core values of safety, integrity and sustainability. Progress regarding sustainability objectives, development, target setting and implementation is reviewed quarterly by the Executive Committee, and semi-annually by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee takes an active role in assessing the quality and reliability of sustainable performance reporting and external auditor PwC has been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on specific indicators included in the Sustainability statements. Their report can be found in the Financial information.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance governance committees\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity and ensuring an effective Integrity and Compliance program and framework and has delegated part of the responsi bilities to specific committees.

For an understanding of the activities of the Supervisory Board over the past year, refer to the Statement of the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Report of the Supervisory Board. The responsibility of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the policies adopted by the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and to oversee the general conduct of the business of the company. In practice, this means supervising:\n\n- \u00b7  The corporate strategy\n- \u00b7  The achievement of the company's operational and financial objectives\n- \u00b7  The design and effectiveness of internal risk management and control systems\n- \u00b7  The main financial parameters, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and risk factors\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises the Board of Management and Executive Committee, while taking into account the interests of the company and its stakeholders. Major investments, acquisitions and functional initiatives are subject to Supervisory Board approval.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is governed by its Rules of Procedure (available on our website). The Rules of Procedure include the profile and charters of the Committees, which set out the tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, and its operational processes.\n\n## Composition\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Civil Code, the Supervisory Board has a balanced composition reflecting the nature and variety of the company's businesses, their international spread and expertise in fields such as finance, economics, information technology, societal, environmental and legal aspects of business, government and public administration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board maintains a skills matrix, which provides an overview of the skills and experience of the individual members. The skills matrix can be found on page 67.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been adopted for the composition of the Supervisory Board in its Rules of Procedure. The objec tive of this policy is to ensure a balanced composition, taking account of nationality, age, gender, education and work background. For 2022, there are no divergences to report. With five male and three female members, the Supervisory Board complies with the requirements pur- suant to the Dutch Gender Diversity Bill.\n\nWhen nominating and selecting new candidates for the Supervisory Board, account is taken of the Supervisory Board profile and skills matrix, the requirements of the Act on Management",

In accordance with the Code, Supervisory Board members are eligible for re-election once for a period not exceeding four years. Members may be re-elected a second time for a period of two years. This period may be extended by two years at the most. In the event of a reappointment after an eight-year period, reasons must be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Terms of appointment are based on a reappointment scheme, available on our website. In 2022, two appointments and two reappointments to the\n\nSupervisory Board were proposed to, and approved by, the AGM held on April 22, 2022.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nFollowing appointment to the Supervisory Board, new members receive a comprehensive induction tailored to their individual needs. This includes extensive briefings about all major business and functional aspects of the company and its corporate governance and compliance requirements. The induction includes meetings with the CEO, CFO, all other Executive Committee members and relevant members of senior management, as well as site visits. This enables new Supervisory Board members to quickly build up an understanding of AkzoNobel's businesses and strategy, as well as the key risks and issues the company faces. In addition, the Chair ensures the Supervisory Board is provided with regular updates, attends business unit deep dives and ensures that the Supervisory Board undertakes training, for example in the area of compliance and ethics.\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board shall not participate in the discussions and decision-making on a subject or transaction in relation to which they have a conflict of interest with the company. Decisions to enter into transactions under which Supervisory Board members have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the company, and to the relevant Supervisory Board member, require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Any such decisions will be recorded in the annual report for the relevant year, with reference to the conflict of interest and a declaration that the relevant best practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. During 2022, no transactions were reported under which a member had a conflict of interest which was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members receive a fixed annual remuneration and attendance fee, which is determined by the AGM. According to the Code, it is not possible for members to be remunerated in shares. An amendment to the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was approved at the AGM held on April 22, 2021. More information on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the Remuneration Policy of the Supervisory Board can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established three permanent committees - the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee. Information on the activities, composition and attendance of the Supervisory Board members at the meetings of the committees during the year is set out in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Each committee has a charter describing its role and responsibilities, as well as the manner in which it discharges its duties and reports to the full Supervisory Board.

Filled with Lennon-inspired graffiti, the wall is a symbol of love, peace and freedom and is regarded as a highlight of the city's tourist trail. Our Dulux brand donated 150 liters of paint for the project, with the whole wall being repainted in a single day.\n\nAkzoNobel has three classes of shares: common shares, cumulative preferred shares and priority shares. Common shares are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Common shares are also traded over-the-counter on OTCQX in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts (each American Depositary Receipt representing one-third of a common share). On December 31, 2022, a total of 174.4 million common shares and 48 priority shares had been issued. This includes shares held in treasury which cannot be voted on and which are not eligible for dividend. Shareholders owning 3% or more of the issued capital and/or voting rights must report this to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) as soon as the threshold is reached or exceeded. Relevant reporting by shareholders can be found in the 'Register of substantial holdings and gross short positions' at www.afm.nl\n\nThe majority of shares in AkzoNobel N.V. are included in a global certificate and held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Akzo Nobel N.V. also issued (physical) bearer share certificates (Bearer Certificates). A limited number of Bearer Certificates have not yet been surrendered to Akzo Nobel N.V., although holders of Bearer Certificates are entitled to a corresponding number of shares in\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V.

Cumulative preferred shares merely have a financing function, which means if necessary, and possible, they will be issued at or near the prevailing quoted price for common shares.\n\nThe AGM held on April 22, 2022, authorized the Board of Management for a period of 18 months after that date or, if earlier, until the date on which the AGM again extends the authorization - subject to approval from the Supervisory Board - to issue shares in the capital of the company free from preemptive rights, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital.

The maximum number of shares that the company will hold in its own share capital at any time shall not exceed 10% of its issued share capital.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions and control\n\nAccording to the Code, the company is required to provide an overview of its actual or potential anti-takeover measures, and to indicate in what circumstances it is expected that they may be used.

The same shall apply if one shareholder, or more shareholders acting in a concerted way, hold a substantial percentage of the issued common shares of the company without making an offer. Or if, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel, the exercise of the voting rights by one shareholder or more shareholders, acting in a concerted way, is materially in conflict with the interests of the company. In such cases, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, in accordance with their statutory responsibility, will evaluate all available options with a view to serving the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel has reserved the right to make use\n\nof its binding nomination rights for the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and of the Board of Management in such circumstances. Although a deviation from provision 4.3.3 of the Code, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are of the opinion that these provisions will enhance the continuity of the company's management and policies. In the event of a hostile takeover bid, or other action which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board consider adverse to the company's interests, the two Boards reserve the right to use all available powers (including the right to invoke a response time in accordance with provisions 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 of the Code), while taking into account the relevant interests of the company and its affiliate enterprises and stakeholders.\n\n## AUDITORS\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the AGM on proposal of the Supervisory Board.

The Audit Committee has been delegated direct responsibility for the compensation and monitoring of the auditors and the services they provide to the company. Pursuant to the Audit Profession Act, the auditors are prohibited from providing the company with services in the Netherlands other than 'audit services aimed at providing assurance concerning the information supplied by the audited client for the beneGLYPH<31> t of external users of this information and also for the beneGLYPH<31> t of the Supervisory Board as referred to in the reports mentioned.'\n\nThe company has taken the position that no additional services may be provided by the external auditor and its global network that do not meet these requirements, unless local statutory requirements so dictate. In order to anchor this in our procedures, the Supervisory Board adopted the AkzoNobel Rules on External Auditor Independence and Selection and the related AkzoNobeI Procedure on Auditor Independence. These documents are available on our website.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function is mandated to provide the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Audit Committee with independent, objective assurance on the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of the internal control framework described below. The Internal Auditor reports to the Board of Management and has direct access to the Audit Committee and its Chair. The function performs its mandate based on a risk-based audit plan, which is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee.

The Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members require authorization from the General Counsel prior to carrying\n\nout any transactions in respect of\n\nAkzoNobeI securities, even in a so-called 'open period'. In relevant cases, the General Counsel can prohibit carrying out transactions in respect of other companies' securities. In addition, all employees are subject to the AkzoNobeI Rules on Disclosure Control.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe company has adequate processes and procedures for internal controls. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have established several Risk, Control and Compliance Committees, which are explained on page 81. In 2022, we continued to invest in enhancing our Internal Control Framework and processes, including further leveraging system embedded and system enabled controls, standard role design and segregation of duties monitoring, helping us to prevent fraud and reputational damage. An integrated Risk and Internal Control department supports all businesses and functions in their work.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOur risk management system is explained in more detail in the next chapter.

Risk management is an essential element of our corporate governance and strategy development. We continuously strive to foster a high awareness of business risks and internal control to provide transparency in our processes and operations.\n\nAkzoNobel complies with the risk management requirements of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016. The Board of Management and Executive Committee are responsible for managing the risks associated with our strategic objectives and the establishment and adequate functioning of appropriate risk management and control systems (see Statement of the Board of Management).\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOur risk management framework is in line with the Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework of COSO and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. It is an embedded, company-wide activity, focused on the areas of main risk exposure and provides reasonable assurance that our business objectives can be achieved and our obligations to customers, shareholders, employees and society can be met. The process consists of risk appetite setting by the Executive Committee to serve as input for our strategy and general risk management approach, followed by structured risk assessments applying a top-down and bottom-up approach, and the management and monitoring of identifi ed risks. The risk management framework is discussed twice a year with the Supervisory Board.\n\nFor more information on our risk management framework, visit the Risk management section on our website.\n\n## Risk management in 2022\n\nAkzoNobel's risk appetite differs depending on the type of risk, ranging from a 'risk averse' to a 'risk-taking'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproach.

Risks were identifi ed by responsible management teams and functional experts, followed by the defi nition of adequate mitigating actions.

The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility. The Executive Committee has delegated certain responsibilities to the following working committees and Integrity and Compliance team:\n\n## Integrity and Compliance governance committees\n\nThe Integrity and Compliance governance committees are at the core of our Integrity and Compliance governance model. We assess the need for committees depending on organizational changes, changes in the risk profile of business units and regulatory and legislative changes. In 2022, we had committees in place in all eight business units, the Integrated Supply Chain organization and our key countries. The committees consist of business unit leadership and key\n\ncorporate function leaders, including the Integrity and Compliance managers. The committees drive the operationalization of the Integrity and Compliance program into the organization, with a strong focus on prevention. The committees discuss trends, identify and address risks and share learnings from investigations in order to drive continuous improvement. The committees meet at least on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee\n\nThis committee reviews investigations into SpeakUp! reports involving alleged violations of our Code of Conduct and applicable laws. The committee also decides on discipline and control improvement actions, as well as monitoring and responding to any trends identified in investigations. The Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee refers for decision to the Executive Committee all cases that involve senior management, that are over a specific monetary value, or otherwise, as identified by the Director of Integrity and Compliance. The centrally established Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee ensures transparency and consistency of disciplinary actions throughout the organization. In 2022, there were no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the committee that would warrant separate disclosure in the annual report. Should there be material compliance matters, or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these will be addressed through the Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (see below) and discussed with the Audit Committee and external auditor, and where appropriate disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (RCC)\n\nThe RCCs are responsible for supervising the effectiveness of the control environment and reviewing weaknesses in this environment, as well\n\nas progress on improvement actions. There are eight business unit RCCs and seven functional RCCs, in addition to a group RCC. They each met quarterly in 2022.\n\n## Human Rights Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the company's human rights framework and driving the further expansion of the human rights program. We reconfirmed, and continued to address, the issues identified during our second in-depth salient human rights issues assessment in 2021. For more information on our human rights framework and program, see the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Privacy Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the company's privacy framework and driving the further improvement of the privacy program. For more information on our key privacy activities, see the Privacy program paragraph.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance team\n\nThe Integrity and Compliance team is led by the Director of Integrity and Compliance, who reports to the General Counsel. The team includes experts in integrity and compliance program design, legal experts in the field of competition law, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, data privacy and human rights, as well as our Integrity and Compliance managers in all regions driving the implementation of the program.\n\nTo ensure the company maintains and strengthens its culture of integrity, the Integrity and Compliance team together with various other functions and stakeholders across the organization\n\n- - focuses its efforts on the following key areas:\n- \u00b7  Help leaders set a strong tone at the top and lead by example\n- \u00b7  Drive awareness and ownership of all employees through effective policy management, training and communication",

In 2022, the heads of Integrity and Compliance, Internal Control and Internal Audit met at least quarterly to discuss findings and trends, and to align actions. The Director of Integrity and Compliance also met at least quarterly with the Export Control and Sanctions team to discuss the priorities in this area and the impact of the geo-political developments.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe have redefined our risk management approach to enable the Integrity and Compliance governance committees to play a key role in integrity and compliance risk assessments moving forward. A new integrity and compliance risk assessment process will be rolled out in 2023, whereby the Integrity and Compliance governance committees will be asked to identify and prioritize key risks and define action plans and owners to mitigate these risks.\n\n## POLICY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Policy portal is our one-stop-shop for key policies, rules and procedures relating to our global processes and key topic areas. Maintenance of the portal and improvement of the userfriendliness, as well as the quality of the documents hosted on the Policy portal, is an ongoing process.\n\n## COMMUNICATION\n\nWe have reshaped our communication program by simplifying and shortening our messages to reach more colleagues and raise greater awareness. To continuously ensure a strong tone from the top, we initiated a core values update in our regular CEO webcast to highlight key integrity topics. Although no major risks or issues were identified in the SpeakUp! cases, we launched SpeakUp! Insights, a quarterly casesharing program through which we ask our leaders to discuss the learnings with their teams and encourage speaking up. Focusing on the same theme, we also introduced a monthly SpeakUp! story program, where we use a storytelling approach to share cases with the broader organization through various communication channels. In addition, a focused SpeakUp! campaign was launched to encourage employees to speak up if they see any wrongdoing around them.\n\n## TRAINING AND EDUCATION\n\nDedicated training on key integrity and compliance topics continued to be delivered on a largely remote/virtual basis, although we're slowly moving back to more face-to-face trainings. The training we offered covered various topics, including our Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, operating a diverse and respectful workplace, competition law, export control, and information security and data privacy. As part of the integration of Grupo Orbis, we conducted Code of Conduct training for all their employees, as well as specific training on key risks to targeted audiences. We also updated our mandatory compliance training curriculum and focused on improving the deployment process of mandatory training and audience selection to ensure employees are trained on topics of special relevance to them.\n\n## COMPETITION LAW PROGRAM\n\nCompliance with competition law and competing fairly remains a key topic within the company. A particular focus has been businessfacing communications relating to fair competition, aspects of pricing initiatives and risks around information exchange. Proposed strategic initiatives and commercial developments, especially in key markets, have been carefully reviewed from a competition perspective. The competition law aspects of M&A activity, and subsequent integrations, continue to be a focus area.\n\n## PRIVACY PROGRAM\n\nDigital privacy compliance remains a key topic, with special focus on privacy compliance on websites and customer consent. In 2022, a new (and partly automated) process for handling customer data subject requests was piloted.\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTICORRUPTION PROGRAM\n\nWe don't make, offer, or authorize bribes or conduct any other form of unethical business practice. We developed special training and guidance materials, as well as redesigning and piloting our gift and conflict of interest tool (including a pre-approval workflow), to strengthen controls, data gathering and data analysis.\n\n## MONITORING\n\nWe have several processes to monitor compliance with our rules and procedures by employees and business partners. Employees are informed about this through the Employee Privacy Statement. Managers are also required to self-assess and confirm compliance with company rules and procedures as part of the internal control self-",

Our supplier performance is monitored through the EcoVadis self-assessments and on-site third-party audits that we carry out via the Together for Sustainability initiative. From a competition law perspective, we also ran amnesty programs for newly acquired businesses as part of the integration process into the wider group.\n\nThe Internal Audit function performs numerous audits on our operations. Their audit plan is risk-based and takes account of prior compliance and internal control findings. Internal audits were also held or covered specific risks - at the request of the Integrity and Compliance function - to validate compliance with our rules and procedures in certain units, or on certain risk areas.\n\n## GRIEVANCE AND INVESTIGATION\n\nOur SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees and third parties a means to raise concerns relating to\n\ncompliance with our Code of Conduct and violations of applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## REPORTING\n\nDuring 2022, the Director of Integrity and Compliance reported four times to the Executive Committee and three times to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on the status of the Integrity and Compliance program, material developments and initiatives, as well as material cases. Material investigation matters, if any, are also discussed with our external auditor on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Visit the SpeakUp! website https://akzo.no/SpeakUp\n\nThere were no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee that would warrant separate disclosure in the annual report. Should there be material compliance matters or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these will be addressed through the RCCs and discussed with the Audit Committee - as well as with the external auditor - and, where appropriate, disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.\n\nOur dedicated investigation team follows an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard. The investigation program has been updated to reflect the EU Whistleblower Directive, as transposed into national laws. In 2022, the total number of reports across all channels increased slightly. This was driven by several factors, including increased communication on the SpeakUp! process, and use of the system to report concerns or general enquiries unrelated to the Code of Conduct, which are referred to the appropriate subject matter expert. All reports and alerts led to 25 dismissals and various other disciplinary measures and control improvements, confirming the value of the company's grievance framework.\n\n## SpeakUp! reports\n\n|                                                           | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total reports and alerts registered                       | 250    | 305    | 350    |\n| Reports received through SpeakUp!                         | 180    | 232    | 251    |\n| Integrity                                                 | 61     | 94     | 72     |\n| Safety                                                    | 21     | 17     | 23     |\n| Sustainability                                            | 98     | 121    | 156    |\n| Dismissals resulting from SpeakUp! reports                | 6      | 6      | 6      |\n| Conclusions to SpeakUp! reports closed in  calendar year: |        |        |        |\n| Substantiated                                             | 27     | 33     | 36     |\n| Unsubstantiated                                           | 70     | 50     | 63     |\n| Other (e.g. referred)                                     | 46     | 106    | 119    |\n\nIn 2022, 99 reports were received outside our SpeakUp! mechanism, leading to 19 dismissals.

        "page_content": "## Promoting gender equality\n\nOur ongoing efforts to promote gender equality and boost career opportunities gained extra momentum in 2022, thanks to the Women in Color (Mulheres na Cor) program we launched in Brazil.\n\nThe vocational course is dedicated to empowering women to build careers in the decorative paints and vehicle refinishes industries - which are traditionally male-dominated - and we were delighted to see 14 participants graduate as decorative painters before the end of the year.\n\nLaunched in 2021, when women were initially offered training in vehicle refinishing, the latest edition of the program built on that success and switched the focus to decorative painting. According to a survey\n\nfrom the Brazilian Association of Professional Painters, women represent only 10.5% of their members, clearly indicating that it's a market where women are still looking for greater representation.\n\nDuring the ten-week course, the women received comprehensive 360\u00ba tuition totaling more than 200 hours. The training was provided by SENAI, one of the five largest professional education organizations in the world and the largest in Latin America. An additional 30 hours of training was conducted by our own Coral Academy.\n\nOne of the graduates, J\u00falia dos Santos Silva, explained that she saw the program not just as an opportunity to learn a new profession, but a chance to obtain the necessary skills to paint\n\nand beautify her own house, without relying on anyone else. 'I want to earn my own money and I learned that it is possible to take care of the house, my children and also work,' she said.\n\nFollowing the graduation, one of the program's partners - a company that provides professional painting services for buildings - hired seven of the women. Some of the other graduates have also started work as independent professionals offering house painting services and have been included on 'Colored Pages', Coral's online portal designed to help people find a painter. In addition, Coral has launched the campaign 'Renovate with them', which aims to encourage society to hire women as painters and rethink how to support gender equality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGraduates from our Women in Color program assisted artist Mari Pavanelli when she painted a special mural onto a community center in S\u00e3o Paulo.",

        "page_content": "## Dear stakeholders\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I'm pleased to introduce our 2022 Remuneration report. We received feedback from shareholders and proxy voting agencies on the voted down Remuneration report of 2021 at the AGM in 2022, which listed specific concerns and suggestions for what AkzoNobel can improve.\n\nThe feedback we received included the following:\n\n- \u00b7  The performance on Short-Term Incentive (STI) metrics was not sufficiently detailed\n- \u00b7  More details were requested regarding the non-financial metrics in the incentive plans\n- \u00b7  For the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan, the Supervisory Board used discretionary power to evaluate performance against the ROI target of 20%, as communicated in early 2020 in context of the Grow & Deliver strategy, whereas the ROI target communicated at the start of the performance period was 25%\n\nWe've taken this feedback into account by detailing the information on Short-Term Incentives, by providing more information on the non-financial objectives and by applying no discretion in 2022. This was despite unforeseeable events, such as the war in Ukraine, which rapidly impacted the likeliness of realizing these targets.\n\n2022 presented us with a volatile business climate, with the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the geo-political consequences of the war in Ukraine, shortages and significant price increases in raw materials and freight.\n\nAfter a strong first quarter, this climate had a severe impact on the results of the company, with profit warnings in the second and third financial quarters of the year. Therefore, we could not deliver on objectives set in more auspicious times.\n\nAll components of the financial metrics of the 2022 STI for the Board of Management ended well below the 0% threshold and delivered no pay-out on the financial metrics of the plan for the CEO and CFO.\n\nIn 2022, STI compensation was limited to only the non-financial objectives, with details provided in the section on STI, keeping in mind that some of these objectives will be directional ('improve significantly'), as they address components (for example, pricing and cost actions) that can only be evaluated in the context of evolving market conditions.\n\nThe achievement on the Long-Term Incentive metrics was below threshold for both applicable metrics - TSR and ROI - and, as a result, no shares that had been conditionally granted under the 2020-2022 Long-Term Incentive plan will vest for the Board of Management.\n\nFor 2023, we have set challenging, but realistic, targets in order to strike a better balance between our commitment to stakeholders and our ability to reward and retain.\n\n## Dick Sluimers\n\nChair of the Remuneration\n\nCommittee\n\n## Amendment regarding the Board of Management Remuneration Policy, following stakeholder feedback\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on April 22, 2022, an amendment to the STI metrics in the Remuneration Policy was approved with a majority of 91.94% of the votes. The amended Policy became effective (retroactively) from January 1, 2022, and will remain effective until a new Policy is approved, which will be proposed to shareholders no later than at the 2025 AGM.\n\nIn 2021, in favor of transparency and strategy alignment, the AGM approved the adjusted OPI and operating cash flow (OCF) metrics as the two financial STI metrics that are applicable throughout the effective period of the Policy. Taking into account external (e.g. shareholder) feedback, OCF has been replaced by free cash flow (FCF) in the amended Policy that was approved at the 2022 AGM. The reason being that OCF is an internal metric which is not externally published, and focuses only on adjusted EBITDA, CapEx and working capital. Therefore, OCF is viewed as what the Board of Management can 'operationally control directly'. Feedback was also received from shareholders who favor FCF over OCF, because FCF is an externally published metric, and is therefore well recognized by investors. Ultimately, the Board of Management is expected to steer on FCF as it also includes elements such as interest, tax and cash out from provisions.\n\n## The annual report on remuneration\n\nThis report includes a summary of the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) for our Board of Management and Supervisory Board, as well as our annual report on remuneration, which sets out how our Policy was applied in 2022 - and how it will be applied in 2023.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, the Board of Management Policy and the Supervisory",

In communication between AkzoNobel, investors and other stakeholders, the main concern expressed was related to the disclosure of the financial and non-financial STI targets, as well as a discretionary decision to evaluate performance against the ROI target of 20%, as communicated in early 2020 in context of the Grow & Deliver strategy.\n\nThis Report 2022 includes improvements in transparency on the relevant STI me trics, as requested, and no discretionary power has been used to adjust performance. This document is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in 2023.\n\nVisit our website for a full description of the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\n## Remuneration for the Board of Management\n\n## Summary of the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management\n\nThe Remuneration Policy is designed to incentivize the Board of Management to achieve the company's objectives,\n\nwhile considering market competitive standards, ratio between fixed and variable pay, the perspectives of shareholders and other key stakeholders and environmental, social and governance (ESG) related contributions of the company.\n\nThe focus on pay-for-performance is achieved by including both short and long-term incentives that are aligned with the company strategy to realize longterm sustainable value creation. Variable remuneration provides an incentive to realize long-term value creation. For the short term, the Supervisory Board sets operational targets over a one-year period that are crucial to the company and are pre-conditions to value creation. The biggest portion of the remuneration packages of Board of Management members is directly aimed at strategic priorities that contribute to building sustainable long-term value creation, with targets for return on invested capital, adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth and specific ESG goals.\n\nGoal setting is crucial to drive pay for performance in alignment with the company's strategy, and to ensure that decisions made - and results delivered - are aligned with the interests of AkzoNobel's stakeholders. The Supervisory Board sets goals, their respective weight and targets (i.e. metrics) for the respective performance year under the STI and LTI scheme, considering: (1) Company strategy;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand below\n\nand below\n\n(2) Focus on long-term value creation; (3) Historical performance, business future outlook and circumstances and priorities; (4) Stakeholder expectations. Goals must be stretching yet achievable.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee conducts scenario analyses of the possible financial outcomes of meeting different performance levels (threshold and below, at target and maximum), and how it affects the structure and value of the Board of Management's total remuneration. Unintended consequences of providing incentives that are too attractive and support inappropriate risk-taking are avoided by selecting a total direct compensation pay mix at target consisting of around 25% of base salary and defining maximum opportunities and targets which closely reflect AkzoNobel's overall performance.\n\nWhen implementing the Policy, the Remuneration Committee consults external remuneration professionals to obtain appropriate benchmark data, and on other matters where it requires independent advice. The remuneration principles that apply for the Board of Management are aligned with those applied more broadly in the company. This provides a shared sense of purpose and direction at different management levels and a shared reward when success is achieved.\n\n## Labor market peer group\n\nAs an international company, AkzoNobel must remain attractive to high caliber members of the Board of Management. The reference group consists of companies of similar scale, complexity and geographic reach to AkzoNobel. Despite being a global company, only companies headquartered in Europe (consisting of AEX-listed companies and industry peers) are included to reflect local pay practices.\n\nThe labor market peer group against which remuneration levels are compared consists of the following European-only companies:",

For ANS2020, the cumulative dividend over 2020 and 2021 of 4.63% has been added to the original grant of 18,747 shares, and for ANS2021 the 2021 dividend yield of 2.58% has been added to the original grant of 26,713 shares.\n\nincentive grants will vest on a pro-rata basis, calculated over the period until the end date of the management agreement. Thierry Vanlancker is not entitled to the short-term incentive over the financial year 2023, is not entitled to participate in the share-matching related to the 2022 STI payment, and will not receive a conditional share grant in 2023. In compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the management agreement, the severance payment upon termination of the management agreement will not exceed one annual base salary.\n\nBased on performance against the financial and non-financial targets as further described in this Remuneration report, Thierry Vanlancker receives a short-term incentive payment of \u20ac469,260 (39.81% of salary).\n\nThe existing LTI grants (2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 LTI plans) will vest time pro-rated at the regular vesting dates, subject to achieved performance at the end of the respective performance period. Shares that may vest under these plans will be subject to the holding period of two years. In 2020, 18,747 shares were granted conditionally. After applying the final vesting percentage of 0%, the entire 2020 conditional grant has been forfeited. The 26,713 shares that were conditionally granted in 2021 and the 25,578 shares conditionally granted in 2022 will be pro-rated, calculated over the period until the end date of the\n\nmanagement agreement, to respectively 20,777 (28/36 of 26,713) and 11,368 (16/36 of 25,578) conditional shares. After vesting, an additional two-year holding period applies.\n\nThe 2,708 potential matching shares will be pro-rated as well, resulting in 903 potential matching shares. These shares will be matched upon termination of the management agreement in April 2023.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe base salary of the CEO, Greg PouxGuillaume, was presented at the EGM on September 6, 2022, and effective from his start date in the company on October 1, 2022. The 2022 base salary for the CFO, Maarten de Vries, was presented at the AGM on April 22, 2022, and made retroactively effective from January 1, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  Greg Poux-Guillaume, CEO: \u20ac1,225,000\n- \u00b7  Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac727,750\n\n## Short-Term Incentives (STI)\n\nIn 2022, the financial objectives of the short-term incentives were adjusted operating income (OPI) and free cash flow (FCF). The non-financial objectives encompassed initiatives central to the company's transformation plan, such as price and working capital management.\n\nThey also anticipated a CEO transition later in the year, for which a smooth handover is essential to maintaining AkzoNobel's momentum. Although the\n\npersonal objectives are directional in nature, a number of these objectives for 2022 are quantified and therefore allowed for an objective evaluation of progress achieved towards targets, which resulted in a weighted performance score of 132.7%:\n\n- \u00b7  The Board of Management had the objective to focus on margin management by keeping pricing ahead of raw material and logistics cost inflation. In 2022, the company managed to offset raw material and freight increases through price increases and margin expansion of \u20ac186 million (target: \u20ac100 million), with actual performance on pricing strategy ending up at 143%\n- \u00b7  The Board of Management executed disciplined cost control and reduced inventories. In the second half of 2022, the additional reduction in operating expenses amounted to \u20ac31 million (target: \u20ac25 million). Reduction of inventories amounted to \u20ac263 million (target: \u20ac200 million), resulting in an actual performance of 122%\n- \u00b7  In 2022, gender targets were set for all businesses and functions to increase female representation as part of leadership accountability, with the goal of having 30% female executives by 2025. In 2022, the company landed above its annual target of 25% with 26% female executives. A global engagement survey among employees was conducted, similar to previous years. In 2022, the overall OHI score was 72 (target: 72), with",

Finally, the Supervisory Board wanted to ensure a proper and complete handover of responsibilities to the new CEO. On November 1, the Supervisory Board concluded that the handover was completed successfully and that the Board of Management had put in significant effort to ensure a proper induction of the new CEO. This brings the overall weighted performance on the organizational health objectives to 133%\n\nIn determining the outcome of the STI elements, the Remuneration Committee applied a reasonableness test in which the actual level of the performance was critically assessed in light of the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. The 132.7% achieved on personal objectives by the Board\n\nof Management contrasts with the 0% payout on financial objectives, a discrepancy which could leave the impression of excessively lenient personal targets, but the Supervisory Board does not believe this is the case here.\n\nIt's important to note that all targets for 2022 were finalized a few weeks before the start of the war in Ukraine, which severely impacted the wider economy and Europe in particular. Even though the assumptions made at the beginning of 2022 did not foresee the drastic macro-economic developments which impacted the performance of the company, the Supervisory Board took the feedback received from shareholders, and the commitment made following shareholder outreach to not make changes after the fact, to heart. As such, it neither adjusted the targets nor did it apply discretion\n\nto the evaluation of those targets. While this had a limited impact on personal objectives - which are largely independent of the economic context and measure performance on a given metric versus that metric's baseline - it had a drastic effect on financial objectives, which are measured against a performance baseline extremely sensitive to the macro-economic context. In other words, while there was strong realization of personal targets which had a positive impact on the financial performance, that impact was diminished by the deterioration of the economic environment very early in the year, which rendered our budget obsolete, but for which we did not adjust our evaluation of performance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board recognizes the efforts made by the Board of Management to counter the difficulties",

Despite the below threshold performance on the financial objectives, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the Board of Management is deserving of its 132.7% payout on its personal objectives which, for context given the zero pay-out on financial objectives, results in a total STI 2022 pay-out of slightly below 40% of target.\n\nAs included in the summary of the main elements of the management contract of Greg Poux-Guillaume, which was published upon his nomination for appointment at the EGM on September 6, 2022, Greg Poux-Guillaume is entitled to an at target, pro-rated bonus pay-out for the performance year 2022.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sub sequently determined that bonus payments for the Board of Management would be:\n\n- \u00b7  Thierry Vanlancker, former CEO \u20ac469,260 (39.81% of salary)\n- \u00b7  Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac231,788 (31.85% of salary)\n- \u00b7  Greg Poux-Guillaume, CEO: \u20ac306,250 (100% of salary)\n\n## Share-Matching Plan\n\nThe Share-Matching Plan reiterates the importance of share ownership, which\n\nunderpins alignment over the long term. In addition to the required investment of 25% of STI proceeds (net after tax and other deductions), both the CEO and the CFO decided to invest another 25% totaling the maximum investment of 50% of total net STI proceeds for 2022.\n\nThe Share-Matching Plan was suspended for STI payments made in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. For this reason, no matching shares have been received by Board of Management members in 2022.\n\n## Long-Term Incentives (LTI)\n\nConditional grant LTI share plan 2022-2024\n\nThe Remuneration Committee determines the grant levels to be made in respect of members of the Board of Management, within the limits and plans that have been approved by shareholders. In 2022, Greg PouxGuillaume received a conditional grant of shares equivalent to 27/36 th of the face value of 200% of his annual base salary (pro-rated) as approved by the EGM, while Maarten de Vries received a conditional grant of shares equivalent to the face value of 150% of his annual base salary. The grant price was determined based on the average share price of an AkzoNobel common share in the two weeks following publication of the annual results on February 22, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  19,936 shares were conditionally granted to Greg Poux-Guillaume, CEO\n- \u00b7  11,844 shares were conditionally granted to Maarten de Vries, CFO\n\nVesting of the conditional grant is linked to four performance metrics shown (see the first table on the left).\n\nRevenue growth as weighted average is compared with a defined industry peer group, consisting of the following companies in the paints and coatings sector: Sherwin-Williams, Nippon Paint, PPG, Axalta and BASF Coatings. Organic growth rates to calculate the performance take into consideration price, mix, volume growth and exclude the effects of exchange rates and mergers and acquisitions. For Axalta and Sherwin-Williams, only organic growth percentage of the Performance Coatings business growth is taken into consideration.\n\nThe ESG targets consist of four equally weighted targets related to our approach to sustainability (see the second table on the left).\n\nIn the course of 2022, the Supervisory Board determined for each target: (i) the performance level below which no shares vest; (ii) the performance level at which the target number of shares vest; and (iii) the performance level at which the maximum number of shares vest.\n\n## Vesting of the LTI share plan 2020-2022\n\nUnder the LTI share plan 2020-2022, a conditional grant of 12,616 shares was made to the CFO. As the CEO joined AkzoNobel on October 1, 2022, no conditional grant was made in 2020 to the CEO under this LTI share plan.\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy, vesting of 50% of the shares conditionally granted in 2020 was linked to AkzoNobel's ROI performance, which was reviewed at the end of the performance period by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board set the threshold for ROI, excluding unallocated cost,",

For ANS2020, the cumulative dividend over 2020 and 2021 of 4.63% applies, and for ANS2021, the 2021 dividend yield of 2.58% applies.\n\nat 17% and the maximum at 25%. As ROI performance was below threshold in 2022, the corresponding vesting percentage for this specific part of the long-term incentive is 0%.\n\nThe other 50% of the conditional grant was linked to AkzoNobel's relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance compared with the companies in the following defined industry peer group:\n\n- \u00b7 Asian Paints\n- \u00b7 PPG\n- \u00b7 Axalta\n- \u00b7 Masco Corp\n- \u00b7 Nippon Paint\n- \u00b7 Sherwin-Williams\n- \u00b7 Tikkurilla\n- \u00b7 Kansai Paint\n\nIn line with last year, following the acquisition of Tikkurilla by PPG, the Remuneration Committee decided to freeze Tikkurilla's share price at \u20ac14.23. This share price was calculated as the average closing share price in the four weeks before the acquisition was publicly announced. Independent external experts conducted an analysis to calculate the number of shares that would vest according to the TSR ranking. In order to adjust for changes in exchange rates, all local currencies were converted into euros.\n\nAkzoNobel's TSR performance during the period 2020 to 2022 resulted in the eighth position within the ranking of the peer group companies. This ranking\n\n- \u00b7 RPM International\n\nresulted in a vesting of 0% for this part of the long-term incentive, as shown in the table below.\n\n## Relative TSR vesting scheme for the conditional grants\n\n| Rank   |   Vesting (as % of 50%  of conditional grant) |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1      |                                           150 |\n| 2      |                                           135 |\n| 3      |                                           120 |\n| 4      |                                           100 |\n| 5      |                                            75 |\n| 6      |                                            50 |\n| 7      |                                            25 |\n| 8-10   |                                             0 |\n\nBased on the company's combined ROI and TSR performance, the final vesting percentage of the 2020 conditional grant is zero. The Remuneration Committee determined that based on this performance, no shares would vest for Thierry Vanlancker and Maarten de Vries.\n\n## Overview - number of performance-related shares\n\nAn overview of shares awarded, or due to, Board of Management members is shown above.\n\n## Claw back, value adjustment and loans\n\nIn 2022, there was no cause for a claw back or value adjustment by the Remuneration Committee. The company does not grant loans, advance\n\npayments or guarantees to members of the Supervisory Board, members of the Board of Management or any family member of such persons.\n\n## Shareholding requirements and share-matching\n\nBoard of Management members are expected to build up a shareholding requirement in the company. The minimum shareholding requirement must be accrued within five years. This includes privately purchased shares and vested shares granted under AkzoNobel share-based compensation plans. The minimum shareholding requirement is 300% of annual base salary for the CEO and 150% of annual base salary for the CFO.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, CEO Greg Poux-Guillaume held zero shares. CFO Maarten de Vries held 21,766 shares. Shares acquired by the CFO during 2022 contribute towards his required shareholding. On December 31, 2022, he fulfilled this requirement by holding the equivalent of 187% of his annual base salary.\n\nShares obtained by Board of Management members under the performancerelated share plan are taken into account for share ownership purposes once they become unconditional. This includes vested shares to be retained during the two-year blocking period after vesting.",

2022. Reference is made to the table above on outstanding potential matching shares.\n\n## Board contracts\n\nAgreements for Board of Management members are in principle concluded for a period not exceeding four years. After the initial term, reappointments may take place for consecutive periods of up to four years each. At the 2022 AGM, CFO Maarten de Vries was reappointed for a four-year period. His reappointment was\n\nsupported with 99.96% of the votes. At the 2022 EGM, CEO Greg PouxGuillaume was appointed for a period ending at the AGM to be held in 2027. His appointment was supported with 99.37% of the votes.\n\nThe notice period by the Board member, and by the company, shall be subject to a six-month term. In the event that a Board member is not reappointed, or the agreement ends for other reasons than urgent cause or serious culpable acts or omissions by the Board member, a one-off gross severance payment will\n\nbe made, equal to the annual gross base salary in force at the time of the agreement's termination. Members of the Board of Management normally retire in the year they reach legal retirement age.\n\n## Comparative information\n\nInternal pay ratios are a relevant input factor for determining the appropriateness of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy, as recognized in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. In 2022, the ratio between the annual total compensation for the CEO and the average annual compensation for an employee was 59.8 (2021: 115.7). Further details on the development of these amounts and ratios over time can be found above.",

        "page_content": "Over the years of transition, between 2018 and 2020 the company's financial performance fluctuated significantly as the table on this page shows. In 2018, net profits were exceptionally high, mainly due to the divestment of Specialty Chemicals, with a deal result of \u20ac5,811 million after tax. The transition was also reflected in the development of remuneration. In 2018, the increase in average salary was influenced by the inclusion of a one-off \u20ac57 million pension cost for the UK guaranteed minimum pension equalizations.\n\nIn 2020, total rewards (including benefits) for the Board of Management included a one-off special payment for the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan, which incentivized improvement on the company's return on sales (ROS). The plan was put in place and approved by the AGM following the divestment of Specialty Chemicals.\n\nIn 2021, total rewards (including benefits) for the CEO included a one-off special share grant to compensate for the loss of shares due to the two-year reappointment and the fact that shares granted as from 2021 will only vest on a pro-rated basis.\n\n## Fixed base fee\n\n## Audit Committee fee\n\n| Chair   | Deputy Chair   | Member           |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|\n|         | \u20ac93,000        | \u20ac150,000 \u20ac80,000 |\n\n| Chair   | Member   |\n|---------|----------|\n| \u20ac25,000 | \u20ac20,000  |\n\n| Chair   | Member   |\n|---------|----------|\n| \u20ac20,000 | \u20ac15,000  |\n\n## 2022 Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nCommittee\n\n| in \u20ac                            | Remuneration   | Attendance fee   | allowance fees   | Total remuneration   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Nils Smedegaard Andersen, Chair | 150,000        | 12,500           | 20,000           | 182,500              |\n| Byron Grote, Deputy Chair       | 93,000         | 12,500           | 25,000           | 130,500              |\n| Pamela Kirby                    | 80,000         | 10,000           | 15,000           | 105,000              |\n| Dick Sluimers                   | 80,000         | -                | 20,000           | 100,000              |\n| Ester Baiget 1                  | 55,165         | 5,000            | 13,791           | 73,956               |\n| Patrick Thomas                  | 80,000         | 5,000            | 20,000           | 105,000              |\n| Hans Van Bylen 1                | 55,165         | 5,000            | 10,343           | 70,508               |\n| Jolanda Poots-Bijl              | 80,000         | -                | 20,000           | 100,000              |\n| Total 2022                      | 673,330        | 50,000           | 144,135          | 867,465              |\n| Total 2021                      | 612,670        | 7,500            | 130,866          | 751,036              |\n\n1 As of April 23, 2022.\n\n2022 presented us with the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the geo-political consequences of the war in Ukraine, shortages and significant price increases in raw materials and transportation. This volatile business climate had a severe impact on the results of the company. Consequently, all financial components of the Short and Long-Term Incentives did not meet the threshold and delivered no pay-out. This reduced performance linked payments in the current financial year.\n\nThe annualized total compensation for Thierry Vanlancker reduced by 65% compared with 2021, to \u20ac1,912,210 versus \u20ac5,514,195 in the previous year. This reflects the fact that his ShortTerm Incentive paid out around half and no shares granted under the LTI plan 2020 vested. Compared with 2021, the annualized total compensation for Maarten de Vries reduced by 48%.\n\nAkzoNobel aims to attract and retain high caliber members of the Board of Management. Competitive and motivating remuneration packages are an important element of such attraction and retention. The significant reduction in compensation of the CFO in 2022,\n\ncoupled with the projected limited vesting of the 2021 Long-Term Incentive plan - which vests at the end of 2023 and was based on the abandoned \u20ac2 billion EBITDA target - is a cause for concern. The Supervisory Board decided not to apply any discretion to mitigate this impact in 2022 and does not intend to apply discretion to the 2021 Long-Term Incentive plan, in line with last year's feedback from our stakeholders. Specific retention measures for the CFO may therefore be proposed for shareholder consideration.\n\n## Remuneration for the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members receive a fixed annual fee for their membership and one or more fixed committee fee(s). In addition, Supervisory Board members receive an attendance fee for any Supervisory Board or committee meetings they attend outside their country of residence (\u20ac2,500 for continental meetings and \u20ac5,000 for intercontinental meetings).

In accordance with the Code, members are not remunerated in shares. A five-year overview of the total remuneration of the Supervisory Board is\n\npresented below.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for 2023\n\nThe remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board were reviewed by the Supervisory Board in 2020/2021 and approved at the AGM in 2021, taking into consideration input from stakeholders, the requirements of the EU Directive on the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement (SRD II) and the Dutch regulation implementing this Directive. At the AGM in 2022, an amendment regarding the STI metrics in the Policy was approved.\n\nOperating cash flow (OCF) has been replaced by free cash flow (FCF). The amended Policy became effective (retroactively) from January 1, 2022, and will remain effective until a new Policy is approved, which will be proposed to shareholders no later than the AGM in 2025.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management, last approved at the 2022 AGM, is in line with the company's objectives. The remuneration it provides is balanced and adequate and will remain unchanged. The disclosure on the Policy has been extended to provide additional insight to comply with SRD II. For implementation in 2023, the Supervisory Board has decided that:\n\n- \u00b7  The base salary of the CEO was agreed upon when he was hired on October 1, 2022, and will remain in force until January 1, 2024. The base salary of the CFO will be increased by 3%, in line with the salary adjustments applied for AkzoNobel employees in the Netherlands\n- - Greg Poux-Guillaume, CEO: \u20ac1,225,000\n- - Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac749,600\n- \u00b7  Metrics applied for STI in 2022 were adjusted OPI and FCF, as per the Remuneration Policy, to support the company's strategy and will continue to apply in 2023\n- \u00b7  Metrics applied for LTI will remain the same, in line with the strategic direction of the company, and will continue to include ESG metrics\n\n## Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board - approved at the AGM on April 22, 2021 - is in line with the objectives of the company.

The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809. We have attached a list of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, drawn up in conformity with Articles 379 and 414 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as an appendix to our annual report. The principal activity of AkzoNobel is the production and selling of paints and coatings.\n\nWe have prepared the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Consolidated financial statements also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe Management report within the meaning of Article 391 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code consists of the following parts of the annual report:\n\n- \u00b7  2022 results at a glance\n- \u00b7  CEO statement\n- \u00b7  How we created value\n- \u00b7  Strategy and operations\n- \u00b7  Sustainability statements\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Our Board of Management and Executive Committee\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Statement of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Corporate governance statement\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Risk management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Integrity and compliance management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Remuneration report\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 6 Operating income\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 27 Financial risk management\n\nOn February 27, 2023, the Board of Management authorized the financial statements for issue. The financial statements as presented in this report are subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on April 21, 2023.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, resulting from management's assessment of the ability of AkzoNobel to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nManagement has assessed the ability of AkzoNobel to continue as a going concern based on an evaluation of, amongst others, the financial position, expected future cash flows and market developments.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac1.5 billion. We also assessed the ability of the company to obtain financing, taking into account the company's external credit rating which we are committed to retain at strong investment grade.\n\nExpected future cash flows are based on the latest forecasts. These forecasts take into account internal and external developments relevant in the assessment of the ability of AkzoNobel to continue as a going concern, including but not limited to market developments (see disclosure on e.g. impact from the war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia in this Note), developments in the macro-economic environment (e.g. inflation, see disclosure on inflation in this Note) and climate-related developments (see disclosure on climate change in this Note).\n\nManagement's assessment did not lead to uncertainties in relation to AkzoNobel's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe potential effects on the financial statements of climate change have been assessed. This includes the impact of physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events and transitional risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. Also considered were AkzoNobel's commitments to reduce carbon emissions as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and related estimates as to investments and the timing thereof. The resulting impact on the financial statements, including in the areas of fixed assets depreciation and recoverability assessments, was not material to AkzoNobel's financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## IMPACT FROM THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA\n\nOur business in Ukraine and Russia combined represents about 2% of our revenue (2021: 2%), of which the vast majority concerned Russia.\n\nFollowing the EU sanctions, the majority of our Performance Coatings activities in Russia was suspended and the residual Russian business is locally operated. AkzoNobel has assessed the potential accounting impact from the localization of the Russian business. Taking into account the applicable IFRS standards, we have concluded that our Russian business can still be included in our scope of consolidation.\n\nNo significant impairments of assets occurred in Russia; in Ukraine, the value of the assets is immaterial.\n\n## IMPACT OF INFLATION\n\nThe financial year 2022 was a year of significant inflation due to geopolitical and macro-economic developments. The impacts from rising inflation have been considered in the financial statements where relevant. Reference is made to Note 6 Operating income on financial developments in the year, Note 11 Intangible assets on the annual impairment testing process, Note 16 on the impact of raw material increases, Note 19 Post-retirement benefit provi-",

Subsidiaries are companies over which Akzo Nobel N.V. has control, because it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect returns through its power over the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests in equity and in results are presented separately.\n\n## CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FIRST TIME APPLICATION\n\nAccounting pronouncements with potential relevance for AkzoNobel, which became effective for 2022 (amendments to IFRS 3 'Reference to the Conceptual Framework', amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use', amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract' and 'Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020') had no material impact on our Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of our business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction within one year rather than through continuing use. When reclassifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognize the assets and liabilities at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated and amortized but tested for impairment. In case of discontinued operations, the comparative figures in the Consolidated statement of income and Consolidated statement of cash flows are represented. The balance sheet comparative figures are not represented.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the financial statements are the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Scope of consolidation, including purchase price allocations for business combinations (Note 2)\n- \u00b7  Income tax and deferred tax assets, including uncertain tax positions (Note 9)\n- \u00b7  Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (Note 11, 12, 13)\n- \u00b7  Post-retirement benefit provisions (Note 19)\n- \u00b7  Provisions and contingent liabilities (Note 20)\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (NOTE 2)\n\nIn business combinations, identifiable assets and liabilities, and contingent liabilities are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. Determining the fair value requires significant judgments on future cash flows to be generated.\n\nGoodwill in a business combination represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of an acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of income.\n\nThe fair value of brands, customer relationships and know-how acquired in a business combination is estimated using generally accepted valuation methods. These include the relief-from-royalty method, the incremental cash flow method and the multi-period excess earnings method.\n\nThe fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination is based on estimated market  values.\n\nThe fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale and a reasonable profit margin, based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nWe have used the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated at transaction rates. Acquisitions or divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of, respectively. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged items.\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe determine and present operating segments based on the information that is provided to the Executive Committee, our chief operating decision-maker during 2022, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Segment results reported to the Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise of corporate assets and corporate costs and are reported in 'Corporate and other'.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCIES\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency differences are included in the statement of income in financing income and expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominat-",

The income and expenses of entities with other functional currencies are translated into the functional currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.\n\nWhen a subsidiary is operating in a hyperinflationary country, the financial statements of this entity are restated into the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period. Hyperinflation accounting is applied for Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye based on the historical cost approach and using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nCPI rate developments for Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye are included in the table 'CPI rates at December 31'.\n\n## CPI rates at December 31\n\n| Country   |   2020 |   2021 | 2022   |\n|-----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Argentina |    386 |    582 | 1,135  |\n| T\u00fcrkiye   |    505 |    687 | 1,128  |\n\nFor a consolidated overview of financial impacts from hyperinflation accounting, refer to Note 8.\n\nForeign exchange rate differences resulting from translation into the functional currency of investments in subsidiaries and of intercompany loans of a permanent nature with other functional currencies are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserve) within other comprehensive income. These cumulative translation adjustments are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the statement of income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation of the foreign subsidiary to which the investment or the intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates. Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as an effective hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the cumulative translation reserve (in other comprehensive income).\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES OF KEY CURRENCIES\n\nThe principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the balance sheet and the statement of income are (table shows foreign currency equivalents of 1 euro):\n\n|                |   Balance sheet |   Balance sheet | Balance sheet   |   Statement of income |   Statement of income | Statement of income   |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                |        2021     |        2022     | %               |              2021     |              2022     | %                     |\n| US dollar      |           1.131 |           1.067 | (5.7)           |                 1.182 |                 1.053 | (10.9)                |\n| Pound sterling |           0.837 |           0.884 | 5.6             |                 0.86  |                 0.853 | (0.8)                 |\n| Chinese yuan   |           7.197 |           7.426 | 3.2             |                 7.626 |                 7.086 | (7.1)                 |\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION (NOTE 5)\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nAkzoNobel's main business consists of straightforward selling of goods (paints and coatings) to customers at contractually determined prices and conditions without any additional services. Although the transfer of risks and rewards is not the only criterion to be considered to determine whether control over the goods has transferred, it is in most situations considered to be the main indicator of the customer's ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the asset and largely also coincides with the physical transfer of the goods and the obligation of the customer to pay.\n\nVariable considerations, including among others rebates, bonuses, discounts and payments to customers, are accrued for as performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized. Variable considerations are only recognized when it is highly probable that these are not subject to significant reversal. In case of expected returns, no revenue is recognized for such products, but a refund liability and an asset for the right to recover the to be returned products are recorded. A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based on historical warranty data. Revenue is recognized net of rebates, discounts and similar allowances, and net of sales tax.\n\n## Equipment provided to customers\n\nAkzoNobel regularly provides mixing machines, store interior and other assets to its customers at the start of a paints or coatings delivery contract. The delivery of such\n\nassets qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Revenue can only be recognized at the moment of transfer of such assets, when there is an agreed sales price or when there is a binding take-or-pay commitment for a minimum quantity of paints or coatings to be acquired by the customer.\n\n## Services\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain training, technical or support services to customers as well as shipping and handling activities for its customers. Service revenue is recognized over time when the related services are being provided. When not separately invoiced, part of the sales price of paints or coatings is allocated to such services.\n\n## POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 19)\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of income as incurred.\n\nMost of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than pensions to certain employees, which are generally not funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are carried out by independent actuaries based on the projected unit credit method. Post-retirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for projected benefits based on employee service during the year and interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset. When the calculation results in a benefit to AkzoNobel, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The effect of these so-called asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein are recognized in other comprehensive income. Remeasurement gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations, are recognized in other comprehensive income. When the benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased benefits related to past service by employees is recognized as an expense in the statement of income immediately. We recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or settle-",

Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in operating income, unless recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 20)\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits are measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (NOTE 7)\n\nAkzoNobel has a performance-related and a restricted share plan as well as a share-matching plan, under which shares are conditionally granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured at grant date and amortized over the three-year period during which the employees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting or settlement.\n\n## INCOME TAX (NOTE 9)\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax we also take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes may be due. Income tax is recognized in the statement of income, unless it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.\n\nCurrent tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at reporting date, as well as (any adjustments to) tax payables and receivables with respect to previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated financial statements. We do not recognize deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future and we can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Deferred tax positions are not discounted.\n\n## EARNINGS PER SHARE (NOTE 10)\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for any repurchased shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year for the diluting effect of the shares of the performance-related share plan, the restricted share plan and the share-matching plan.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share from continuing operations excluding identified items, after taxes.\n\n## GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants related to costs are deducted from the relevant costs to be compensated in the same period. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Emission rights granted by the government are recorded at cost.\n\nA provision is recorded if the actual emission is higher than the emission rights granted.\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOTE 11)\n\nIntangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill and certain brands, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually using the value-in-use method.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses, know-how, certain brands, customer relationships, intellectual property rights, emission rights, software expenditures (in as far as AkzoNobel controls the software configured or customized) and capitalized development costs, are capitalized at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from 5 to 40 years for brands with finite useful lives, 5 to 25 years for customer relationships and 3 to 15 years for other intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Research expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (NOTE 12)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost of capital investment projects under construction.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset components.The useful life of plant equipment and machinery generally ranges from 10 to 25 years, and for buildings ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. In the majority of cases, residual value is assumed to be not significant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.\n\nCosts of major maintenance activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. Maintenance costs which cannot be separately defined as a component of property, plant and equipment are expensed in the",

We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.\n\n## LEASES (NOTE 13, 21)\n\nAs a lessee, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for the leases of cars we have elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset value contains lease prepayments, lease incentives received, the initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration, removal and dismantling costs. For deferred taxes associated with lease accounting under IFRS 16, AkzoNobel determines the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of the right-ofuse asset and the lease liability on a net basis. It is the company's view that these are integrally linked. As a result, a deferred tax position is reported on the net temporary differences of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term or shorter economic life. In addition, the value of right-of-use assets is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe net present value of the lease liability is measured at the discounted value of the lease payments. The liability includes payments to be made in optional periods if it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to extend the lease, or that we will not exercise an option\n\nto terminate the lease. The lease payments comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives\n- \u00b7  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7  The exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised\n- \u00b7  Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease; and\n- \u00b7  Amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees\n\nThese lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease contract, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate is used. We determine our incremental borrowing rates by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and make certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease and type of the asset leased. At the lease commencement dates, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the extension options. We reassess whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within our control.\n\nAt the commencement date, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that:\n\n- \u00b7  An option to extend is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to purchase is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to terminate the lease is not exercised\n\nIn making these assessments, all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for us to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option are considered.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nWe do not record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. We recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## IMPAIRMENTS (NOTE 11, 12, 13)\n\nWe assess the carrying value of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable as a result of e.g. changes in cash flow forecasts, damages, market developments or environmental and climate change risks. In addition, for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the carrying value is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income on the functional level of the asset impaired. The assessment for impairment is performed at the lowest level of assets generating largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life, we have determined this to be at business unit level (one level below operating segment).\n\nExcept for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the statement of income if and to the extent we have identified a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (NOTE 14)\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated financial statements include our share of the income and expenses of the associates and joint ventures, whereby the result is determined using our accounting principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest in the investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we have further legal or constructive obligations.\n\n## INVENTORIES (NOTE 16)\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and",

        "page_content": "condition. The costs of inventories are determined using weighted average cost.\n\n## PROVISIONS (NOTE 20)\n\nWe recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value. The increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognized in the statement of income under financing income and expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities are recognized when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future operating costs.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Classification\n\nAll assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets are classified according to a model based on:\n\n- \u00b7  A contractual cash flow characteristics test\n- \u00b7  A business model dictating how the reporting entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows as either:\n- 1. Hold to collect contractual cash flows\n- 2. Collect contractual cash flows and sell\n- 3. Neither 1 or 2\n- \u00b7  Election of the fair value option in some specific cases in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is determined at initial recognition, but if certain conditions are met, an asset might be subject to reclassification.\n\n## Valuation and impairment\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for impairment either according to the general approach or a simplified approach.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the general approach uses the following stages:\n\n- \u00b7  12-month expected credit losses; taking into account possible default events within one year\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses in case of an increase in credit risk; through recognition of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the exposure\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses, where interest is calculated on the net amount of the receivables less impairment loss\n\nIn all above stages, the impairment calculation used is based on external credit ratings of involved parties or default rates published by well-known credit risk agencies.\n\nThe financial assets included in the general impairment approach are long-term loans and other long-term receivables.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the simplified approach requires recognition of lifetime expected credit loss (no tracking of changes in credit risk). The financial assets included in the simplified impairment approach are trade receivables and the remaining financial assets.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegular purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for derivatives and cash and cash equivalents, the initial measurement of financial instruments is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments (Note 27)\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair values are derived from market prices and quotes from dealers and brokers or are estimated using observable market inputs. When determining fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for AkzoNobel, is taken into account.\n\nChanges in fair value are recognized in the statement of income, unless cash flow hedge accounting or net investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases, the effective part of the fair value changes is deferred in other comprehensive income and released to the related specific lines in the statement of income or balance sheet at the same time as the hedged item.\n\n## Financial non-current assets (Note 15) and Trade and other receivables (Note 17)\n\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments (Note 21)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are measured at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and other investments that are directly convertible into known amounts of cash. Changes in fair values are included in financing income and expenses.\n\n## Long-term and Short-term borrowings (Note 21, 27) and Trade and other payables (Note 22)\n\nLong-term and short-term borrowings, as well as trade and other payables, are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The interest expense on borrowings is included in financing income and expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for disclosure purposes, is determined based on listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is calculated based on the present value of principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the interest rate at the reporting date, considering AkzoNobel's credit risk.\n\n## NEW IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nIFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force, which may apply to our Consolidated financial statements for 2023 and beyond, have been assessed for their potential impact.\n\nThese include among others IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current', amendments to IAS 8 'Definition of Accounting Estimates', amendments to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction', amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies', amendments to IFRS 16 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback' and amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 'Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture'. These changes are not expected to have a material effect on AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements.",

Due to a legal entity reduction program, focusing on merging entities and liquidating dormant entities, we expect the number of legal entities to reduce in the coming years. We consider legal entities material when they represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than 5% of either revenue or operating income. Material subsidiaries included in the table below are fully owned at year-end 2022 except for Akzo Nobel India Limited, refer to Note 18 for an overview of non-controlling interests.\n\n## Material subsidiaries related to continuing operations\n\n| Legal entity                         | Principal place of  business/country of  incorporation   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc.             | US                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Paints (Shanghai) Co Ltd. | China                                                    |\n| Akzo Nobel India Limited             | India                                                    |\n| Imperial Chemical Industries Limited | UK                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings B.V.  | The Netherlands                                          |\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings SPA              | Italy                                                    |\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn April 22, 2022, AkzoNobel acquired 100% of the shares of Colombia based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis S.A. (Grupo Orbis) for \u20ac566 million. The acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America. The transaction includes eight operational manufacturing sites. Since its acquisition, Grupo Orbis contributed \u20ac336 million to revenue and \u20ac29 million to operating income. Based on financial information received from the acquiree, revenues for the period January 1, 2022 until the date of acquisition amounted to \u20ac123 million.\n\nBased on the provisional purchase price allocation, the transaction resulted in \u20ac262 million of goodwill (nondeductible for tax purposes), \u20ac259 million of other intangible assets and \u20ac121 million of property, plant and equipment. The purchase price allocation will be final-\n\nefore April 21, 2023. No material changes from the current purchase price allocation are expected.\n\nThe purchase price allocation was performed using the implied internal rate of return on management's forecasts. An assessment of the assumptions applied in estimating such forecasts was made, including potential synergies that are expected to be realized as a result of the transaction.\n\nThe goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the company into the group. The paints business of Grupo Orbis is being integrated in business unit Decorative Paints Latin America. The coatings businesses ultimately will be incorporated into the respective Performance Coatings business units in 2023. For the interim period, in 2022, these businesses are reported in business unit Performance Coatings Other.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, we acquired the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH for \u20ac36 million in an asset deal. The provisional purchase price allocation resulted in \u20ac7 million of goodwill (deductible for tax purposes), \u20ac17 million of other intangible assets and \u20ac14 million other fixed and current assets. The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the acquired business into the group. The purchase price is provisional due to the limited time between the date of acquisition and the reporting date. The contribution of the Lankwitzer business to the 2022 statement of income is not material. This business is being integrated in business unit Powder Coatings.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, AkzoNobel announced the intended acquisition of Kansai Paint's African paints and coatings activities. The intended acquisition is expected to further strengthen our activities in the region and provide opportunities for future growth. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.\n\nOn March 1, 2021, AkzoNobel acquired 100% of the shares of Industrias Titan S.A.U. (Titan Paints) in Spain, for \u20ac83 million. The acquisition strengthens our paints business and footprint in Spain. The transaction included three production facilities and seven logistics and service centers for decorative paints. Based on the final purchase price allocation, the transaction resulted in \u20ac16 million of goodwill (non-deductible for tax purposes), \u20ac20 million of\n\nother intangible assets and \u20ac47 million of property, plant and equipment. The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the company into the group. Titan Paints is being integrated in business unit Decorative Paints Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n\n## Recognized fair values at acquisition\n\n| In \u20ac millions                            | Grupo   Orbis S.A.,  Colombia   | Lankwitzer  Lackfabrik  GmbH,  Germany Other   |     | Total  2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----|---------------|\n| Other intangibles                        | 259                             | 17                                             | -   | 276           |\n| Property, plant and   equipment          | 121                             | 4                                              | -   | 125           |\n| Right-of-use assets                      | 8                               | 2                                              | -   | 10            |\n| Associates and joint  ventures           | 5                               | -                                              | -   | 5             |\n| Inventories                              | 91                              | 6                                              | -   | 97            |\n| Trade and other receivables              | 98                              | 2                                              | (1) | 99            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                | 14                              | -                                              | -   | 14            |\n| Long-term debt                           | (79)                            | (2)                                            | -   | (81)          |\n| Provisions                               | (9)                             | -                                              | -   | (9)           |\n| Deferred tax assets/                     | (104)                           | -                                              | -   | (104)         |\n| Non controlling interests                | (3)                             | -                                              | -   | (3)           |\n| Trade and other payables                 | (97)                            | -                                              | -   | (97)          |\n| Net identifiable assets  and liabilities | 304                             | 29                                             | (1) | 332           |\n| Goodwill                                 | 262                             | 7                                              | (7) | 262           |\n| Purchase consideration                   | 566                             | 36                                             | (8) | 594           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  acquired      | (14)                            | -                                              | -   | (14)          |\n| To be received in 2023 and  later years  | -                               | -                                              | 8   | 8             |\n| Net cash outflow                         | 552                             | 36                                             | -   | 588           |\n\n## Divestments\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, no significant divestments occurred.",

These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measures and should be used as supplementary information in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Alternative performance measures do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Where a non-financial measure is used to calculate an operational\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nor statistical ratio, this is also considered an alternative performance measure.\n\nOperating income, adjusted operating income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (and related measures) per segment for 2021 have been updated to reflect changes in the financial reporting structure related to a narrower definition of corporate activities and corporate costs in corporate and other activities.\n\nThe tables in this note reconcile the alternative performance measures used in the segment information (Note 3) to the nearest IFRS measure.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring costs primarily relate to costs for accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities.\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                                                | Continuing  operations   | Discontinued  operations   | 2021  Total   | Continuing  operations   | Discontinued  operations   | 2022  Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Operating income                                                             | 1,118                    | -

This STF decision covers a multi-year period prior to 2018. In 2021, a fullyear net gain of \u20ac64 million was recognized in net income, of which \u20ac42 million in Other results (in operating income), \u20ac28 million in interest income, \u20ac14 million in income tax (loss) and (net) \u20ac8 million in discontinued operations.\n\n## UK pensions past service credit\n\nFollowing a court decision in April 2021, which allowed the amendment of the scheme documentation of one of the company's UK pension funds, a past service credit (gain) was recognized in 2021.\n\n## APM adjustments to interest\n\nIn 2022, interest income of \u20ac10 million was recognized related to the UK ACT case, refer to a description of the ACT case below. Adjustments to interest in 2021 included an interest gain of \u20ac28 million from the Brazil ICMS case.\n\n## APM adjustments to income tax: UK ACT case\n\nIn July 2021 the UK Supreme Court issued a further decision in a group litigation case the company participates in ('Franked Investment Income'; filed in 2003).\n\nThe company assessed the consequences of this judgement in 2021 and performed a further file review which, taking into account legal advice, resulted in the recognition of a net tax benefit of \u20ac29 million in 2021. In 2022, upon finalization of the full assessment, a net tax charge of \u20ac13 million was recognized.\n\n## APM adjustments to income tax: Other items\n\nIn 2022, \u20ac19 million of tax benefits related to restructuring costs were recognized (2021: \u20ac8 million). The tax benefits have been partly offset by the \u20ac13 million net tax charge related to the UK ACT case.\n\nIn 2021, a gain of \u20ac12 million was included for the (net) re-recognition of deferred tax assets. This gain was partly offset by the income tax (loss) related to the Brazil ICMS case (\u20ac14 million) and the impact from tax rate changes (\u20ac19 million).",

Charges recognized in the 2022 statement of income for share-based compensation amounted to \u20ac16 million and are included in salaries and wages (2021: \u20ac18 million).\n\n## Performance-related and restricted share plans\n\nUnder the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plans, a number of conditional shares are granted to the members of the Board of Management, members of the Executive Committee, executives and certain other employee categories each year. The number of participants of the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plans at year-end 2022 was 616 (2021: 479). The shares of the performance-related and restricted share plan series 2019-2021 have vested and were delivered to the participants in 2022.\n\nThe performance targets for the conditional grant of performance-related shares of the 2020-2022 plan for the Board of Management and the Executive Committee are linked for 50% to the relative TSR performance of the company compared with the peer group and for 50% to the ROI performance of the company.

A two-year holding restriction applies.\n\nThe plans for the executives and certain non-executive employee categories are a restricted share plan without any performance conditions, whereby the conditional grant of shares will vest upon the condition that they remain in service with the company during the three-year vesting period. A one-year holding restriction applies for the executives.\n\nThe conditional shares of the 2020-2022 performance share plan for the AkzoNobel participants vested for 0% (series 2019-2021: 58.33%), including extraordinary dividend shares of 7.33% (series 2019-2021: 13.14%), the final vesting percentage amounted to 0% (series 2019-2021: 66.00%). The reason some shares still vest is because AkzoNobel is legally bound to an agreement with a former member of the Executive Committee regarding the vesting of shares for this individual, as well as a conditional share grant awarded to new Executive Committee Members at the time of their hiring, who received these grants as buy-out from the contract at their previous employer.\n\n## Share plans of AkzoNobel employees\n\n| Share plan                            | Performance/ Vesting period   | Award  date   | Vesting  date   | End of  holding  period   | Balance at  January 1,  2022   | Awarded  in 2022   | Vested in  2022   | Forfeited   in 2022   | Dividend in  2022   | Subject to   performance  condition   | Unvested   in 2022   | Subject  to holding  period   | Balance at  December  31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 2019 -

The fair value of the restricted shares of the 2022-2024 grant to non-executives, amounting to \u20ac76.50, is based on the average of the opening share prices during the grant period of April 26 until May 9, 2022, of \u20ac82.54 and the expected dividend yield of 2.40%. The fair value of the performance-related 2022-2024 grant, based on the opening share price on February 23, 2022, amounts to \u20ac88.28. The fair value of the performance-related share grant to Mr. Poux-Guillaume of the 2022-2024 series, that was approved in the EGM on September 6, 2022, based on the opening share price on October 3, 2022, amounts to \u20ac57.70. For the 2022-2024 and 2021-2023 grants of performance-related shares all conditions are non-market based performance conditions. The fair value of the 2021-2023 grant is based on the share price as per April 22, 2021, the date of the AGM at which the new LTI performance criteria for the Board of Management were approved. The fair value of the performance-related shares of the 2020-2022 grant is for 50% based on a market condition (TSR) and for 50% based on a non-market based performance conditions (ROI).\n\nThe TSR part of the award is valued applying a Monte Carlo simulation model and the other part is valued based on the share price at grant date. The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at grant date (opening of first trading date from grant date), expected volatility (based on the share price development over the past three years of AkzoNobel), and risk-free interest rate (based on a Dutch zero-coupon government bond).\n\n## Share-matching plan\n\nThe members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee are eligible to participate in the share-matching plan. Under certain conditions, members who invest part of their short-term incentive payment in AkzoNobel shares may have such shares matched by the company one-on-one. During 2022, no potential matching shares were matched as the\n\nmembers of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee were not eligible for matching shares on the 2019 series. In 2022, the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee invested part of their 2021 short-term incentive in AkzoNobel shares, leading to 4,877 potential matching shares on December 31, 2022. For an overview of the matching shares outstanding for the members of the Board of Management per December 31, 2022, we refer to the Remuneration report.\n\n## Fair value of matching shares\n\nThe fair value of the matching shares (\u20ac75.61) was based on the share price on the investment date (April 21, 2022: \u20ac81.40), discounted for expected dividends over the holding period (dividend yield: 2.43%).\n\n## Note 8  FINANCING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                          | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing income                                       | 12     | 19     |\n| Financing expenses                                     | (74)   | (106)  |\n| Net interest on net debt                               | (62)   | (87)   |\n| Other interest                                         |        |        |\n| Financing income related to post-retire- ment benefits | 13     | 18     |\n| Interest on provisions                                 | 3      | 17     |\n| Exchange rate results                                  | (21)   | (85)   |\n| Other items                                            | 28     | 13     |\n| Net other financing credit/(charges)                   | 23     | (37)   |\n| Total financing income and expenses                    | (39)   | (124)  |\n\nNet financing expenses for the year were \u20ac124 million (2021: \u20ac39 million). Significant variances are:\n\n- \u00b7  Net interest on net debt increased by \u20ac25 million to \u20ac87 million (2021: \u20ac62 million) mainly as a result of higher interest cost on debt from bonds issuance, increased short-term debt and financing related to the Grupo Orbis acquisition\n- \u00b7  Interest income on provisions increased by \u20ac14 million to \u20ac17 million (2021: \u20ac3 million) due to the impact from discounting at higher discount rates\n- \u00b7  Exchange rate results were \u20ac85 million negative (2021: \u20ac21 million negative), and include \u20ac20 million expenses from Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye hyperinflation accounting\n- \u00b7  Other items in 2022 include \u20ac10 million interest income from the UK ACT case (refer to Note 4 for further details on the UK ACT case). In 2021, an interest income of \u20ac28 million related to the Brazil ICMS case was included.\n\nThe average interest rate used for capitalized interest was 1.7% (2021: 1.9%). Capitalized interest was negligible in both 2022 and 2021. The average interest rate on total debt was 2.1% (2021: 2.3%).\n\n## Accounting impact hyperinflation accounting\n\nWe have applied IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' for T\u00fcrkiye as from January 1, 2022. For Argentina, hyperinflation accounting was already applied as from January 1, 2018. In addition, and in line with IAS 21 'The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates', end of month rates are used to translate both the balance sheet and the statement of income into euros. For T\u00fcrkiye, the revaluation effect on the non-monetary assets at January 1, 2022, was \u20ac16 million positive (after taxes), recorded as a restatement to opening shareholders' equity. In addition, the opening balance of intangible assets has been restated by \u20ac1 million (refer to Note 11) and the opening balance of property, plant and equipment has been restated by \u20ac15 million (refer to Note 12). Refer to Note 9 Income tax for the related opening balance impact on deferred taxes.\n\nThe application of hyperinflation accounting and the use of end of month rates to translate the statement of income into euros resulted in an \u20ac5 million positive impact on revenues, an \u20ac46 million negative impact on operating income and an \u20ac63 million negative impact on net income for the year.\n\n## Note 9  INCOME TAX\n\nPre-tax income from continuing operations for the year amounted to a profit of \u20ac602 million (2021: \u20ac1,105 million). The net tax charges related to continuing operations are included in the statement of income as shown in this Note and amount to \u20ac214 million (2021: \u20ac246 million), leading to an effective tax rate of 35.5% (2021: 22.3%).",

For comparative reasons, this table presents the income tax expense excluding the impact from discontinued operations. The total deferred tax in the statement of income including discontinued operations was a credit of \u20ac8 million (2021: \u20ac77 million charge). The total tax charge including discontinued operations was \u20ac211 million (2021: \u20ac248 million).\n\nAdjustments for prior years in 2022 is mainly related to a net tax charge of \u20ac13 million for the UK Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT) case, which is further described in Note 4 on Alternative Performance Measures due to its identified nature. Origination and reversal of temporary differences and tax losses is driven, amongst others, by timing differences between recognition and payments for provisions, timing differences on depreciation and amortization for tax purposes versus the consolidated financial statements, and tax loss carryforwards utilized against profits of the year or new tax losses incurred. Changes in tax rates in 2022 mainly relate to the changes in the UK tax rate (2021: Dutch and UK tax rates).\n\n## Effective tax rate reconciliation\n\nIn 2022, the effective income tax rate based on the statement of income is 35.5% (2021: 22.3%).

Based on the Dutch tax system there is a limited credit for such taxes.\n\nAdjustments for prior years in 2022 is mainly related to the UK Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT) case, which is further described in Note 4 on Alternative Performance Measures due to its identified nature.\n\nChanges in tax rates in 2022 mainly relate to the changes in the UK tax rate (2021: Dutch and UK tax rates).\n\n## Origination of deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities originate from temporary differences in various balance sheet line items, as well as from tax credits and tax loss carryforwards. The tables on the previous page show the origination of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the movements thereof, for the financial years 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Reconciliation deferred tax assets and liabilities to the balance sheet\n\nThe table on the left provides a reconciliation of the total deferred tax amounts for each of the originating items to the deferred tax asset and liability positions as included in the balance sheet.\n\n## Deferred tax assets recoverability assessment\n\nIn assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could change if future estimates of projected taxable income during the carryforward period are revised. The majority of the amount of the non-current portion of deferred and current taxes will be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, deferred tax asset recoverability has been assessed using taxable profit forecasts. In 2022, these assessments did not result in a significant net derecognition or re-recognition of deferred tax assets (2021: net re-recognition of \u20ac18 million).\n\nBoth in 2022 and 2021, deferred tax assets not recognized relate to tax loss carryforwards. The losses in the tables on tax losses carried forward are gross amounts, with the tax impact included in the last column of the table.\n\nFrom the total amount of recognized net deferred tax assets, \u20ac206 million (2021: \u20ac151 million) is related to entities that have suffered a loss in either the current or the previous year and where utilization is dependent on future taxable profit in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. This assessment is based on management's long-term projections and tax planning strategies.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, branches",

The recently announced safe harbor rules are likely to limit the financial impact in particular during the 3-year transitional period during which these safe harbor rules apply.\n\n## Note 10 EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nProfit for the period attributable to the shareholders of the company was \u20ac352 million (2021: \u20ac829 million).\n\n## Profit for the period\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                                                                     | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax from continuing  operations                                                     | 1,105  | 602    |\n| Income tax                                                                                        | (246)  | (214)  |\n| Profit from continuing opera- tions                                                               | 859    | 388    |\n| Profit for the period attributable to  non-controlling interests                                  | (36)   | (26)   |\n| Profit for the period from  continuing operations attribut- able to shareholders of the  company  | 823    | 362    |\n| Profit for the period from discon- tinued operations attributable to  shareholders of the company | 6      | (10)   |\n| Profit for the period attributable  to shareholders of the company                                | 829    | 352    |\n\nThe number of shares for the earnings per share calculation decreased as a result of the share buyback programs of 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Weighted average number of common shares\n\n| Number of shares                                | 2021        | 2022        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Issued common shares at  January 1              | 190,579,841 | 181,609,509 |\n| Effect of issued common shares  during the year | 225,806     | 186,077     |\n| Effect of share buyback program                 | (5,845,781) | (7,060,447) |\n| Shares for basic earnings per                   | 184,959,866 | 174,735,139 |\n| Effect of dilutive shares                       |             |             |\n| For performance-related and  restricted shares  | 714,114     | 575,108     |\n| For share-matching plan                         | -           | 3,251       |\n| Shares for diluted earnings   per share         | 185,673,980 | 175,313,498 |\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| in \u20ac                    | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Continuing operations   |        |        |\n| Basic                   | 4.45   | 2.07   |\n| Diluted                 | 4.43   | 2.06   |\n| Discontinued operations |        |        |\n| Basic                   | 0.03   | (0.06) |\n| Diluted                 | 0.03   | (0.05) |\n| Total operations        |        |        |\n| Basic                   | 4.48   | 2.01   |\n| Diluted                 | 4.46   | 2.01   |\n\nRefer to Note 4 for the calculation of adjusted earnings per share.",

IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' has been applied for our activities in T\u00fcrkiye as from January 1, 2022. Refer to Note 8 for details on the financial impact from applying IAS 29.\n\nBrands as included in the table on the left comprise of brands with indefinite useful lives and brands with finite useful lives. Brands with indefinite useful lives are almost fully related to Dulux, which is the major brand, due to its global presence, high recognition and strategic nature. Other intangibles include licenses, know-how, intellectual property rights, software and development cost. Both at year-end 2022 and 2021, there were no material purchase commitments for individual intangible assets. No intangible assets were registered as security for bank loans.\n\n## Acquisitions through business combinations\n\nThe additions from acquisitions in 2022 primarily relate to the acquisition of Grupo Orbis S.A., Colombia, and of the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH, Germany. In 2021, additions from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Titan Paints in Spain. Refer to Note 2 for disclosures on acquisitions.\n\n## Changes in exchange rates\n\nChanges in exchange rates includes a \u20ac15 million positive adjustment from the IAS 29 hyperinflation impact for T\u00fcrkiye and Argentina.\n\n## Annual impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment per business unit (one level below segment level) annually or whenever an impairment trigger exists, applying the value-in-use method.\n\nThe paints business of recently acquired Grupo Orbis has been allocated to business unit Decorative Paints Latin America. The Grupo Orbis coatings businesses ultimately will be incorporated into the respective Performance Coatings business units in 2023. For the interim period, in 2022, these businesses are reported in business unit Performance Coatings Other.\n\nThe impairment test is in principle based on cash flow projections of the five-year plan. Elements considered to determine if a different approach would be more appropriate are mainly related to high growth/emerging economies, geo expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities from market consolidation. In 2022, the above exception was applied for Decorative Paints Asia, Decorative Paints Latin America and Performance Coatings Other (Grupo Orbis), for which the revenue growth and margin development projections were",

refer to Note 1 for a description of the impact from climate change on the financial statements) are closely monitored to ensure that the impact on the estimated future cash flows is reflected in the models which are used to assess the value of AkzoNobel's asset base.\n\n## Key assumptions 2022\n\n| In % per year        | Average revenue  growth 2023-2027   | Pre-tax weighted  average cost of  capital 2023-2027   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decorative Paints    | 1.8-6.7%                            | 11.1-15.9%                                             |\n| Performance Coatings | 1.3-4.0%                            | 10.8-12.4%                                             |\n\n## Key assumptions 2021\n\n| In % per year        | Average revenue  growth 2022-2026   | Pre-tax weighted  average cost of  capital 2022-2026   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decorative Paints    | 1.1-5.9%                            | 8.4-12.5%                                              |\n| Performance Coatings | 2.6-4.7%                            | 7.8-8.1%                                               |\n\nThe key assumptions used in the projections for annual impairment testing are:\n\n- \u00b7  Revenue growth per year: based on actual experience, analysis of markets and GDP growth, and expected market share developments\n- \u00b7  Margin development per year: based on actual experience and management's long-term projections\n- \u00b7  Weighted average cost of capital per year: the pre-tax discount rate determined per business unit, reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifically associated with the business units\n\nFor all business units, a terminal value was calculated based on long-term inflation expectations of 2% (2021: 1%). The estimated pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rates are determined for each business unit and range from 10.8% to 15.9% (2021: 7.8% to 12.5%), with a weighted average of 11.7% (2021: 8.4%).\n\nSensitivity tests were performed to assess the impact of changes in the key assumptions revenue growth (50% lower), margin development (1 percentage point lower) and the weighted average cost of capital (1 percentage point higher). These assessments show that these changes in key assumptions would not cause carrying amounts to exceed recoverable amounts for any of the business units, except for the Latin America businesses where the recently acquired Grupo Orbis business is included.\n\nGiven the current uncertainties in the macro-economic environment and high cost inflation, additional sensitivity tests have been performed in order to assess the impact of more severe adverse changes in the key assumptions. The conclusions from these tests are the same as above.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, no impairment charges were recognized in relation to the annual impairment test.\n\n## Specific asset impairments\n\nPeriodical evaluations are performed in order to ensure timely detection of triggers that might indicate impairment of assets. Whenever such triggers are noted, the related assets are assessed for impairment as appropriate.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, no significant impairment charges were recorded in relation to specific assets.\n\n## Note 12 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe additions from acquisitions in 2022 primarily relate to the acquisition of Grupo Orbis S.A., Colombia, and of the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH, Germany. In 2021, additions from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Titan Paints in Spain. Refer to Note 2 for disclosures on acquisitions.\n\n## Investments in property, plant and equipment\n\nLarge investment projects in 2022 are amongst others investments at our Highpoint, US, Wood Coatings site, and the setup of a new powder coatings manufacturing line at our Hanoi, Vietnam site.\n\n## Impairments\n\nPeriodical evaluations are performed in order to ensure timely detection of triggers that might indicate impairment of assets. Whenever such triggers are noted, the related assets are assessed for impairment as appropriate.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, no significant impairments were recognized.\n\n## Changes in exchange rates\n\nChanges in exchange rates includes a \u20ac30 million positive adjustment from the IAS 29 hyperinflation impact for T\u00fcrkiye and Argentina.",

Some leases provide for additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices.\n\nSome property leases contain extension options exercisable by AkzoNobel up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. We have estimated that the lease liability would increase by less than 20%, if we would exercise the extension options which are currently not included in the valuation of the lease liability. This excludes so-called 'evergreens' or perpetual leases.\n\nTotal net cash outflow from financing activities related to leases recognized on the balance sheet was \u20ac104 million (2021: \u20ac100 million). Net cash outflow for leases not recognized on the balance sheet was \u20ac19 million (2021: \u20ac17 million).\n\nRefer to Note 27 'Financial risk management' for the maturities of lease liabilities.\n\nThe table 'Income/(expenses) recognized in profit and loss' shows the total impact from leases on our profit and loss account.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\n| In \u20ac millions                            | Land   | Buildings   | Other   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2021               |        |             |         |         |\n| Cost of acquisition                      | 55     | 353         | 102     | 510     |\n| Accumulated depreciation/impairment      | (16)   | (128)       | (42)    | (186)   |\n| Carrying value at January 1, 2021        | 39     | 225         | 60      | 324     |\n| Movements in 2021                        |        |             |         |         |\n| Additions/modifications                  | 2      | 35          | 32      | 69      |\n| Disposals                                | -      | (5)         | (2)     | (7)     |\n| Depreciation                             | (3)    | (60)        | (31)    | (94)    |\n| Impairments, including reversals thereof | -      | (2)         | -       | (2)     |\n| Changes in exchange rates                | 4      | 9           | 1       | 14      |\n| Total movements                          | 3      | (23)        | -       | (20)    |\n| Cost of acquisition                      | 61     | 372         | 109     | 542     |\n| Accumulated depreciation/impairment      | (19)   | (170)       | (49)    | (238)   |\n| Carrying value at December 31, 2021      | 42     | 202         | 60      | 304     |\n| Movements in 2022                        |        |             |         |         |\n| Acquisitions                             | 2      | 5           | 3       | 10      |\n| Additions/modifications                  | -      | 58          | 30      | 88      |\n| Disposals                                | -      | (7)         | (2)     | (9)     |\n| Depreciation                             | (3)    | (64)        | (31)    | (98)    |\n| Impairments, including reversals thereof | -      | (3)         | -       | (3)     |\n| Changes in exchange rates                | 1      | (2)         | -       | (1)     |\n| Total movements                          | -      | (13)        | -       | (13)    |\n| Cost of acquisition                      | 64     | 393         | 117     | 574     |\n| Accumulated depreciation/impairment      | (22)   | (204)       | (57)    | (283)   |\n| Carrying value at December 31, 2022      | 42     | 189         | 60      | 291     |\n\n## Income/(expenses) recognized in profit and loss\n\n| In \u20ac millions                         | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sub lease income                      | 3      | 2      |\n| Depreciation right-of-use assets      | (94)   | (98)   |\n| Impairments for right-of-use assets   | (2)    | (3)    |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities | (6)    | (6)    |\n| Short-term lease expenses             | (7)    | (11)   |\n| Expenses relating to low-value assets | (5)    | (4)    |\n| Variable lease expenses               | (5)    | (4)    |\n| Total expenses                        | (116)  | (124)  |\n\n## Impairments\n\nPeriodical evaluations are performed in order to ensure timely detection of triggers that might indicate impairment of assets.

In 2022, an interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 (2021: \u20ac0.44) per common share was paid. We propose a 2022 final divi-\n\n of \u20ac1.54 (2021: \u20ac1.54) per common share, which would equal a total 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.98 (2021: \u20ac1.98).\n\n## Share buybacks\n\nIn February 2021, a \u20ac1 billion share buyback program was announced, which was completed in January 2022.\n\nIn February 2022, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced which was completed in 2022. As at December 31, 2022, a total of 7.3 million shares had been acquired under this program, of which 3.3 million were cancelled.\n\nDuring 2022, 8,651,230 common shares were repurchased (2021: 11,296,283). The total amount of shares cancelled was 7,448,544; cancelled shares are related to share buyback in the current and the previous year (2021: 9,247,849). For further details on weighted average number of shares, refer to Note 10.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNone of the non-controlling interests are considered individually material to the group. The effects of share transactions with non-controlling interest shareholders are recorded in equity insofar these do not lead to changes in control.",

        "page_content": "## Note 19 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PROVISIONS\n\nPost-retirement benefit provisions relate to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including healthcare or welfare plans. The largest defined benefit pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme (CPS) in the UK which together account for 86% of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 90% of plan assets. Other pension plans include among others the largely unfunded plans in Germany, the plans in the US and certain other smaller plans in the UK. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries of establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands.\n\nValuations of the obligations under the plans are carried out regularly by independent qualified actuaries. We accrue for the expected costs of providing such post-retirement benefits during the service years of the employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility of the Executive Committee Pensions. This committee provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans including oversight of the impact of the plans on the company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the balance sheet. The committee develops and maintains policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and assumption setting.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nAlmost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members since the early to mid-2000s, although in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the US, benefit accrual is frozen and employees participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where plans are closed, new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement. In countries in high growth markets, pension schemes currently are not material. Unless mandated by law, it is our policy that any new plans are established as defined contribution plans.\n\nThe most significant risks that we run in relation to defined benefit plans are investment returns falling short of expectations, low discount rates, inflation exceeding expectations, retirees living longer than expected and\n\nlegislation changes. The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are held outside of the company in a trust or a foundation, which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees, depending on the legal arrangements in the country concerned. The primary objective with regards to the investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that each individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy future benefit obligations in accordance with local legal and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop investment strategies. Studies are carried out periodically to analyze and understand the trade-off between expected investment returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact on cash contributions. We aim to strike a cautious balance between these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.\n\nPlan assets principally consist of insurance (annuity) policies, long-term interest-earning investments and (investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity securities. Our largest plans use derivatives (such as index futures, currency forward contracts and swaps) to reduce volatility of underlying variables, for efficient portfolio management and to improve the liability matching characteristics of the assets. Limits have been set on the use of derivatives which are periodically subject to review for compliance with the pension fund's investment strategy.\n\nIn line with our proactive pension risk management strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans over time. We evaluate potential de-risking opportunities on an ongoing basis. Future de-risking transactions may have both cash flow and balance sheet impacts which may be substantial, as had some of the de-risking actions already taken. The cost of fully removing risk would exceed estimated funding deficits.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2022, ICIPF and a smaller UK plan, the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund (ISCPF), have invested in annuity buy-in contracts that aim to hedge all key risks related to their pensioner populations.\n\nIn October 2022, the Trustee of the ICIPF entered into a further annuity buy-in agreement with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited. It covers, in aggregate, \u00a354 million (\u20ac62 million) of pensioner liabilities (insurer valuation). The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity\n\npolicy under which the insurer will pay to ICIPF amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to members who have recently become pensioners. The pension liabilities remain with, and the matching annuity policies are held within, ICIPF. The accounting impact of the transaction is a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in other comprehensive income of \u00a312 million (\u20ac14 million).\n\nIn November 2022, the Trustee of the CPS entered into its first annuity buy-in agreement with Phoenix Life Limited. It covers, in aggregate, \u00a3640 million (\u20ac724 million) of pensioner liabilities (insurer valuation). The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy under which the insurer will pay to CPS amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to a section of its pensioners. The pension liabilities remain with, and the matching annuity policies are held within, CPS. The accounting impact of the transaction is a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in other comprehensive income of \u00a354 million (\u20ac62 million).\n\nBy purchasing bulk annuities, the ICIPF, CPS and ISCPF Trustees have taken significant steps in actively de-risking liabilities and reducing the risk that AkzoNobel will be required to contribute additional cash in the future.\n\nCPS also has an insurance contract to hedge longevity risk in respect of a portion of its pensioners not impacted by the recent buy-in transaction.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, correspondence between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) was published regarding the future of the Retail Price Index (RPI) measurement of inflation. With effect from February 2030 onwards, increases in the RPI will be aligned with those under the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) with owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH). Broadly this is expected to result in RPI inflation being 1% lower in the longer term than under the existing methodology. The inflation assumption continues to be calculated using a market breakeven inflation rate and the CPI inflation assumption, on which the benefits of some plans are based, is set with reference to RPI. Until 2030, the CPI inflation assumption is calculated as 1% below RPI and from 2030 onwards as 0.1% below RPI.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, a court ruling resulted in a \u00a320 million (\u20ac23 million) past service credit in one of the UK's pension plans, the J.P.

As AkzoNobel does not have access to sufficient information from Alecta to enable defined benefit accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Contributions in 2022 were \u20ac2 million (2021: \u20ac2 million). Alecta's funding ratio is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 175%. The most recently quoted ratio at December 2022 stood at 172%.\n\nThe expenses of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans in AkzoNobel totaled \u20ac89 million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac83 million).\n\n## DBO at funded and unfunded pension plans*\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Wholly or partly funded plans   | 14,005 | 9,229  |\n| Unfunded plans                  | 179    | 246    |\n| Total                           | 14,184 | 9,475  |\n\n## Other post-retirement benefit plans\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands. The risks to which the US healthcare plans expose AkzoNobel include the risk of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of maintaining the plans. The benefit payments to retirees under the Dutch plan are frozen. Both plans expose AkzoNobel to the risk of a decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.\n\n## Reconciliation balance sheet\n\nThe closing net balance sheet position of \u20ac602 million (2021: \u20ac1,017 million) includes the pension plans (\u20ac709 million net asset; 2021: \u20ac1,143 million net asset) and other post-retirement plans (\u20ac107 million liability; 2021: \u20ac126 million liability).\n\n## Administrative expenses\n\nIn addition to the expenses borne by the funds themselves, some expenses are borne directly by AkzoNobel.

In addition, we directly incurred asset management expenses of \u20ac2 million (2021: \u20ac3 million), which have been included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Interest costs\n\nInterest costs on the DBO for both pensions and other post-retirement benefits, together with the interest income on plan assets, comprise the financing income related to post-retirement benefits of \u20ac18 million (2021: \u20ac13 million), refer to Note 8.\n\n## Pension plans in asset position\n\nPension balances recorded under Financial non-current assets totaled \u20ac1,029 million (2021: \u20ac1,638 million). The decrease in 2022 is due to \u20ac556 million of net actuarial losses and \u20ac89 million of exchange rate translation losses, partially offset by \u20ac21 million of employer contributions and net income of \u20ac15 million, in the relevant plans.\n\nThese assets could be recognized under IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, either during the life of the plan or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe equities and government bond debt assets have quoted prices in active markets, although most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves. The total value of plan assets not quoted in active markets is \u20ac6,666 million (2021: \u20ac8,420 million), including the UK buy-in annuity policies totaling \u20ac6,078 million (2021: \u20ac7,698 million), investments in real estate totaling \u20ac343 million (2021: \u20ac469 million) and other investments in infrastructure and insurance policies. The UK buy-in annuity policies have a value that is equal to the DBO of the pensioners covered by the policies.\n\nPlan assets did not directly include any of AkzoNobel's own transferable financial instruments, nor any property occupied by or assets used by the company.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nIn 2023, we expect to contribute \u20ac49 million (2022: \u20ac56 million) to our defined benefit pension plans.

This table illustrates the overall impact on DBO for the changes shown, which management assessed could be reasonably possible over a longer term from a sensitivity test perspective. It should be noted, however, that this analysis does\n\nnot indicate and probability of such changes occurring, not does it preclude larger changes in any given period or longer term. In addition, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the total DBO. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results, in principle, cannot be extrapolated due to increasing non-",

Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-retirement defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan asset changes rather than DBO changes.\n\nThe sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet. Movements in the fair value of plan assets (which include the de-risking instruments) would, to a significant extent, be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions.\n\nAt ICIPF, the annuity buy-in contracts cover 99% of pensioner liabilities (2021: 99%) and 88% of total liabilities (2021: 84%).\n\nAt CPS, the annuity buy-in contract covers 42% of pensioner liabilities (2021: 0%) and 28% of total liabilities (2021: 0%).

translation using the December 31, 2022, exchange rate, unless indicated otherwise.\n- 2 Based on local valuation regulations.\n- 3 Actual rate at time of transfer.\n\n## Note 20 OTHER PROVISIONS AND AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n## General\n\nProvisions are recognized when an outflow of economic benefits for settlement is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. It should be understood that, in light of possible future developments, such as: (a) potential additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c) rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits, certain cases may result in additional liabilities and related costs. At this point in time, we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts with sufficient certainty to allow such amount or range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome of said cases, claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and information received, that the final outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.\n\n## Provisions for restructuring of activities\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities comprise of accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities. For all restructuring provisions, a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan has been announced before the balance sheet date. Most restructuring plans are expected to be completed within one year from the balance sheet date.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nWe are confronted with costs arising out of environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to eliminate or limit the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes or substances at various sites. Proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are pending against us in various countries. In some cases, this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past.\n\nThe provision has been discounted using an average pre-tax discount rate of 3.8% (2021: 1.0%).",

The majority of the cash outflows related to liabilities to (former) employees is expected to be after five years. In calculating the liabilities to (former) employees, a pre-tax discount rate of on average 5.0% (2021: 1.5%) has been used.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\nSundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions, including provisions for (customer) claims, sales returns, guarantees and other operational provisions. The majority of the cash outflows related to sundry provisions is expected to be within one to five years. In calculating the sundry provisions, a pre-tax discount rate of on average 5.3% (2021: 1.0%) has been used.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nEstimating the impact of environmental liabilities often is complex and requires significant judgement. It requires the assessment of many (often interconnected) elements, which contain varying levels of uncertainty. Environmental liabilities can change substantially, among others due to the emergence of additional information on the nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, changes in (the interpretation and enforcement of) environmental regulations, new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques, success or lack of success of currently\n\nanticipated clean-up methods, actions by governmental agencies or private parties, success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors, and/or other factors.\n\nEspecially for some sites for which we are faced with relatively new legislation, which are in the early stages of discussions with regulators, and/or where there is limited information available from earlier experience, there may be considerable variability between the clean-up activities that are currently being undertaken or planned and the ultimate actions that could be required. For such sites, the costs for the earlier years might be rather reliably estimable, whilst for later years it is much more difficult, if possible at all, to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation. If the level of uncertainty is such that no reliable estimate can be made for the longer-term costs, no provision for such costs is recorded. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future (changes to) provisions for environmental costs which, in management's opinion, based on information currently available, would not have a material effect on the company's financial position but could be material to the company's results of operations in any one accounting period.\n\nA number of claims against AkzoNobel are pending, many of which are contested. We are also involved in legal disputes and disputes with tax authorities in several jurisdictions. AkzoNobel has provided various indemnities and guarantees in respect of past divestments to the relevant purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable), which in general are capped in time and/or amount (in proportion to the value received). The provided guarantees and indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel has received various claims under such indemnities and guarantees. In some instances, AkzoNobel has been named as a direct defendant despite the divestments.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and AkzoNobel, Nouryon and Nobian continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\n## Current portion of provisions\n\nThe current portion of post-retirement benefit provisions (\u20ac40 million) and the current portion of other provisions (\u20ac126 million) add up to \u20ac166 million (2021: \u20ac149 million), as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe discount rates used in calculating the provisions recognized at December 31, 2022 are mentioned in the paragraphs on provisions for environmental costs, liabilities to (former) employees and sundry provisions. Changes in discount rates will affect our consolidated financial position. A sensitivity test showed that a one percentage point increase or decrease of discount rates will have an impact down or up, respectively, of \u20ac6 million on the provisions recognized at December 31, 2022.",

These risks are inherent to the way we operate as a multinational with a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall risk management program seeks to identify, assess, and - if necessary and possible - mitigate these financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance.\n\nOur risk mitigating activities include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Board of Management is ultimately responsible for risk management. We centrally identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks, and monitor compliance with the corporate policies approved by the Board of Management, except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the businesses. Next to our centralized Treasury organization in Amsterdam, we have treasury hubs located in Brazil and China that are primarily responsible for regional cash management and short-term financing. We do not allow extensive treasury operations directly with external parties at subsidiary level.\n\n## Maturity of liabilities and cash outflows\n\n| In \u20ac millions            | Less than  1 year   | Between  1 and 5 years   | Over 5  years   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| At December 31, 2021     |                     |                          |                 |\n| Borrowings               | 1,469               | 1,006                    | 776             |\n| Interest on borrowings   | 60                  | 134                      | 40              |\n| Lease liabilities        | 87                  | 165                      | 47              |\n| Trade and other payables | 2,921               | -                        | -               |\n| FX contracts (hedges)    |                     |                          |                 |\n| Outflow                  | 2,819               | -                        | -               |\n| Inflow                   | (2,806)             | -                        | -               |\n| Total                    | 4,550               | 1,305                    | 863             |\n| At December 31, 2022     |                     |                          |                 |\n| Borrowings               | 2,457               | 1,172                    | 1,962           |\n| Interest on borrowings   | 118                 | 197                      | 84              |\n| Lease liabilities        | 86                  | 153                      | 45              |\n| Trade and other payables | 2,741               | -                        | -               |\n| FX contracts (hedges)    |                     |                          |                 |\n| Outflow                  | 3,097               | -                        | -               |\n| Inflow                   | (3,055)             | -                        | -               |\n| Total                    | 5,444               | 1,522                    | 2,091           |\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment obligations. We aim for a well-spread maturity schedule of our long-term borrowings and a strong liquidity position. At year-end 2022, we had \u20ac1.5 billion available as cash and cash equivalents (2021: \u20ac1.2 billion) and \u20ac336 million available as short-term investments (2021: \u20ac58 million), refer to Note 21.\n\nIn addition, we have a multi-currency revolving credit facility of \u20ac1.3 billion which runs until 2026. This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or on other material adverse changes. At year-end 2022 and 2021, this facility had not been drawn. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used.",

        "page_content": "We had \u20ac1.3 billion commercial paper outstanding at year end 2022 (2021: \u20ac371 million) against an average interest rate of 1.6% (2021: average interest rate of 0.5% negative). Further, at year-end 2022, we had \u20ac1.1 billion short-term bank loans outstanding (2021: \u20ac300 million) against 3-months Euribor plus a mark-up (2021: interest rate of 0.6% negative). None of these facilities contain financial covenants. The table on maturity of liabilities and cash outflows in this Note shows our cash outflows per maturity group. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. We have a credit risk management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with financial counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating. Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered into with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and a good reputation. Derivative transactions are concluded mostly with parties with whom we have contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in place. We set limits per counterparty for the different types of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the acceptable financial counterparty credit ratings and credit limits and revise where required in line with the market circumstances. We do not expect non-performance by the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to our geographical spread and the diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration of credit risks at balance sheet date.\n\nThe credit risk from trade receivables is measured and analyzed by dedicated teams in the businesses, mainly by means of ageing analysis, refer to Note 17. Additionally, trade receivables and financial assets measured at amortized cost are subject to the expected credit loss impairment model either using the general or the simplified\n\napproach. For more information on the applied impairment approaches per financial asset type, refer to Note 1.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\nAt year-end 2022, the credit risk on consolidated level was \u20ac4.6 billion (2021: \u20ac3.9 billion) for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans, trade and other receivables. Our credit risk is well spread among both global and local counterparties. Our largest counterparty risk amounted to \u20ac280 million at year-end 2022 (2021: \u20ac301 million).\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Trade and financing transactions\n\nWe operate in a large number of countries, where we have clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside of the local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposures which are partly netted out on group level. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange rate exposures above predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting is generally not applied for foreign currency hedging activities, except for certain specific forecasted transactions. In 2022 and 2021, we applied cash flow hedge accounting on a COP 1,600 billion hedge of the foreign currency risk related to the acquisition of Grupo Orbis which was finalized in April 2022. The hedges matured in April 2022. The fair value of the cash flow hedge of \u20ac31 million (positive) has subsequently been released from other comprehensive income and allocated to the purchase consideration. The hedges were fully effective during 2022 and 2021. In 2022, cash flow hedge accounting was applied on a $450 million hedge for foreign currency risk exposure related to the intended acquisition of Kansai Paint's African activities, refer to Note 2 for further details. The fair value of this hedge at year-end 2022 was \u20ac37 million negative; the spot result related to this hedge was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge\n\n## Hedged notional amounts at year-end\n\n| In \u20ac millions   | Buy 2021   | Sell 2021   | Buy 2022   | Sell 2022   |\n|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| US dollar       | 263        | 413         | 784        | 692         |\n| Pound sterling  | 601        | 45          | 649        | 10          |\n| Chinese yuan    | 179        | 145         | 110        | 157         |\n| Colombian peso  | 348        | 1           | -          | 1           |\n| Other*          | 391        | 745         | 278        | 821         |\n| Total           | 1,782      | 1,349       | 1,821      | 1,681       |\n\nreserve. The hedge will mature in the course of 2023. During 2022, the hedge was fully effective.\n\nIn general, our forward exchange contracts have a maturity of less than one year. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity. Currency derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.\n\n## Investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, net investment hedge accounting was applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign operations, which were partly hedged. The main net investments that were hedged with forward exchange contracts for the same currencies were related to Chinese yuan, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee (2021: Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, Indonesian rupiah and Vietnamese dong). The spot results related to these hedges were recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. In addition, a net investment in Colombian peso was hedged with a COP 330 million bank loan. The spot result related to this hedge was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. At year-end 2022, the hedge of net investment in Colombian peso was outstanding. During 2022 and 2021, the hedges of net investments were fully effective.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe are partly financed with debt in order to obtain more efficient leverage. Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest rate risk. We treat fixed rate debt maturing within one year",

        "page_content": "as floating rate debt for debt portfolio purposes. At the end of 2022, the fixed/floating ratio of our outstanding bonds was 100 percent fixed (2021: 70 percent fixed). During 2022 and 2021, we have not used any interest rate derivatives.\n\nIBOR reform refers to the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBOR) with alternative benchmark rates. Our long-term borrowings have fixed interest rates and we currently do not have any interest related hedging instruments. Fallback language has been added to our contracts while preparing for the transition to new rates. Based on this and following an internal assessment of the impact of the IBOR reform, we conclude that the interest rate benchmark reform does not have a material impact on the company's financial statements.\n\n## CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers and to maintain a capital structure that optimizes our cost of capital. For this we maintain an adequate financial strategy, with the objective to retain a strong investment grade credit rating as assigned by the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The capital structure can be altered, among others, by adjusting the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return of capital to capital providers, or issuance of new debt or shares. In March 2022, two bonds were issued with nominal values of \u20ac600 million each of which one at a coupon rate of 1.5%, maturing in 2028 and one at a coupon rate of 2.0%, maturing in 2032. In July 2022, a bond of \u20ac750 million matured.\n\nConsistent with other companies in the industry, we monitor capital headroom based on the leverage ratio net debt/EBITDA, for which we have set a target range of around 2. The ratio was 3.8 at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 1.6). EBITDA is operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, which amounted to \u20ac1,076 million for 2022 (2021: \u20ac1,469 million). Net debt is calculated as the total of long- and short-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, amounting to \u20ac4,089 million at year end 2022 (year end 2021: \u20ac2,340 million).\n\n## Fair value per financial instrument category\n\n## Carrying value per IFRS 9\n\ncategory\n\n| In \u20ac millions                  | Carrying  amount   | Out of scope   of IFRS 7 1   | Measured at  amortized  cost   | Measured  at fair value  through profit  or loss   | Total   carrying value   | Fair value  of items  measured at  amortized cost   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021 year-end                  |                    |                              |                                |                                                    |                          |                                                     |\n| Financial non-current assets 2 | 2,076              | 1,766                        | 302                            | 8                                                  | 310                      | 330                                                 |\n| Trade and other receivables 3  | 2,339              | 182                          | 2,089                          | 68                                                 | 2,157                    | 2,089                                               |\n| Short-term investments         | 58                 | -

The total carrying value is based on the accounting principles as outlined in Note 1. Financial instruments are recognized at fair value and subsequently recognized either at fair value or at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. The financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are derivative financial instruments\n\nand securities included in financial non-current assets, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The remaining financial instruments are accounted for at amortized cost.\n\nThe following valuation methods for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are distinguished:\n\n- \u00b7  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,",

The estimate is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt with similar maturities.\n- \u00b7  A level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of marketable securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by obtaining the market price at reporting date. The fair value of foreign currency contracts and swap contracts was determined by level 2 valuation techniques using market observable input (such as foreign currency interest rates based on Reuters) and by obtaining\n\nquotes from dealers and brokers. A level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of time deposits included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments using the market interest rate. The carrying amounts of cash and banks, trade receivables less allowance for impairment, other shortterm borrowings and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity period of those instruments and were determined using level 2 fair value methods.\n\n- \u00b7  A level 3 fair valuation method (discounted cash flow) was used for the subordinated loan granted to the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands, resulting in a fair value of \u20ac93 million.\n\n## MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS\n\nWe enter into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements.

        "page_content": "## Note A  GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a company headquartered in the Netherlands. The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809.\n\nThe financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, making use of the option of Article 362 of the Code, meaning that the accounting principles used are the same as for the Consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency amounts have been translated, assets and liabilities have been valued, and net income has been determined in accordance with the principles of valuation and determination of income presented in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor the Company financial statements, revenue is generated through service contracts with third parties.\n\nConsolidated subsidiaries are all entities (including intermediate subsidiaries) over which the company has control. The company controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are recognized from the date on which control is transferred to the company or its intermediate holding entities. They are derecognized from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe company applies the acquisition method to account for acquiring subsidiaries. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred by the company, liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the company. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, and are subsumed in the net asset value of the investment in consolidated subsidiaries. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nInvestments in consolidated subsidiaries are measured using the equity method, based on the measurement of assets, provisions and liabilities and determination of profit based on the principles applied in the consolidated financial statements. When an acquisition of an investment in\n\na consolidated subsidiary is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value on the date of acquisition. The remeasurement against the book value is accounted for in the statement of income. When the company ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount to be accounted for in the statement of income.\n\nWhen parts of investments in consolidated subsidiaries are bought or sold, and such transaction does not result in the loss of control, the difference between the consideration paid or received and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired or sold, is directly recognized in equity.\n\nThe remuneration paragraph is included in Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements. The number of employees having a contract with the Company at year-end 2022 was 7 (2021: 7). All employees are based in the Netherlands.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is head of the Dutch fiscal unity for corporate income tax. Members of the fiscal unity reflect taxes in their accounts on the basis as if they are taxable on a standalone basis and are charged or credited accordingly by the company.\n\n## Note B  FINANCING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nOther items in 2022 and 2021 mainly include foreign currency results.\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\n| In \u20ac millions                         | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing income - third parties      | 2      | 5      |\n| Financing income - subsidiaries       | 77     | 53     |\n| Financing expense - third parties     | (94)   | (75)   |\n| Financing expense - subsidiaries      | (6)    | (39)   |\n| Net Interest on net debt              | (21)   | (56)   |\n| Other items                           | (4)    | (15)   |\n| Net other financing income/(expenses) | (4)    | (15)   |\n| Total                                 | (25)   | (71)   |\n\n## Note C  INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets mainly include (internally developed) software.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n| In \u20ac millions                              | Other intangibles   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2021                 |                     |\n| Cost of (internally developed) intangibles | 82                  |\n| Accumulated amortization                   | (11)                |\n| Carrying value at January 1, 2021          | 71                  |\n| Movements in 2021                          |                     |\n| Additions                                  | 31                  |\n| Amortization                               | (11)                |\n| Total movements                            | 20                  |\n| Cost of (internally developed) intangibles | 113                 |\n| Accumulated amortization                   | (22)                |\n| Balance at December 31, 2021               | 91                  |\n| Movements in 2022                          |                     |\n| Additions                                  | 26                  |\n| Amortization                               | (18)                |\n| Total movements                            | 8                   |\n| Cost of (internally developed) intangibles | 139                 |\n| Accumulated amortization                   | (40)                |\n| Balance at December 31, 2022               | 99                  |",

The fair value of the loans to subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\nDue to an intra-group funding restructuring, several intercompany loans were transferred in 2021 from certain foreign subsidiaries to Akzo Nobel N.V..\n\nLoans to subsidiaries that will mature in 2023 amounted to \u20ac262 million, an amount of \u20ac1,738 million will mature\n\nbetween 2024 and 2027 and an amount of \u20ac84 million after 2027. The remainder of the loans to subsidiaries has no fixed repayment schedule.\n\nOther non-current assets include the subordinated loan granted to the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands. Using a level 3 fair valuation method (discounted cash flow), a fair value of \u20ac93 million was determined for this loan. For information on valuation methods, see Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Short-term receivables\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   |   2021 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Receivables from subsidiaries   |    133 |    202 |\n| FX contracts                    |     14 |     18 |\n| Other receivables               |      7 |      3 |\n| Total                           |    154 |    223 |\n\nShort-term receivables are expected to be settled within one year. Receivables from subsidiaries include interest to be received on intercompany loans of \u20ac17 million (2021: \u20ac10 million). The fair value of the receivables from subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\n## Note F SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nThe holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. The holders of the priority shares are entitled to a dividend of 6% per share or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. They are entitled to 800 votes per share (in accordance with the 800 times higher nominal value per share) at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. In addition, the holders of priority shares have the right to draw up binding lists of nominees for appointment to the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management; amendments to the Articles of Association are subject to the approval of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares.\n\nPriority shares may only be transferred to a transferee designated by a Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares and against payment of the par value of the shares, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, for the period between the beginning of the year and the date of transfer. There are no restrictions on voting rights of holders of common or priority shares. The Articles of Association set out procedures for exercising voting rights. The Annual General Meeting of shareholders has resolved in 2022 to authorize the Board of Management for a period of 18 months (i) to issue shares (or grant rights to shares) in the capital of the company up to a maximum of 10% of",

The issue or repurchase of shares requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nOn February 16, 2021, a \u20ac1 billion share buyback program was announced, which was completed in January 2022. All shares bought back under this program were cancelled.\n\nIn February 2022, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced, which was completed in 2022. As at December 31, 2022, a total of 7.3 million shares had been acquired under this program, of which 3.3 million were cancelled.\n\nOf the shareholders' equity of \u20ac4.3 billion (2021: \u20ac5.4 billion), \u20ac4.0 billion (2021: \u20ac5.1 billion) was unrestricted and available for distribution, subject to the relevant provisions of our Articles of Association and Dutch law.\n\nDuring 2022, 8,651,230 common shares were repurchased (2021: 11,296,283 shares repurchased). The total amount of shares cancelled was 7,448,544; cancelled shares related to share buybacks in the current and the previous year (2021: 9,247,849 shares cancelled).

We propose a 2022 final dividend of \u20ac1.54 (2021: \u20ac1.54) per common share, which would equal a total 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.98 (2021: \u20ac1.98).\n\n## Note G  NET DEBT\n\n## Analysis of net debt by category\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31             | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bonds issued                              | 1,740  | 2,934  |\n| Debt from subsidiaries*                   | 4,485  | 4,168  |\n| Long-term borrowings                      | 6,225  | 7,102  |\n| Current portion of long-term   borrowings | 749    | -      |\n| Debt to credit institutions               | 672    | 2,399  |\n| Other                                     | 4      | 4      |\n| Short-term borrowings                     | 1,425  | 2,403  |\n| Total borrowings                          | 7,650  | 9,505  |\n| Short-term investments                    | -      | (290)  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | (404)  | (643)  |\n| Net debt                                  | 7,246  | 8,572  |\n\n- *  Part of the debt from subsidiaries has no fixed repayment schedule. The fair value of the debt from subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\n## Multi-currency revolving credit facility\n\nWe have a multi-currency revolving credit facility of \u20ac1.3 billion which runs until 2026. This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or material adverse change. At year-end 2022 and 2021, this facility has not been drawn.\n\n## Long-term borrowings\n\nFor the fair value of the bonds issued, refer to Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements. We estimated the fair value of the bonds issued based on the quoted market prices (level 1) for the same or similar issues or on the\n\ncurrent rates offered to us for debt with similar maturities. At year-end 2022, the fair value of the bonds included in longterm borrowings was \u20ac2,633 million (2021: \u20ac2,624 million).\n\n## Bonds issued\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1 3/4% 2014/24 (\u20ac500 million)   | 499    | 499    |\n| 1 1/8% 2016/26 (\u20ac500 million)   | 497    | 498    |\n| 1 5/8% 2020/30 (\u20ac750 million)   | 744    | 745    |\n| 1 1/2% 2022/28 (\u20ac600 million)   | -      | 595    |\n| 2% 2022/32 (\u20ac600 million)       | -      | 597    |\n| Total                           | 1,740  | 2,934  |\n\nIn March 2022, two bonds were issued with nominal values of \u20ac600 million each, of which one at a coupon rate of 1.5%, maturing in 2028 and one at a coupon rate of 2.0%, maturing in 2032.\n\nAt year-end 2022 and 2021, none of the borrowings was secured by collateral.\n\nIn 2023, an amount of \u20ac125 million of debt from subsidiaries will mature; a further amount of \u20ac100 million will mature between 2024 and 2027. The remainder of the loans from subsidiaries has no fixed repayment schedule.\n\n## Short-term borrowings\n\nFor the fair value of the debt to credit institutions, refer to Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe current portion of long-term borrowings decreased mainly due to the maturing of a \u20ac750 million bond in July 2022.\n\nDebt to credit institutions includes our commercial paper program. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used. We had \u20ac1.3 billion commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2022 (2021: \u20ac371 million) against an average interest rate of 1.6% (2021: 0.5% negative). At year-end 2022, we had shortterm bank loans outstanding of \u20ac1.1 billion (2021: \u20ac300 million) against a 3-months Euribor plus a mark-up (2021: interest rate of 0.6% negative). None of these facilities contain financial covenants.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments almost entirely consist of time deposits, money market funds and marketable securities with a lifetime at investment date longer than three months but shorter than twelve months. At year-end 2022, we had short-term investments outstanding for an amount of \u20ac290 million (2021: \u20acnil).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nDeposits and money market funds within cash and cash equivalents almost entirely consist of time deposits immediately convertible into known amounts of cash and with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase and marketable securities that can be redeemed immediately when called.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31                                            |   2021 |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash on hand and in banks                                                |    304 |    293 |\n| Deposits and money markets funds  with a maturity less than three months |    100 |    350 |\n| Included in cash and cash equiva- lents in the balance sheet             |    404 |    643 |\n\n## Note H  OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\n\n## Other current liabilities\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   |   2021 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Payables to subsidiairies*      |     30 |     23 |\n| FX contracts                    |     27 |     60 |\n| Other suppliers                 |      1 |      2 |\n| Interest payable                |     22 |     33 |\n| Other liabilities               |     17 |      3 |\n| Total                           |     97 |    121 |\n\n- * The fair value of the payables to subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\nOther current liabilities are expected to fall due in less than one year.",

The contracts mainly relate to US dollars, pound sterling and Chinese Yuan, and all have maturities within one year. These contracts offset the foreign exchange contracts concluded with the subsidiaries, and the fair value changes are recognized in the statement of income to offset the fair value changes on the contracts with the subsidiaries, or recognized in other comprehensive income in case hedge accounting is applied. For information on risk exposure and risk management, see Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note J CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is parent of the group's fiscal unity in the Netherlands, and is therefore liable for the liabilities of said fiscal unity as a whole.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has declared in writing that it accepts joint and several liability for contractual debts of certain Dutch and Irish consolidated companies (Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and section 357(1) of the Irish Companies Act 2014). These debts, at year-end 2022, aggregating \u20ac0.6 billion (2021: \u20ac0.5 billion), are included in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and AkzoNobel, Nouryon and Nobian continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\nAdditionally, at year-end 2022, guarantees were issued on behalf of consolidated companies for an amount of \u20ac0.4 billion (2021: \u20ac0.3 billion). The debts and liabilities of the consolidated companies underlying these guarantees are included in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note K  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S FEES\n\nOur independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V., has rendered, for the period to which the audit of the financial statements relates, in addition to the audit of the statutory financial statements, mainly statutory audits of controlled entities.\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n## Accountants N.V.\n\n| In \u20ac millions                      | In the   Netherlands   | Network  outside the  Netherlands   | 2022 Total   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Audit of the financial  statements | 3.7                    | 5.5                                 | 9.2          |\n| Other audit services               | 0.3                    | 0.1                                 | 0.4          |\n| Tax services                       | -                      | -                                   | -            |\n| Other non-audit  services          | -                      | -                                   | -            |\n| Total                              | 4.0                    | 5.6                                 | 9.6          |\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nAccountants N.V.\n\n## 2021\n\n| In \u20ac millions                      | In the   Netherlands   | Network  outside the  Netherlands   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Audit of the financial  statements | 4.1                    | 4.3                                 | 8.4     |\n| Other audit services               | 0.2                    | 0.1                                 | 0.3     |\n| Tax services                       | -                      | -                                   | -       |\n| Other non-audit  services          | -                      | -                                   | -       |\n| Total                              | 4.3                    | 4.4                                 | 8.7     |\n\nAmsterdam, February 27, 2023\n\n## The Board of Management\n\nGreg Poux-Guillaume\n\nMaarten de Vries\n\n## The Supervisory Board\n\nNils Smedegaard Andersen\n\nEster Baiget Jolanda Poots-Bijl Hans Van Bylen Byron Grote Pamela Kirby Dick Sluimers Patrick Thomas",

The financial statements comprise the Consolidated financial statements of the group and the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The Consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2022\n- \u00b7   The following statements for 2022: the Consolidated statement of income, the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows\n- \u00b7   The notes, comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe Company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The Balance sheet as at December 31, 2022\n- \u00b7  The Statement of income for the year then ended\n- \u00b7  The notes, comprising a summary of the accounting policies applied and other explanatory information\n\nThe financial reporting framework applied in the preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Consolidated financial statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Company financial statements.\n\n## The basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with the European Union 'Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities', the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe designed our audit procedures with respect to the key audit matters, fraud and going concern, and the matters resulting from that, in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The information in support of our opinion, such as our findings and observations related to individual key audit matters, the audit approach fraud risks and the audit approach going concern was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Overview and context\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a global paints and coatings company headquartered in the Netherlands and with operations in over 150 countries. Our group audit scope and approach are set out in the section 'The scope of our group audit'.\n\nIn our audit we paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the group, as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Board of Management made important judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, the company describes areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. We considered the valuation of the post-retirement benefit provisions and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be key audit matters as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report, given the significant estimation uncertainty, the judgmental nature and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement. In addition, we paid attention to, amongst others, the assumptions underlying the physical and transition risk related to climate change.\n\nThe company executed over the past years a wide range of transformational projects. These projects continued in 2022, with the goal to align to the company's evolving operating model, focusing on end-to-end processes and to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness. Inherently, transformation processes encompass changes in the organization, systems, processes and controls.\n\nWe therefore evaluated the impact of the transformation on our audit. Due to the significance of the ongoing transformation to the company and the extended audit procedures, we included 'Ongoing transformation of the organization, systems, processes and controls' as a key audit matter, as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report.\n\nGlobal events during 2022 caused cost inflation, challenged supply chains, dented consumer confidence and weakened market demand. The Russian military invasion of Ukraine and resulting government sanctions impacted the wider economy, especially Europe. China's zero COVID-19 policy and resulting government restrictions put pressure on demand in this market and on sourcing of raw materials from China. These events in combination had an adverse impact on the company's results of operations.",

        "page_content": "We considered the impact of these global geo-political and macro-economic developments on our audit approach, including our scoping, materiality and risk assessment. The impact of these developments on our materiality assessment is further explained in the section 'Materiality'. Furthermore, we assessed the impact on significant management accounting judgments, including inventory valuation, and future business and cash flow projections underpinning impairment assessments, deferred tax asset recoverability, key assumptions used in the valuation of post retirement benefit provisions, and the going concern assumption. We concluded the impact of the geo-political and macro-economic developments on the company's results of operations to be an area of focus but was not considered as a separate key audit matter.\n\nClimate change is an area of key interest to a wide group of stakeholders. Akzo Nobel N.V. assessed the potential effects of climate change and their plans to meet the company's announced emissions reduction commitments. The company considered, amongst others, physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events, as well as transitional risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. Management also assessed the resulting impact on the financial position, including underlying assumptions and estimates. As part of our audit risk assessment, we gained an understanding of the company's strategy and sustainability targets, evaluated the potential impact on the financial statements and discussed the assessment and governance thereof with management. We concluded the impact of climate change to be an area of focus that is not considered a key audit matter.\n\nOther areas of focus that we do not consider to be key audit matters were related to the impairment testing of goodwill and brands with indefinite useful lives, testing of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Colombia-based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis S.A. (Grupo Orbis), testing of valuation of the other provisions and information technology general controls (ITGCs).\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of the group. We therefore included in our team experts in the areas of pensions, share-based payments and valuations and specialists in the areas of tax, IT and treasury.\n\nThe outline of our audit approach was as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7   Overall materiality: \u20ac43.75 million (2021: \u20ac55 million)\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7  We conducted audit work at 49 components in 18 countries (2021: 49 components in 18 countries)\n- \u00b7   Site reviews were physically conducted to four countries (11 components) and virtually to three countries (17 components) (2021: virtually conducted to nine countries (39 components))\n- \u00b7   Audit coverage: 64% of consolidated revenue (2021: 64%), 72% of consolidated total assets (2021: 68%) and 67% of consolidated profit before tax (2021: 60%)\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7  Ongoing transformation of the organization, systems, processes and controls\n- \u00b7   Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions\n- \u00b7   Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.\n\nBased on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\n\n## Overall group materiality\n\n## Basis for determining materiality\n\n## Rationale for benchmark applied\n\n## Component materiality\n\n\u20ac43.75 million (2021: \u20ac55 million).\n\nWe used our professional judgment to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment, we used 5% of a three-year average of profit before tax, including the current year results.\n\nWe used profit before tax as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis, we believe that profit before tax is the most relevant metric for the financial performance of the company and is a metric widely used within the industry.\n\nWe applied a three-year average of profit before tax as outlined above. In prior years we applied currentyear profit before tax. The comparative year-on year decline of the company's profit before tax caused us to re-assess the appropriateness of a single year profitability for the current audit. In preparing this assessment, we have considered recent global geo-political and macro-economic developments, as described in the section 'Overview and context' and the impact thereof on the financial results of the company, as well as management's expectations and budget for the results in the upcoming years.\n\nApplying a multi-year average benchmark for materiality responds to adverse economic trends and volatility in profit before tax from year to year. On this basis we concluded that applying a three-year average is a more appropriate basis for the current year audit, and also better reflects the company's scale of operations for the year.\n\nFurthermore, we utilised a 5% threshold, based on our professional judgment, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds and the predominant threshold used for companies with similar characteristics.\n\nBased on our judgment, we allocate materiality to each component in our audit scope that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac43 million.\n\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac2 million (2021: \u20ac2 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",

        "page_content": "## The scope of our group audit\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities managed by the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The financial information of this group is included in the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit included 23 components which were subjected to audits of their complete financial information, selected on the basis of the relative size of their operations. None of the components are individually financially significant to the group. We further subjected 15 components to specific focused audit procedures on individual financial statement line items, such as revenue, cost of sales, inventories, trade and other receivables, post-retirement benefit provisions, tax, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, based on the relative size or related higher inherent risks of material misstatement. Additionally, we selected 11 components for audit procedures to achieve appropriate audit coverage on specific financial line items in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures, this resulted in the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n| Revenue           | 64%   |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Total assets      | 72%   |\n| Profit before tax | 67%   |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 1.5% of total group revenue, 1.5% of total group assets or 4.5% of profit before tax. For those remaining components we performed, amongst others, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within those components.\n\nFor all components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work. We collectively performed hard close audit procedures on the interim October balance sheet positions and results. These hard close audit procedures included substantive audit work on certain material balances and transactions. Roll-forward procedures and top-up testing were performed at year-end to cover the full-year period.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included, amongst others, our risk analysis, materiality and the scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams throughout the audit. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit matters identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters, that could be of relevance for the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe group engagement team attended physical or virtual site review meetings with a selection of the component teams and local management. During these meetings we discussed the strategy and financial performance of the local businesses, as well as the audit plan and execution, significant risks and other relevant audit topics. The most significant components are selected every year and other components are selected, depending on specific considerations which include, amongst others, audit observations, specific risks identified and other major events. In the current year, components in the following countries were selected: United States, China, Brazil, Germany, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of more complex items and processes\n\ncontrolled and monitored centrally by Akzo Nobel N.V. These include impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, testing of purchase price allocation for acquisitions of Grupo Orbis and the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH, share-based payments, valuation of deferred tax assets, group level other provisions and contingent liabilities, treasury, ITGCs and the Akzo Nobel N.V. Company financial statements.\n\nBy performing the procedures outlined above at the components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the group's financial information, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach fraud risks\n\nAs in all of our audits, we identified and assessed the risk of material misstatement to the financial statements due to fraud. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption.\n\nAs a starting point, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the elements of the system of internal control relating to fraud risks. We conducted interviews with members of the Board of Management, the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and others within the company, including the Internal Audit and Integrity and Compliance function, to obtain an understanding of the company's fraud risk assessment and the processes for identifying and responding to the risks of fraud and the internal control that management has established to mitigate these risks. Akzo Nobel N.V. has an integrity and compliance program, which includes a governance and organization structure, policies and procedures around risk management, policy management, communication, training and education, a competition law program, privacy program, anti-bribery and anti-corruption program, monitoring, grievance and investigation procedures, and reporting. We considered management's own risk assessment and response to the risks of fraud, management's monitoring of the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes thereof.",

        "page_content": "As described in the auditing standards, management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition are presumed risks of fraud.\n\nInherently, management of a company is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of its ability to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. The ongoing transformation of the organization, systems, processes and controls, which we consider a key audit matter, also increases, inherently, the risk of management override of internal controls. We addressed this risk of management override of controls, including evaluating journal entries, transactions outside the normal course of business and whether there was evidence of potential bias by management when making assumptions and estimates that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We evaluated journal entries by processing and reviewing postings with the support of data analytics. To address the assessed risks of significant transactions outside the normal course of business, we performed, amongst others, procedures over the acquisition of Grupo Orbis. The audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks of management bias include, among others, evaluation of the design and the implementation of internal controls that intend to mitigate fraud risks, and retrospective review of prior year's estimates. For examples of key assumptions and estimates, refer to the key audit matters 'Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions' and 'Valuation of deferred tax assets'.\n\nFurthermore, we, together with our forensic specialists, assessed matters reported through the group's SpeakUp! program and complaints procedures and results of management's investigation of such matters if deemed applicable, and discussed this with the Audit Committee.\n\nWith regard to the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, based on our risk assessment procedures, we concluded that this risk is related to the occurrence of revenue transactions, due to the company's strategy to continuously grow and expand market share. We performed procedures over this risk, including evaluation of the design and implementation of relevant internal controls, tracing a sample of revenue transactions to the supporting documents, and validating unusual journal entries.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. During the entire audit we remained alert to indications of fraud and considered the impact on our audit, if any. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non compliance.\n\n## Audit approach going concern\n\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, management performed their assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements and has not identified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern (hereafter: going concern risks). Our procedures to evaluate management's going concern assessment included, among others:\n\n- \u00b7   Considering whether management's going concern assessment includes relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit and inquiring with management regarding management's most important assumptions underlying its going concern assessment\n- \u00b7   Analyzing the financial position per balance sheet date, such as financial leverage and cash positions, in relation to the financial position per prior year balance sheet date to assess whether events or circumstances exist that may lead to a going concern risk, and liquidity management as disclosed in Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7   Evaluating management's current budget, including expected future cash flows in comparison with last year, market developments, developments in the macroeconomic environment, climate-related developments and the relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit, including, amongst others, the cash flow projection of the five-year plan obtained as part of the goodwill impairment testing\n- \u00b7   Performing inquiries of management as to their knowledge of going concern risks beyond the period of management's assessment\n\nOur procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to management's assumptions and judgments used in the application of the going concern assumption.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we describe the key audit matters and include a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.",

Our engagement has been renewed annually.\n\n## European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has prepared the annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report prepared in XHTML format, including the marked-up Consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting package by Akzo Nobel N.V., complies, in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Board of Management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion on whether the annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assuranceopdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting).\n\nOur examination included amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7   Obtaining an understanding of the company's financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package\n- \u00b7   Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:\n- -  Obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package, containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, have been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF\n- -  Examining the information related to the Consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF\n\n## No prohibited non-audit services\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in article 5(1) of the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.\n\n## Services rendered\n\nThe services, in addition to the audit, that we have provided to the company or its controlled entities, for the period to which our statutory audit relates, are disclosed in Note K to the financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7   The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n- \u00b7   Such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board of Management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Board of Management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.",

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high, but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nMateriality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nA more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.\n\nAmsterdam, February 27, 2023\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.\n\nOriginal has been signed by Fernand Izeboud RA\n\n## Appendix to our auditor's report on the financial statements 2022 of Akzo Nobel N.V.\n\nIn addition to what is included in our auditor's report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.\n\n## The auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, amongst others, of the following:\n\n- \u00b7   Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.\n- \u00b7   Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7   Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Management.\n- \u00b7   Concluding on the appropriateness of the Board of Management's use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7   Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the Consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

When this is the case, it is indicated in the annual report and in Akzo Nobel's Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2022.\n\n## The basis for our conclusion\n\nWe conducted our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standard 3000A Assurance engagements, other than audits or reviews of historical financial information (attestation-engagements). This engagement is aimed to provide limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the examination' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).\n\nPwC applies the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality systems) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Applicable criteria\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Indicators are Akzo Nobel's Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2022, developed by the Company, as disclosed in the 'Managing sustainability' paragraph of the annual report 2022 and further elaborated in the document 'Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2022', which was made",

The procedures performed in this context consisted primarily of making inquiries with officers of the entity and determining the plausibility of the Indicators and the information included in the Sustainability statements of the annual report 2022. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained, had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Procedures performed\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the examination in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence requirements.\n\nOur examination consisted, among other things, of the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures to the Indicators. This includes the evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Through inquiries, obtaining a general understanding of the control environment, processes, and information relevant to the preparation of the Indicators, but not for the purpose of obtaining assurance evidence about their implementation or testing their operating effectiveness\n- \u00b7  Identifying areas of the Indicators with a higher risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the Indicators responsive to this risk analysis. Those other procedures consisted among others of:\n- -  interviewing management (and/or relevant staff) at corporate level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results\n- -  interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data resulting in the Indicators\n- -  determining the nature and extent of the review procedures for locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these locations are decisive. Based thereon we selected the locations to visit, being Wapenveld, the Netherlands; Warsaw, the United States of America; and Montataire, France. Of these, one was a physical visit and two of were virtual. These visits are aimed at, on a local level, observing parts of Akzo Nobel's Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) audits and validating source data and obtaining through inquiries a general understanding of the control environment, processes and information relevant to the preparation of the Indicators\n- -  obtaining assurance evidence that the Indicators reconcile to underlying records of the Company\n- -  reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation\n- -  performing an analytical review of the data and trends of the Indicators submitted for consolidation at corporate level\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the consistency of the Indicators with the information in the annual report, which is not included in the scope of our review\n- \u00b7  To consider whether the Indicators as a whole, including the disclosures, reflect the purpose of the reporting criteria used\n\nWe communicated with the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the review and significant findings that we identified during our review.\n\nAmsterdam, February 27, 2023\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.\n\nOriginal has been signed by Fernand Izeboud RA",

In 2019, four quarterly surveys were held with results per quarter. For the annual report of 2019, the Q4 scores were reported.  Since 2020, frequency was changed to two (Q1 and Q3) survey. For 2022, we have decided to change the frequency to once a year. Therefore the reported results in the 2022 annual  report are from Q2, 2022. All permanent employees are part of the survey except for contingent workers, contractors, temporary or interns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Female executives                                                     | Percentage of women at executive level.

Non-reusable waste is waste which is not used for resource recovery,  recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or alternative uses (e.g. composting).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Circular use of materials                                           | The amount of materials reused by AkzoNobel and third parties (reusable waste plus by-products) divided by the total waste plus by-products (percentage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Hazardous waste                                                     | Hazardous waste is waste that is classified and regulated as such according to the national, state, provincial or local legislation in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Total waste to landfill                                             | All hazardous and non-hazardous non reusable waste (in absolute measures (kilotons) and kg per ton production) as it leaves our premises in the reporting period, sent for disposal to  landfill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Total fresh water use and consumption                               | Fresh water use as absolute measure (million m 3 ) and m 3  per ton production. \u00b7 Extraction recorded as surface, ground and potable water \u00b7 Use recorded as cooling, process and other use (e.g. hygiene, grounds) The majority of water is used for cooling and returned to the original source, slightly heated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Suppliers signed Business Partner Code of  Conduct (% of spend)     | Percentage product related spend (measured in euro value) with suppliers (raw materials and packaging) who have signed our business partner Code of Conduct.
