This Annual Report sets out how we are meeting the global challenges of today and capturing these new opportunities. Given Croda's long history of successful development, this journey is explored through our strong foundations, new horizons and consistent outperformance.\n\n## Purpose-led\n\nOur Purpose is the bedrock of our approach. Firstly, 2022 has seen us strive to deliver more for our customers, working closely with our partners to overcome global supply chain and demand challenges. The second year of our global survey showed an improvement in our customer rating. Secondly, we have looked after our employees in the face of escalating living costs - already a living wage employer, in 2022 we added new benefits, such as free private health care for all UK employees and one-off payments that benefitted many of our lower paid employees the most. All employees globally were gifted 10 Croda shares under our Free Share Plan, enabling them to share in Croda's success as shareholders, and recognising that our success is driven by our people, whom I thank on behalf of the\n\nBoard, for their hard work, dedication and customer focus. Thirdly, we are benefitting our communities, through our long-standing volunteering programme and educational outreach. In addition, the Croda Foundation has approved over \u00a31.1m in funding for 13 projects and distributed \u00a31.8m of restricted health care grants to vaccine and health infrastructure projects in South Asia, Africa and Brazil. Collectively these projects are benefitting over 14.9 million lives, including indigenous tribes in the Amazon as outlined in the case study to the right.\n\n## People-first culture\n\nCroda has always had a unique culture, built on customer intimacy and innovation, and reflecting an entrepreneurial spirit. Promoting this 'One Croda' culture and our values is important to our long-term success; in our decentralised model, this allows decisions to be taken close to customers, making us more agile, whilst delivering the governance and consistency we expect. Our culture is also enabling us successfully to onboard new employees with over 3,000 new employees joining Croda either through recruitment or acquisition since the end of 2019. Our employee survey is delivering consistently high engagement scores. The Board is also promoting diversity, with a target to achieve gender balance in leadership roles by 2030. 2022 saw women occupy 38% of these roles (2021: 36%).\n\n## An experienced Board\n\nAlongside having an effective and challenging Board, I am pleased that the Board has met gender and ethnic diversity commitments under the Parker and Hampton Alexander Reviews. We have also expanded the skill set of our Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) to reflect Croda's journey to a 'pure play' focus on Consumer Care and Life Sciences. During 2022, we welcomed Nawal Ouzren, CEO of biopharmaceutical company Sensorion, as a NED.\n\nThe 2023 AGM will see the retirement of two Board colleagues. Dr Helena Ganczakowski retires after nine years of NED service, having served as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director. Jez Maiden retires after eight years as Group Finance Director, to be replaced by Louisa Burdett, who joined the Board this January and who was, until recently, Chief Financial Officer of Meggitt Plc. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank both Helena and Jez for their outstanding contributions to the development and growth of Croda and for the diligence, intellect and thoughtful manner in which they have approached their roles. With our recent appointments, your Board has the diversity of experience to provide effective oversight and guidance as Croda enters its next phase of growth.",

        "page_content": "## Established business model\n\nCroda has a well established and powerful business model, founded on a direct sales force who build relationships with customers and provide insights into new opportunities, that are key to developing new products. We are a leading innovator in our markets, with a technology portfolio differentiated by valuable know-how, giving our ingredients unique characteristics. We leverage this portfolio to target fast growth niches, where our innovative and sustainable ingredients are valued through higher margins. This business model is enabling successful implementation of our strategy and consistent outperformance.\n\n## Exploring new horizons\n\nWhilst our Purpose remains constant and our culture and business model have developed with new challenges, our strategy has continued to evolve. Working together over the last two years, the Board and Executive Committee have repositioned Croda's portfolio to deliver future growth.\n\nThis repositioning is capturing new opportunities by refocusing the business away from maturing markets in order to capitalise on the future megatrends. In the consumer care market, sustainability is the biggest single driver over the next decade, accelerating the demand for sustainable ingredients. The life sciences market is being driven by the rise of biologics, complex molecules that are already transforming medicine and will transform agriculture over the next decade. Through our strategy implementation, including recent acquisitions and the successful divestment of most of our industrial business during 2022, we are responding to these megatrends, and becoming a pure play company focused on high value niches in Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This is creating a higher margin, higher return, less cyclical, more knowledge intensive, and lower carbon intensive business.\n\nThe divestment has also released capital to invest in scaling our consumer, pharma and crop care technologies. In line with our capital allocation policy, we are focused on reinvesting the proceeds in organic capital investment, leveraging the exciting growth opportunities in these markets. In 2022, we were pleased to agree co-investment programmes with the US and UK governments, recognising the importance of our pharma technologies to pandemic preparedness and drug discovery. Supporting our organic investment programme, we are continuing to explore opportunities in adjacent technologies that can further enhance our consumer and life science portfolio.\n\nAlongside enhanced investment, we are also committed to providing regular, growing returns to shareholders. The Board has proposed an 8% increase in the full year ordinary dividend and will continue to monitor the Group's ongoing capital requirements alongside any surplus capital, in line with our policy.\n\n## Delivering consistent outperformance\n\nCroda continued its consistent outperformance in 2022, despite challenging economic conditions resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, energy crisis and supply chain inflation. For the first time, we have delivered over \u00a32bn in sales and more than \u00a3500m in adjusted operating profit. This has reflected continued exciting growth across our Life Sciences sector, as well as our geographic footprint and broader portfolio in Consumer Care, providing a resilient platform. Importantly, we continued to invest, stepping up innovation with a focus on 'big bet' projects, and enhancing our leadership in sustainability, as customers look for sustainable alternatives that current suppliers cannot offer. Most important is that everyone within our business is kept safe; we maintained our behavioural safety performance in 2022 and, in 2023, have introduced safety improvement as a measure within the annual bonus scheme for the first time.\n\nWith our strong foundations, new horizons and consistent track record of outperformance, we look forward to the future with confidence.\n\nDame Anita Frew DBE, Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agroforestry in the Amazon\n\nThe Croda Foundation is supporting an Instituto Amazonas agroforestry project, which aims to revive traditional agriculture practices among indigenous tribes, improving food security and protecting their cultural heritage and environment. Targeting six tribes in Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazonia, this project will reach approximately 7,400 people and will use education programmes to build confidence in traditional agricultural methods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code\n\nto read more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our people and culture See pages 20-21",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review\n\n## Powerful operating model and consistent execution deliver record performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteve Foots, Group Chief Executive\n\n'We are building a strong innovation pipeline, supplemented by new technologies and organic investment.'\n\nSales\n\n\u00a32,089.3m\n\n(2021: \u00a31,889.6m)\n\nCroda achieved another milestone in 2022, exceeding \u00a32 billion of sales and \u00a3500 million of adjusted operating profit for the first time. This continues our record of consistent execution. We successfully recovered significant input cost inflation, and navigated challenging economic conditions and continued supply chain disruption. We are building a strong innovation pipeline, supplemented by new technologies and organic investment. Our performance demonstrates the power of our business model, the benefit of our global footprint, greater resilience following recent portfolio change and the increasing importance of our products in a range of niche markets.\n\nWe delivered an 11% increase in both sales and adjusted profit before tax, with good sales and profit growth in both core sectors. Consumer Care delivered a solid performance, with sales up 18% and adjusted operating profit 9% higher, albeit with margin diluted by lower volume and change in product mix. Growth remained robust in the second half year across Asia, Europe and Latin America, partly offset by customer destocking that was particularly apparent in North America. Life Sciences built on an exceptional 2021, delivering 19% sales growth and 10% higher adjusted operating profit, despite a reduction in COVID-19 vaccine demand by our principal customers. The balance of the Pharma business, together with Crop Protection and Seed Enhancement, each delivered double digit percentage sales growth.\n\nAdjusted operating profit was also higher in Industrial Specialties, benefitting from strong trading ahead of the divestment of the majority of its Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business midway through the year. Through this divestment, and the acquisitions in recent years, Croda has significantly repositioned to be more closely aligned with the powerful megatrends that are reshaping our markets. We are becoming a pure play company, focused on high value niches in consumer care and life science markets. This is creating a stronger margin, higher return, less cyclical and lower carbon intensive business. We are also more knowledge intensive, with exciting customer and technology innovation pipelines, particularly in sustainable solutions and drug delivery systems. This will translate into more consistent top line growth and increased margins, delivering superior returns in the years ahead.\n\n## Managing a challenging environment\n\nGroup sales grew by 11% to \u00a32,089.3m (2021: \u00a31,889.6m). Constant currency sales rose by 5%, driven by our ability to recover input cost inflation, with price/mix up by 24%. The chemical industry experienced a significant impact from inflation and average prices within our raw material basket rose by 23% in 2022, adding to a 17% increase in 2021. Commodity markets remained tight during the year but prices peaked in the third quarter, with signs of modest declines as the year ended. Operating cost inflation increased during 2022, with labour and energy most impacted. The strength of Croda's business model helped manage this challenging environment, ensuring inflation recovery and profit protection.\n\nGroup sales volume declined by 20%, with an estimated 13 percentage points of the reduction due to the divestment of much of the industrials business. In addition, after strong consumer demand and customer restocking post-pandemic in 2021, volume declined by 12% in Consumer Care, reflecting capacity constraints and customer reduction of excess inventory levels. Volume in Life Sciences was 8% higher, driven by strong Crop Protection demand, supported by the robust agricultural commodity pricing environment. Across the Group, the challenge of global supply chain constraints began to ease towards the end of the year.\n\nAdjusted operating profit grew by 10% to \u00a3515.1m (2021: \u00a3468.6m). Over half of this increase was driven by underlying growth across all three sectors, with the balance primarily from favourable currency translation. Return on sales was broadly flat at 24.7% (2021: 24.8%), with an improved margin mix from the reduced share of industrial sales and a lower variable remuneration charge offset by normalisation of the Life Sciences margin, after an exceptional 2021, and a lower Consumer Care margin diluted by lower",

        "page_content": "volume and weaker mix. Profit before tax (on an IFRS basis) increased to \u00a3780.0m (2021: \u00a3411.5m), which included a gain on the business disposal of \u00a3356.0m. Adjusting for this benefit and one-off exceptional items outlined in the Finance Review, adjusted profit before tax increased by 11% to a record \u00a3496.1m (2021: \u00a3445.2m).\n\nInflation and supply chain challenges saw increased working capital during 2021 and the first half of 2022. As expected, this began to moderate in the second half of 2022. Free cash flow increased to \u00a3167.4m (2021: \u00a3153.6m). Net debt reduced to \u00a3295.2m (2021: \u00a3823.2m) and debt leverage reduced to 0.5x (2021: 1.4x), due principally to the proceeds from the PTIC divestment.\n\n## Reinvesting in the business\n\nThe Group successfully completed the divestment of the majority of its PTIC business to Cargill Inc. on 30 June 2022 for gross proceeds of \u20ac775m (\u00a3665m). The divestment agreement also included a \u20ac140m option to sell Croda Sipo in China in which we have a 65% stake; however, this was subject to reaching agreement with our partner to also sell its stake, which now appears unlikely to occur in the near-term.\n\nThe divestment has released more capital to invest into a rich seam of growth opportunities in the consumer care and life sciences markets, whilst maintaining our discipline of careful capital allocation to projects which generate superior returns on capital. Our priority is organic capital expenditure, supplemented by targeted acquisitions, in line with our preferred approach to 'buy and build', as exemplified by our recent investments in Life Sciences, where we have secured new technology platforms through modest acquisition spends, then built scale through organic investment.\n\nOur investment in organic capital expenditure was \u00a3138.5m (2021: \u00a3158.5m). This investment included a new Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) operation in Brazil, expansion in protein technology in Consumer Care and new laboratory capabilities in Life Sciences, together with additional capacity in our Singapore plant and initial work on a new greenfield manufacturing site in India which will together meet fast growing demand in Asia. In addition to our typical capital investment of around 6% of sales, which includes delivering our carbon reduction roadmaps as part of our sustainability commitment, we are investing an extra \u00a3175m over the period 2021 to 2024 to broaden our Pharma footprint and capabilities, particularly for nucleic acid drugs. We are investing in our existing GMP sites in Denmark, the UK and Avanti (US), and creating a new Pharma facility in Pennsylvania (US) to meet forecast market demand, with over \u00a390m invested to date under this programme and spend expected to accelerate in 2023. Alongside this investment, the US and UK governments\n\nare co-investing up to an additional \u00a375m, recognising the importance of new generation delivery systems to global pandemic preparedness and drug discovery. This investment will support our innovation pipeline of sales from new product development in the Pharma business.\n\nWe expect to supplement our organic plan with selective acquisitions to add adjacent and complementary technologies, particularly those which can accelerate our transition to greater use of natural raw materials or build new technology platforms, enhancing future growth. Shortly after year end, we announced an agreement to acquire Solus Biotech, a leading producer of premium, biotechnology-derived beauty actives based in South Korea. Solus consolidates our position as a global leader in sustainable actives, builds our biotech knowledge base, adds a North Asian manufacturing and innovation facility, and brings rich IP and proprietary know-how that we can leverage globally. Our continued capital deployment will be executed within our consistent capital allocation policy, set out in the Finance Review. Alongside organic and inorganic investment, the policy provides for a regular and increasing ordinary dividend to shareholders, while operating an appropriate balance sheet. As part of this, the Board has recommended an increased full year declared dividend of 8% per share to 108.0p (2021: 100.0p).\n\n## Strong performance in Asia, Western Europe and Latin America\n\nOn a geographic basis, all regions saw continuing good growth in sales and profit, other than North America. Asia achieved a record year with strong demand, particularly in Life Sciences, and modest growth in China, despite pandemic lockdowns. Demand in Western Europe remained robust, despite higher prices and energy costs, with strong growth in Crop Protection and Beauty Care. Latin America enjoyed good growth, led by demand in the regional Crop Protection market and supported by Consumer Care demand, including the new F&F operation. EEMEA (Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa) saw a negative financial impact from the closure of our Russia business (which represented approximately 1% of Group sales in 2021).\n\nIn North America, sales peaked in the first quarter before softening in Consumer Care and Pharma, the latter partly reflecting lower COVID-19 demand post-pandemic.

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review continued\n\nConsumer Care sales growth 18% Life Sciences sales growth 19%\n\n## Continued growth across sectors\n\n## Consumer Care performance demonstrating increased resilience\n\nConsumer Care achieved record sales and adjusted operating profit in 2022. Sales grew by 18% to \u00a3897.8m (2021: \u00a3763.0m), with price/mix up 22% as significant inflation was successfully recovered. Adjusted operating profit increased by 9% to \u00a3204.7m (2021: \u00a3188.5m), resulting in return on sales reducing to 22.8% (2021: 24.7%). This primarily reflected the operating gearing effect of lower volume, alongside a weaker product mix as Beauty Care and F&F grew faster than the higher margin Beauty Actives business. IFRS operating profit declined to \u00a3144.5m (2021: \u00a3168.0m), which included an impairment charge of \u00a334.6m on goodwill in the Flavours business, where the future value of this business is behind the acquisition case.\n\nAfter a stand-out performance in Consumer Care in the first half of 2022, growth slowed in the second half year. Full year volume was 12% lower than 2021, driven by two components. Firstly, destocking developed across our customers and the retail supply chain. This followed strong demand in 2021 to meet the post-pandemic recovery, when customers, worried about global supply chain delays and meeting this recovery, restocked significantly; Personal Care sales grew by 20% in the second half of 2021. Slowing consumer sales led to destocking by customers in the second half of 2022, particularly in North America. Secondly, volume was lower due to selective demarketing of lower margin products due to capacity constraints in some Croda sites, together with the closure of our Russia office. It is estimated that customer destocking has accounted for five percentage points of the volume decline, with five points from demarketing and the balance from Russia and other impacts.\n\nOur sector strategy is to Strengthen to Grow and delivery is progressing well, positioning Consumer Care as a more resilient growth platform. Our ingredient transparency programme is supporting a structural shift in behaviour by customers and consumers towards sustainable ingredients, providing product information dossiers and carbon footprint data that includes upstream supply chain emissions. The sector delivered an increase in bio-based ingredients to 56% (2021: 50%), greater use of biotech across the product portfolio and nearly 290,000 tonnes of avoided carbon emissions in 2022. Greater innovation is also being delivered as part of an enhanced formulation capability, with our new Formulation Academies minimising the customer's time to market and giving smaller customers greater access to formulations containing Croda's high\n\nperformance ingredients. Consumer demand is growing strongly in Asia and, to deliver fast growth in the China domestic market, we have acquired a new site for a fragrance and botanicals facility.\n\nEncouragingly, sales growth was strongest in Beauty Care and F&F. Beauty Care benefitted from strong pricing, good demand from multinational customers and the move to sustainable ingredients. With strong growth in solar protection for daily wear, Croda's mineral sunscreens had a record year and sales of ECO bio-based surfactants to Personal Care customers increased threefold. In 2020 we added fragrances to Croda's portfolio and 2022 saw the creation of a full formulation service for customers. Sales in fragrances recovered well, after a challenging 2021, with growth in emerging markets, benefits from the integration of 2021's Parfex fine fragrance acquisition and a developing pipeline of sales synergies between Croda and Iberchem. Flavours suffered its worst year for raw materials, with 32% price inflation and shortage of supply, and margin was squeezed as the business did not fully recover input cost inflation. A quieter year for Beauty Actives sales nevertheless saw development into adjacent technologies continue, with the launch of encapsulated retinol and a growing pipeline of biotech-derived actives. The smaller Home Care business continued its roll out of high value proteins for fabric care, extending the life of clothes, with new contracts underpinning future growth.\n\n## Life Sciences building on exceptional prior year\n\nFollowing an outstanding year for Life Sciences in 2021, with the rapid expansion of Croda Pharma following the Avanti acquisition and exceptional demand for COVID-19 vaccines, 2022 saw further strong progress, driven by an excellent performance in Crop Protection and an extensive pipeline of non-COVID delivery systems in Pharma.\n\nSales grew by 19% to \u00a3682.3m (2021: \u00a3572.3m) with performance strengthening in the second half of the year. Price/mix grew by 6%, while volume was 8% higher. Adjusted operating profit increased by 10% to \u00a3229.4m (2021: \u00a3208.5.m), as did IFRS operating profit to \u00a3220.3m (2021: \u00a3201.0m). With Crop Protection a larger proportion of the sales mix and a normalising lipid systems margin, return on sales reduced to 33.6% (2021: 36.4%).",

        "page_content": "Our strategy to Expand to Grow in Life Sciences sees us empowering biologics delivery in Croda Pharma and reinforcing our existing leadership in sustainable delivery systems for Crop Care. In 2022, this saw the Health Care business repositioned as Croda Pharma, focused on technologies with the fastest growth and innovation needs. The relaunch was accompanied by a new brand, organisational structure and governance for its exciting customer and innovation pipelines. We are investing in innovation, knowledge and capacity, and secured co-investment from national governments. Crop Protection is meeting growing demand for sustainable crop care solutions and emerging delivery systems for crop biologics that are enabling customers to transition to biopesticides.\n\nEncouragingly, 2022's performance was achieved despite the anticipated near 40% decline in sales of lipid systems due to lower demand from our principal COVID-19 vaccine customers. The balance of the Pharma business, Crop Protection and Seed Enhancement all grew sales by double digit percentages. Crop Protection was the standout business, benefitting from a strong agricultural commodity pricing and demand environment. Its strength in sustainability was reflected in Croda's recognition by Syngenta in its 'Reduction in Carbon' supplier award. Seed Enhancement's range of coatings free from microplastics has now been proven in field trials with customers in all major regions and commercial roll out has commenced.\n\nIn Pharma, Protein/Small Molecule Delivery grew strongly, providing delivery systems for both the more mature small molecule drugs and the higher growth protein and monoclonal antibody (mAb) applications, with over a thousand customer projects underway. Adjuvant Systems experienced lower demand in COVID-19 applications, offset by growth in its current generation adjuvants, now supplied to over 100 customers, while supporting hundreds of projects to develop new prophylactic vaccines and novel therapeutic vaccines that fight already contracted diseases. These included a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in phase III trials and a personalised cancer vaccine in clinical phase II development.\n\nThe Nucleic Acid Delivery systems business is the world's leading innovator of lipid and other components in this new field of drug treatment. The business is developing its portfolio from the blockbuster COVID-19 vaccines, which drove 2021 demand, to new mRNA and gene therapy vaccines, and therapeutic drugs. 2022 sales in this business were approximately US$170m (2021: $230m), a little ahead of expectations, mainly due to additional COVID-19 vaccine demand; sales outside the principal COVID-19 vaccine customers already\n\nrepresent almost 40% of this business and are expected to be the majority of the $120m sales forecast for 2023, as COVID-19 sales continue to decline. We are supplying delivery systems to customers for close to 100 nucleic acid drugs currently in development, including the world's first human trial of a gene therapy application.\n\n## Industrial Specialties established\n\nWith the divesting of the majority of Croda's PTIC business on 30 June 2022, the remaining industrials business, including the Sipo joint venture in China, has become the Industrial Specialties sector. It plays an important role in our manufacturing model, supporting the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors on shared sites and operating a medium-term supply contract to the new owner of the divested business. 2022 therefore comprised the full business in the first half year and the retained business in the second half year. Reported sales were \u00a3509.2m (2021: \u00a3554.3m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a381.0m (2021: \u00a371.6m). It is estimated that, had the divestment occurred at the start of 2022, sales would have been \u00a3191m lower and adjusted operating profit \u00a339m lower in 2022. Reported IFRS profit was \u00a379.9m (2021: \u00a369.2m). After a strong first half year predivestment, Industrial Specialties continued to perform well, benefitting from higher commodity prices, with second half sales of \u00a3167m and a return on sales of 12.3%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Pharma business is developing delivery systems for biologic drugs which will enable the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics. Recognising the importance of our delivery systems for a wide range of nucleic acid applications, the US Government is supporting a capital expenditure programme, co-investing up to $75m to establish a lipid facility as part of a new multi-purpose cGMP site in Pennsylvania.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code to read more",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review continued\n\n## 71%\n\nof our people are motivated by our Purpose\n\n## Delivering our strategy\n\nWe combine leadership in sustainability with market-leading innovation to deliver consistent top and bottom-line growth, with profit growing ahead of sales, ahead of volume in the medium-term. This is enabling us to help to meet global challenges and capture new opportunities.\n\n## Delivering our sustainability Commitment\n\nSustainability trends are developing rapidly in our markets as consumers look to make a positive contribution to living more sustainably through the products that they buy. In addition, climate change poses a major risk to the planet which we must all address. We enable customers to realise their sustainability ambitions through the application of our innovation, creating sustainable alternatives that current supply chains cannot offer. We are reinforcing our sustainability leadership by reducing the adverse impact of our operations, by replacing fossil-based ingredients with bio-based materials, reducing emissions, promoting biodiversity and ensuring our sourcing activities make a positive contribution to communities in our supply chains. Our sustainability strategy is built on 23 UN SDG targets grouped around the themes of climate, nature and society, supporting our commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.\n\nTo be Climate Positive, our verified carbon reduction target will ensure we contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, providing customers with an average 35% reduction in carbon emissions associated with our products by 2030, compared to our 2018 baseline. To achieve this Science Based Target (SBT), we have developed externally validated decarbonisation roadmaps for every Croda location and adopted an internal carbon price to ensure investment decisions align with our sustainability ambitions. We have also continued our focus on upstream supply chains, with almost a quarter of suppliers by volume committed to SBTi carbon reduction targets.\n\nBuilding on our Land Positive commitment, we announced our aspiration to be Net Nature Positive by 2030 and are working to understand our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity. We also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and its Nature programmes, with the aim of being an early adopter of the future Science Based Targets for Nature, when published.\n\nOur People Positive objective addresses the needs of both our communities and our employees. Living our Purpose, Smart science to improve lives TM , we have met our target to protect 60 million people from the damaging effects of the sun, seven years ahead of\n\nschedule. Additionally, the Croda Foundation distributed \u00a31 million of funding to 13 projects and another \u00a32 million of grants for health infrastructure projects in South Asia, Africa and Brazil, in total benefitting 15 million people. Our employee engagement surveys show that 71% of our people are motivated by our Purpose and 69% feel involved in delivering our sustainability ambitions. With a target to achieve gender balance in Croda leadership roles by 2030, 2022 saw women occupy 38% of these roles (2021: 36%). Reflecting our absolute commitment to be a safe company for our communities and our employees, we set a stronger safety target to reduce our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to 0.3 by 2025, requiring us to more than halve our current rate of 0.74 (2021: 0.76 restated), excluding COVID-19 cases. We conducted a safety culture survey at more than 40 sites, enabling us to identify areas for particular focus.\n\nWe have reflected the impact of the PTIC divestment in our sustainability targets. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced by 26% as a result of the sale and we have re-baselined our target to maintain the original challenge. The proportion of bio-based organic raw materials reduced to 59% due to the disposal (2021: 69%) but we have retained our original target to achieve 75% by 2030. We have also retained our carbon cover target (where use of our products avoids four times the carbon emissions associated with operating our business) which becomes more stretching as a result of the divestment.\n\n## Driving innovation\n\nInnovation is at the heart of what we do, creating new market and technology niches. We have stepped up our rate of innovation through more resource investment, more external partnerships and a focus on 'big bet' projects. This will support higher growth, improved mix and better margin as we become a more knowledge-intensive company, capturing more intellectual property (IP).\n\nThe foundation of our innovation model is internal R&D investment, applying the expertise of our scientists at our global innovation centres to meet customer needs. This is complemented by our open innovation network, which provides access to over 500 universities and SMEs to help develop new intellectual property. We also invest externally in disruptive technologies, the benefits of which can be seen in recent product launches that have leveraged expertise in both biotech and encapsulation to reduce impacts and improve efficacy.\n\nOur 'big bet' projects are reinforcing our leadership in formulation science and harnessing the potential of biotech, alongside our conventional chemical",

        "page_content": "technologies. In formulation science, we are developing a greater understanding of the impact of our ingredients on wellbeing and self-esteem through neuroscience research, and are sharing our expertise with customers through our new Formulation Academies. We are scaling biotech, with projects to develop more sustainable actives and bio-based fragrance ingredients. R&D here is led by our five biotech laboratories, mostly established through technology acquisitions over the last decade. Candidate technologies are then scaled up at application laboratories in Paris and two UK facilities, before being taken to market by existing business units. Beauty Actives is launching novel anti-ageing and anti-dandruff ingredients developed in this way.\n\nWe seek to drive New & Protected Product (NPP) sales growth at least as fast as total sales over the cycle, targeted at mid to high single digit percentage growth. This allows the business to grow through IP-rich NPP and technology acquisitions, while leveraging our rich heritage product portfolio by finding new applications and data for existing products. In 2022, NPP sales grew at 2.6% in constant currency, adjusting for the impact of the PTIC divestment, despite lower lipid systems sales in the year.\n\n## Sector strategies to deliver consistent growth and even stronger margins\n\nWithin our strategy to drive sustainability and innovation to deliver profitable growth, each of our seven businesses within the two focus sectors targets superior sales growth, at least one and a half times global GDP, margins of at least 20% and return on invested capital (ROIC) of at least twice our cost of capital over the medium-term.\n\nOur vision for Consumer Care is to be the most sustainable, innovative and responsive solution provider globally through our Strengthen to Grow strategy. Consumer Care targets annual organic sales growth of at least 5%, supplemented by synergies from integrating the recent F&F acquisitions, with a return on sales at or above 25%, over the medium-term.\n\nOur vision for Life Sciences is to empower biologics delivery, enabling our customers to transition to biologic actives which are transforming pharmaceutical and crop science markets. Our Expand to Grow strategy is reinforcing our leadership in sustainable delivery systems in Crop Care and positioning Croda Pharma in drug and vaccine markets which need complex, innovative delivery systems. Life Sciences targets high single digit percentage annual sales growth, with a return on sales over 30% over the medium-term.\n\nSupporting our strategic themes of 'Strengthen to Grow Consumer Care', 'Expand to Grow Life Sciences' and 'Scaling Biotech', as set out above, are three additional strategic initiatives:\n\n'Fast Grow Asia' , where we are expanding our technical capabilities and building new manufacturing capacity, to serve rising regional consumption of Consumer Care products and growing opportunities in Pharma and Crop Care. Investment in innovation and sales resource helped deliver a record year for Asia. We are continuing to expand our manufacturing capability in Asia, including commencing construction of a new greenfield site in India, to support the exciting opportunities ahead;\n\n'Proactive Acquisitions' , where our global scouting network is identifying potential adjacent technology opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences, such as the Solus Biotech acquisition announced in February 2023; and\n\n'Doing the Basics Brilliantly' ,which is improving our customer and employee experience through a combination of digital technology, customer insights, new data architectures, enhanced manufacturing capability and employer branding. 2022 saw good results in our customer 'Net Promoter Score' (NPS) and a new customer self-serve ordering online portal developed for global roll-out.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThough early in the year, the Group is trading in line with expectations. We expect the customer destocking that has been particularly apparent in North America to come to an end in the first half year, supporting continued sales growth this year in Consumer Care. In Life Sciences, we expect good sales growth in Crop Care and the non-COVID related Pharma business to offset the previously indicated decline in COVID-19 vaccine demand. Group performance in 2023 will be more second half weighted than in the prior year, reflecting the divestment of the majority of PTIC in June 2022 and the phasing of lipid systems shipments to our principal COVID-19 vaccine customers.\n\nThe combination of our differentiated business model, enhanced investment programme and exciting innovation pipelines in sustainable ingredients and drug delivery, will continue to deliver consistent, superior returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteve Foots, Group Chief Executive\n\n## 69%\n\nof employees feel involved in delivering our sustainability strategy\n\nThe Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 27 th February 2023 and signed on its behalf by Steve Foots.",

This is lower than most peers as we manufacture comparatively low volumes. We are currently augmenting this with targeted organic investment to scale up our pharmaceutical technology platforms.\n\n## Capital\n\nOur capital needs are serviced principally by loans and credit facilities including a green banking facility. Our leverage ratio of 0.5x net debt to EBITDA is below our target range of 1-2x over the medium-term cycle, allowing future investment, both organic and through acquisitions.\n\nMulti-sector R&D facility at Cowick Hall, United Kingdom.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## R&D\n\nWe spent \u00a366m in 2022 on in-house innovation. This is complemented by a pipeline of technology acquisitions and over 500 open innovation partners. These partnerships are important to our business model as they facilitate collaboration with leading scientists in universities and SMEs and give us access to specialist, world class expertise and facilities.\n\n## Supply chain and logistics\n\nWe have a global network of local warehouses around the world ensuring we can deliver ingredients directly to customers with speed and agility. Despite recent global supply chain challenges, our focus on high value, low volume niches and successful supply chain management means we have avoided significant disruption, beyond escalating freight costs which are a small proportion of our costs.\n\n## Energy\n\nEnergy costs are ~3% of sales. We use heat to accelerate chemical reactions with energy provided from a variety of internal and external sources. Energy is a relatively small percentage of our cost base compared with others in our sector and we have limited direct exposure to potential gas disruption in Europe.\n\n## Regulations\n\nAll regions where we operate have regulations that apply to the ingredients we produce and the applications they are used for. Correctly scoped regulation builds confidence in the efficacy of our products and we actively shape regulations and voluntary standards, working collaboratively with industry partners.\n\nManufacturing capability at our Beauty Actives site in Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We promote a 'One Croda' culture through our Remuneration Policy and high levels of employee share ownership which encourages everyone to work together to achieve our goals. We strive to be more agile and entrepreneurial than our competitors, with a decentralised operating model that ensures decisions are made 'close to customers'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our people and culture See pages 20-21\n\n## Customer intimacy\n\nWe employ our own local, science-focused sales force who understand our customers. This is unusual in our markets where sales are often through distributors. This direct selling model builds relationships with customers and provides us with insights about their challenges, as well as changing consumer behaviour, that are key to how we innovate. We complement direct selling with local innovation centres where we co-formulate with customers in our laboratories and accelerate their time-to-market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation leadership\n\nWe are the leading innovator in our markets with a technology portfolio differentiated by valuable protected intellectual property and know-how, including 1,500 patents across 250 patent families. This means our ingredients have unique characteristics and deliver higher value add. We have a collaborative, open innovation model which combines internal R&D with partnering and technology acquisitions. We are becoming a more knowledge-intensive company as a result of this innovation ecosystem and our recent acquisitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSensory testing with consumer panellists in Singapore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe solutions we provide enhance everyday life.\n\n## Sustainability leadership\n\nWe were founded in 1925 to create lanolin from wool grease, a by-product of the textile industry, and have been building sustainability into our business ever since. Now, we have a long-term sustainability strategy embedded in the way we work to ensure we deliver on our Commitment to be the world's most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients by 2030. With consumers determined to make a positive impact through the products they buy, the creation of sustainable ingredients is a key driver of our future commercial success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach to growth\n\nWe grow by creating new market and technology niches rather than by winning market share in large established markets. We target fast-growth niches that value our leadership in innovation and sustainability through higher margins. This allows us to compete on value rather than on price, supporting our goal of delivering profit growth, ahead of sales growth, ahead of volume growth.\n\nThere is no one big competitor that spans all our markets; instead, there are different competitors in each of our niches. We have a broad base of customers, large and small. This high number of customer/product combinations reduces our exposure to any specific customer, market or geography.\n\nWe sell in test tube and vial quantities, rather than tanker loads, and are increasingly moving to selling in dollars per gram rather than dollars per kilo. This means we operate flexible, capital-light manufacturing sites, rather than large continuous operation plants, and do not have to invest significant capital to create value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our investor proposition See page 43",

We believe that embedding our values throughout the organisation will enable us to attract and retain the best talent, unlock our people's full potential and deliver high performance and engagement within our teams.\n\n## Our culture is defined through our values of ' Responsible ',\n\n' Innovative ' and ' Together ' and in 2021 a set of 14 competencies were introduced describing how our values are exhibited and can be developed through specific behaviours within our work.\n\nThese competencies are used as part of our annual performance and development reviews, succession planning and talent processes. They are also used as selection criteria for promotion and participation in our global development programmes.\n\nAll of our new competencies encompass inclusive behaviours with one dedicated to inclusivity. We are making progress implementing our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Roadmap which covers data gathering, improving awareness, developing our brand, measurement, and alignment to reward. In 2022, we promoted awareness through new development programmes and improved our data gathering through better measurement of employee engagement.\n\n## Measuring our culture\n\nTo measure employee engagement and commitment to our Purpose and sustainability goals, we introduced surveys in 2022 to define a Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) score.\n\nWhile the overall score of 68% was good, the survey identified focus areas where there is further work to do to build the best workplace for all.\n\nWe intend to measure our PSC score over several years to track our progress in creating a positive environment for our employees and to understand how we can further improve employee engagement. This score will be reported in our Annual Report and, for 2023, improvement in the PSC score will be a metric within our long-term incentive plan (see pages 108-110).\n\n## Our 2022 culture surveys\n\n|          | Topic                          | Quarterly theme                        |\n|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Survey 1 | Safety, health and environment | 'Reward'                               |\n| Survey 2 | Our Purpose                    | 'Motivated by   Purpose / Commitments' |\n| Survey 3 | Our values                     | 'Great place to work'                  |\n| Survey 4 | Our sustainability Commitment  | 'Doing what we say'                    |\n\nAs part of our 'One Croda' culture we have prioritised supporting our employees through the global cost of living crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo read more on how we are supporting our people through the current cost-of-living crisis See pages 102-105\n\n## Competencies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Authenticity\n- \u00b7  Cross cultural sensitivity\n- \u00b7  Inclusivity\n- \u00b7  Living the values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Curiosity\n- \u00b7  Strategic perspective\n- \u00b7  Adaptability\n- \u00b7  Delivery\n\n## Foundational competencies\n\n- \u00b7  Technical/functional expertise\n- \u00b7  Self-led learning\n\n## Purpose and Sustainability Commitment score for 2022\n\nOur overall PSC score for 2022 was 68%, with an average participation rate for the surveys of 77%. The PSC score is a measure of employee satisfaction using a five point scoring methodology. As many of our employees work shifts in production environments, we made the surveys as accessible as possible. Every survey was translated into 16 different languages and could be completed online, via a QR code on mobile devices, or on paper copies. Surveys were completed anonymously with only basic personal data collected to aid understanding.\n\nResults were shared with local and regional teams to develop tailored site plans to address specific opportunities for improvement. Many local management teams ran listening groups to gain further insight and greater understanding.\n\nOur PSC score reflects responses across the five point scoring criteria and is the median response given, with the lowest score for any of the questions we asked being 53% and the highest 80%.\n\nWe consider our score in 2022 to be 'good', however, recognise there is further work to do to ensure we continue to build the best workplace for all. Key insights from our 2022 surveys are shown below.\n\n74%\n\nof employees would recommend Croda as a great place to work\n\n74%\n\nof employees would agree that SHE is not compromised\n\n71%\n\nof employees feel motivated by our Purpose\n\n69%\n\nof employees feel they can get involved in sustainability\n\n- \u00b7  Working together\n- \u00b7  Empathy\n- \u00b7  Care and compassion\n- \u00b7  Managing conflict",

Using our competency framework, we have progressed several projects to further embed our Purpose and values into our processes for recruiting and developing people.\n\nTo support our recruitment process, we worked in partnership with an external agency to integrate our competencies into their Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ). This will improve hiring decisions, helping to recruit people whose behaviours align with our values and culture.\n\nOur global leadership development programmes were relaunched in 2022. We recognise that having an inclusive culture is the only way that diversity can thrive, and embedding our values to develop and reward inclusive leadership starts with the way we select attendees for our global leadership programmes. We select colleagues who exhibit model behaviours aligned with our values and use the programmes to develop them further, with content tailored to our strategic objectives through the competency model.\n\n## Our development programmes\n\n## Phoenix Rising\n\nFor a cross section of colleagues looking to unlock potential and/or increase contribution must display a strong commitment to inclusion and self development.\n\nLDG* Plus For established senior colleagues in key roles, who may have completed a past version of the LDG.\n\nLDG High performing, high potential senior colleagues.\n\n## Accelerated Leadership\n\nProgramme High performing mid-level employees showing leadership behaviours.\n\nLeading with Purpose A values aligned development programme available to all grades.\n\n## Responsible, Innovative, Together\n\nWe also launched a regionally based early careers programme for managers, 'Leading with Purpose', complemented by the provision of several online webinars covering a range of leadership and diversity topics.\n\nAll employees are encouraged to undertake regular training and we have set a target for all employees to receive at least one week's training annually by 2023. In 2022 our employees collectively undertook over 145,000 hours of training, translating to an average of 26.1 hours per employee (2021: 14.5 (excluding PTIC)).\n\n- * Leadership Development Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more Board and Group diversity data See page 95\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code to watch more on the Accelerated Leadership Programme which launched in 2022.\n\nRetaining talent is important to us and we track voluntary employee turnover on a quarterly basis. Our voluntary employee turnover rate for 2022 was 8.5% (2021: 8.2%). We are comfortable that our continued focus on Purpose and culture will support our ambition to be an employer of choice, and that this will be reflected in below average voluntary turnover figures.\n\n## Behavioural safety\n\nEnsuring the safety of our people is of the utmost importance and despite the lack of progress in our Total Recordable Injury Rate during 2022, we are committed to improvements. In the second quarter of 2022, our senior leadership conference focused on safety, aiming to drive cultural change and a values-driven approach to health and safety, with all leaders signing up to personal safety development objectives which will form part of the senior annual Bonus Plan in 2023. A Safety Culture Survey was conducted in 2022 at over 40 Croda sites, with engagement levels of over 85%, enabling us to identify sites and processes for particular focus as we continue to improve our health and safety performance.\n\nThe 'Human Performance Programme' developed in 2021 was rolled out to six sites, creating opportunities for meaningful conversations about how work is carried out, the real risks people face, and empowering all employees to take ownership of safety and suggest improvements. In 2022, more than 100 improvements were identified across these six sites and resources are being allocated to enable a roll out to all sites over the next three years.\n\n## Key people metrics\n\n## Employee employment status\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, not only does society need to transition to carbon net zero, it needs to do so by embracing the role nature plays in mitigating and adapting to climate change, and by addressing social inequalities. Consumers in developed markets, and increasingly in China and around the world, are supporting businesses they believe act responsibly. This includes understanding societal challenges, protecting and restoring nature, and providing solutions to mitigate the causes and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate.\n\n## World population of\n\n## 10bn\n\nprojected by 2050 1 (2022: 8bn)\n\n## The enabler:\n\n## Digitalisation facilitating faster, more connected supply chains\n\nDigital is changing expectations about transparency, with consumers demanding businesses take responsibility for their own operations, their supply chains and their products at end of life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global demand for health and wellbeing\n\nThe pandemic has laid bare public health challenges around the world and accelerated the demand for health care, already growing due to higher global population, rising malnutrition and an ageing population in developed countries. Following two years of lockdowns, consumers are much more conscious of their own physical and mental wellbeing, and the importance of healthier communities more broadly. This has increased the focus on the efficacy of products, with increased demand for ingredients that are underpinned by science, and that support physical and mental health.\n\n## Increase in food output of\n\n70%\n\nrequired by 2050 2\n\nDigital is also increasing the speed at which new trends are adopted, enabling businesses to deliver transformative solutions from wherever they are conceived. Successful products are those which are innovative, highly effective, low impact, sustainably sourced, and clearly labelled.\n\n- 1. United Nations, World Population Prospects 2022\n- 2. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Global agriculture towards 2050\n- 3. The Global Environment Facility, Land Degradation\n\n## Feeding a growing population and restoring nature\n\nThe world population passed eight billion in 2022 and is expected to reach nearly ten billion by 2050 1 with the majority of the increase coming in south and east Asia, and Africa. Feeding this growing population will require a 70% increase in agricultural output by 2050 2 , and the challenge is achieving this in a sustainable, regenerative way. Agriculture has undergone yieldenhancing shifts in the past but yields of important crops such as rice and wheat have now stopped rising in some intensively farmed parts of the world. Agricultural soils have been over-used and over-exposed to chemical fertilisers, destroying their vitality and threatening the food security of 3.2 billion people 3 , especially smallholder farmers and poor rural communities. Since most suitable land is already farmed, most of this growth will come from higher yields and more resilient crops in less suitable land, supported by restoring degraded ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the trends in our markets as a result of these challenges See page 26\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Megatrends continued\n\n## The technology trends affecting our markets\n\n## 1. Move to sustainable ingredients\n\nConsumers want to live more sustainably and this is impacting their decisions when it comes to the products that they buy. Generational shifts are accelerating these trends with an increasing number of consumers willing to pay more for purpose-led brands that meet their specific values. Sustainability will be the biggest single driver of consumer markets over the next decade and beyond.\n\nConsumer-facing companies need to enhance consumer trust in their brands, so are looking for ingredients that enable them to deliver products with proven, substantiated claims and transparent, assured information on their social and environmental footprints. Sustainable ingredients must have a low footprint in terms of the carbon, water and resources used in their manufacture, and should also contribute to enabling consumers to live more sustainably.\n\nGrowing consumer demand for sustainable ingredients is driving increased regulation by industry and national authorities. For example, there are now very few countries in the world without cosmetic legislation and an increasing number of countries also have chemical regulations in place, with many more set to adopt chemical legislation in the coming years. Increasingly widespread and thorough legislation is providing a higher threshold for approval for new ingredients while increasing consumer confidence about the footprint and sustainability benefits of the products they buy.\n\nThe move to sustainable ingredients is not confined to consumer markets. Not only do crop science companies want biodegradable ingredients with a low carbon footprint, they also need innovative ingredients that make a positive contribution to improving yields, soil health and biodiversity.\n\nAlongside more sustainable chemistry, biotechnology can be a highly sustainable route for creating new and existing molecules that have applications in high growth markets of today and the future. Designed correctly, biotechnology will enable ongoing performance innovation, facilitate ingredient footprint reduction, and support the transformation to bio-based ingredients.\n\n## 2. Move to biologics\n\nIn Life Sciences, the 20 th century was the era of the small molecule, relatively simple compounds made by chemical synthesis. The 21 st century is the era of biologics, much larger molecules manufactured inside animal cells or micro-organisms, that are already transforming medicine and will transform agriculture over the next decade.\n\nBiologic drugs mimic closely our body's biology and are much better at treating disease in a targeted way with fewer side effects. But they are complex molecules that are hard to make, difficult to keep stable, and need sophisticated delivery systems. They are also difficult to administer and are normally injected because otherwise they would be destroyed by stomach acid when swallowed.\n\nThe nucleic acid revolution that we are now witnessing, best illustrated by the global roll out of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, is the next phase in the move to biologics. It is creating an incredible number of opportunities because nucleic acids teach the body to create its own medicine. This is a fundamental shift in the complexity of new drugs and in their value - both in terms of patient outcomes and commercial opportunities for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAlthough crop science is some years behind, it is also experiencing a transformation to biologically active ingredients. For example, naturally occurring microbes act as fertilisers for plants but have yet to be exploited systematically to raise crop yields. The nucleic acid revolution is also making new approaches possible in agriculture. For example, RNA interference could be used as a precisely targeted, environmentally friendly pesticide, by preventing the production of a critical molecule in the body of a specific pest.\n\nThe ability for these biologics to target specific elements in the host offers a significant opportunity to reduce negative impacts on the planet and society. Increased targeting means reduced overall dosage, fewer unintended side effects and the need for fewer resources to produce the same benefits. Novel performance means new approaches such as improved vaccination to both prevent and cure diseases, and regenerative agriculture that leverages the power of nature.",

Often not visible to the eye, plastic microbeads provide functionality such as exfoliation, sensory enhancement or adding texture to cosmetic formulations. However, they often end up in oceans, with a potentially negative impact on marine life.\n\nUsing patented technology Croda has developed ChromaPur as an alternative. These cellulose powders provide exceptional sensory and optical benefits, including optically blurring the skin surface, reducing the appearance of pores and fine lines, and providing enhanced coverage and colour intensity in colour cosmetics. These alternatives to plastic microbeads are 100% natural, fully biodegradable, utilise a sustainable manufacturing process, and deliver equivalent performance to existing solutions.\n\n- 1. www.plasticsoupfoundation.org 1. www.plasticsoupfoundation.com",

It is also a resilient market, largely independent of the macro-economic environment.\n\nThe chart opposite shows the pharma market segmented by growth potential and development need. At the bottom is the mature small molecules segment, very big and still growing middle single digit, but without the need for significant development. Above it is the protein segment, including monoclonal antibodies. Protein drugs have been developed over the last few decades and represented the first phase of the move to biologics. They account for the majority of the top ten selling drugs today and can cost thousands of dollars per treatment. Although this segment is relatively large already, it is still growing double digit. At the top is the nucleic acid segment which is the next phase of the move to biologics. Whilst it is currently a small segment, it is growing extremely fast and is widely regarded as the next blockbuster drug class. This is because nucleic acids can address the root cause of a disease. They have the potential to change the way that patients with cancer or genetic diseases are treated, and in some cases even provide a cure.\n\nVery few drug formulations comprise the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) alone. Croda focuses on providing the components and systems for delivering the API. We are empowering biologics delivery by developing systems that deliver the API to the target site in the body, maintain its stability and improve its efficacy. For protein delivery we provide a range of speciality excipients for challenging formulations including injectables. By focusing on high value niches, we are the largest excipient supplier by value. In adjuvant systems, we are the only independent supplier with a full component portfolio and the ability to put those vaccine adjuvants together to power the therapeutic vaccines of the future. We are the leading innovator of components for nucleic acid delivery, capable of both developing new systems and scaling them up to support commercial roll out. We leverage more than 50 years' experience acquired with Avanti and the co-investments we are making with governments in the US and UK.\n\nIn total we have over 5,000 customers across the whole lifecycle of a drug, from research to commercial manufacturing. Our approach is to develop delivery systems for candidate drugs in early-stage research, generating revenue during clinical development and then as the principal supplier of the delivery system if the drug is commercialised. Our broad base means that we are not dependent on a single customer, and instead are exposed to a wide range of customers, drugs and applications.\n\nWe are pioneering the future of health care by focusing on segments with a high development need. Our key differentiator is innovation, creating new ingredients from sustainable sources that have a unique quality. By combining these ingredients into systems tailored for specific applications we can price our products based on the value of the outcome, thereby creating value for shareholders as well as contributing to new treatments for patients.\n\n## Supplying delivery systems to help prevent cardiovascular disease\n\nNucleic acid-based therapies are the next big blockbuster drug class opening up exciting applications such as gene editing, where a patient's genetic material can be modified to correct a disorder. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics require sophisticated technologies to deliver the active and overcome challenges such as instability.\n\nCroda is the leader in non-viral delivery systems for nucleic acid. We are working on many gene therapy applications including a phase III trial with Verve Therapeutics to cure genetically induced high cholesterol, a condition affecting 31 million people worldwide that can lead to accelerated heart disease and early death. Verve Therapeutics recently dosed the world's first patient with a gene editing medicine to correct the disorder, using lipids supplied by Croda as the delivery system. In preclinical studies, a single dose of the drug to silence the problematic gene resulted in a 60% reduction in LDL-cholesterol, persisting for 20 months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code\n\nto read more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our Pharma businesses See pages 38-41",

        "page_content": "We are at a pivotal moment for the agriculture industry which is facing the dual imperatives of delivering higher yields to feed a growing population and reducing chemical use to support sustainable food production 1 . Through our deep understanding of plant science, we can contribute to increasing food production without the need to use more land, thereby helping to improve global food security. We are also innovating to accelerate sustainable and regenerative agriculture in line with our aspiration to become Net Nature Positive by 2030.\n\nThe conventional crop care market is large, valued at $60bn, and growing at 3% a year. The market for biopesticides is much smaller at $5bn but is growing at 8% CAGR. While agriculture has traditionally relied on chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the industry is moving to biologics which are more specific and have a lower impact on biodiversity.\n\nThrough our expertise in delivery systems, we are enabling our customers to make the move to biologic actives. Today, predators are used to control insects in greenhouses. Next, micro-organisms will be used more widely as pesticides, stimulants or fertilisers, and we are developing next generation delivery systems for these new microbial actives. In the future, nucleic acid will be used to target a specific pest, avoiding unintended impacts on pollinators, or to teach a plant to make its own medicine to inactivate a disease, and we are innovating to enable this approach. The move to biologics is a significant opportunity for Croda as biopesticides, biostimulants and biofertilisers all need new systems to ensure their effective delivery.\n\nOur expertise in seed enhancement supports this move to biologics as microbials can be applied via treated seeds to stimulate growth thereby delivering higher yields and reducing the need for the crop to be sprayed. We are also helping solve the problems the industry is facing, for example being first to market with a microplastic-free seed coating many years before new regulation, and by ensuring seeds germinate in the more challenging conditions created by climate change.\n\nWith the agriculture sector a major contributor to global GHG emissions, we recognise we must both create solutions for the future and help address the challenges of today. We create biostimulants to enable farming of less suitable land and mitigations for abiotic stress that promote plant growth in the increasingly harsh weather conditions. We offer drift reduction technologies to target spraying of crops, a key enabler to new farming practices such as drone application, and to reduce pesticide use and run-off. Our low carbon and bio-based delivery systems are enabling the move to sustainable ingredients, and our expertise in biodegradability is promoting soil health.\n\n## Microplastic-free seed coatings\n\nSeed coatings and treatments provide vital protection against pests and diseases, reducing the need to spray chemical plant protection products and fertilisers. Many seed coating products contain polymer-based binders which have poor biodegradability profiles and leave small plastic particles in the soil.\n\nAgricultural activity accounts for about 10% of the total microplastic release and while seed treatment accounts for a small proportion of this, we can still play a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of microplastics. Our range of microplastic-free seed coatings launched in 2021 have been applied to crop and vegetable seeds covering over 100,000 hectares of land. We expect this to grow as European customers adopt our microplastic-free alternatives ahead of legislation banning microplastics in seed coatings from 2028, and other regions also adopt similar legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code\n\nto read more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith our focus on delivery systems, Croda is positioned as innovation partner to the major crop science companies. Innovation is becoming more collaborative as delivery systems become more specific to the active.

Sales were up 18% and adjusted operating profit 9% higher. Across the four businesses, Beauty Care and F&F saw the strongest growth. Beauty Care developed well in the higher value niches driven by demand for sustainable ingredients, such as mineral sunscreens. Within F&F, sales in fragrances recovered after a challenging 2021, as emerging market conditions improved, alongside developing Croda sales synergies and benefits from integration of the recent Parfex acquisition. Beauty Actives had a quieter year, with destocking impacting performance but good progress integrating the recent Alban Muller acquisition. Home Care grew with the roll out of high value protein ingredients.\n\nSales grew to \u00a3897.8m (2021: \u00a3763.0m). Price/mix was up 22% as significant input cost inflation was successfully recovered. Volume was 12% lower than 2021, driven by two components. Firstly, excess stocks across our customers and the retail supply chain, following strong demand in 2021 to meet the post-pandemic recovery, led to destocking by customers in the second half of 2022, particularly in North America. Secondly, volume was lower due to selective demarketing of lower margin products due to capacity constraints in some Croda sites, together with the closure of our Russia office. It is estimated that customer destocking has accounted for five percentage points of the volume decline, with five points from demarketing and the balance from Russia and other impacts. Previous acquisitions added 2% to overall sales growth (in their first 12 months of ownership) and currency translation added 6%.\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased to \u00a3204.7m (2021: \u00a3188.5m). Return on sales reduced to 22.8% (2021: 24.7%), with second half year margin lower due to the gearing effect of lower volume and the impact of the adverse business mix, as Beauty Care and F&F grew faster than the higher margin Beauty Actives business. IFRS operating profit declined to \u00a3144.5m (2021: \u00a3168.0m), including an impairment charge of \u00a334.6m to the carrying value of the Flavours business, where lower forecast sales and margin have reduced the future value projection.\n\nDelivery of our Strengthen to Grow strategy is progressing well, positioning Consumer Care as a more resilient growth platform. Consumer care products are increasingly synonymous with wellbeing and self-esteem, with consumers willing to pay a premium for new trends and high quality/low impact products that are good for them and good for the planet. Croda is positioned as the leading innovator, developing cutting edge products with substantiated claims and fully assured impact data for customers to develop their new products. In 2022, we published product information dossiers on our products and are developing life cycle assessments and associated carbon footprint data that include the scope 3 carbon emission data for our products. Driving fast innovation and minimising customers' time to market, we have launched Formulation Academies, promoting our full service formulation capability and giving smaller customers greater access to market-leading formulations. With over 70,000 customer/product combinations in F&F and 40,000 across the remainder of Consumer Care, the Academies are benefitting all our businesses, but particularly Beauty Care and F&F.\n\nWe are expanding in Asia, with rising regional consumption increasing penetration of consumer care products and Croda's sales now matching those in North America. China is likely to be the fastest growing market, with Croda already well established and serving the domestic market through imports and local production, achieving high single digit percentage sales growth in 2022 despite local COVID lockdowns. With our 'fast grow Asia' strategic initiative, investment in China is increasing innovation and sales resource, replicating our US model to serve a growing customer base of 'Indie' brands and acquiring a site to expand our fragrance and botanical production. More broadly, investment in Consumer Care is focused on expanding sustainable technologies, including biotech. We continue to explore targeted acquisition of adjacent knowledge-rich technologies, building on the agreement to acquire Solus Biotech, with its rich IP and proprietary know-how in biotechderived beauty actives.",

        "page_content": "Skin care is a growth market, with the anti-ageing niche we target growing even faster. Beauty Actives has the largest active ingredient portfolio. Underlying sales were flat in 2022 against a strong prior year which had seen sales grow close to 30%, and the business experienced customer destocking in the third quarter but recovering somewhat as the year finished. Beauty Actives increased its customer base and innovation pipeline. Croda is the recognised leader in peptide ingredients, an effective anti-ageing technology, and is expanding into two other critical technology platforms - retinol and ceramides. In retinol, 2022 saw the launch of Revitalide, which is differentiated through encapsulation, leveraging expertise from our Brazil encapsulation centre of excellence, which improves skin penetration ninefold and doubles its lasting effect. We are entering the ceramides market through the agreement to acquire Solus.\n\nBeauty Care saw success from new teams focused on mineral sunscreens and professional hair care, segments growing twice as fast as broader categories. Strong double digit percentage sales growth saw record solar protection sales, driven by consumer preference for mineral-only sunscreens and greater use of UV filters in daily wear products, with sales particularly strong in Asia. We achieved our People Positive commitment of protecting 60 million lives globally through sun care solutions, seven years ahead of schedule. Alongside this success, the consumer shift to sustainable ingredients saw Croda expand its bio-based and milder surfactant portfolio, while Personal Care sales of ECO bio-based surfactants tripled in the year, supporting our ambition to eliminate petrochemical derived surfactants globally. New product launches included ChromaPur, a natural alternative to microbeads that contain microplastics and are currently used in a wide range of personal care products.\n\nF&F is focused on serving local customers in emerging markets, which are seeing the highest growth in fragrances. Sales grew by over 20%, with strong price recovery of raw material inflation. Innovation included bio-based fragrances and the launch of VernovaCaps, only the second biodegradable fragrance capsule on the market. The technology opens up encapsulated fragrances to customers beyond major global brands and has already been selected for fabric conditioners. The recent acquisition of Parfex has increased our presence in fine fragrances and our position in France. We have expanded our teams in Indonesia and South Africa, and launched a new F&F operation in Brazil, leveraging Croda's existing personal care strength. We are investing in China, already a significant fragrance market for Croda.\n\nFollowing some COVID-imposed delays, we are now driving integration synergies which will deliver nearly \u20ac50m of annual sales through combination with Croda's formulation capability. Home Care secured a new contract which will underpin growth in its core protein fabric technology and launched a microbial cleaning technology creating a new sustainable niche.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodegradable fragrance encapsulation\n\nFragrance encapsulation involves advanced delivery systems that allow the timed release of fragrances, critical in various applications such as laundry, fabric softeners and deodorants. After several years of innovation, in May 2022 our F&F business launched its new biodegradable fragrance capsules, known as VernovaCaps.\n\nIberchem's VernovaCaps are the second biodegradable fragrance encapsulation technology on the market and the only one with a biodegradability profile corresponding to the OECD's standards of 'readily biodegradable'. The new fragrance technology not only offers a high level of biodegradability but is also predominantly bio-based, marking a significant milestone in the sustainability development of our F&F business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan this QR code\n\nto read more",

Our technologies deliver the active, improve its efficacy and solve challenges of stability and sustainability in customer formulations. Our 'buy and build' approach to new technology platforms has made Life Sciences as important to Croda as Consumer Care.\n\nOur global footprint gives us presence in the major crop regions and access to leading pharma R&D. Our strength in North America and Western Europe is now leveraged through expansion in Asia and Latin America. Working as an innovation partner to the major crop science companies, we have also expanded with medium and smaller sized customers, especially local customers in Latin America, India and China. Our acquisition of research-focused Avanti in 2020 expanded our pharma customer base to span drug and vaccine discovery and clinical trial stages, alongside our established commercialisation business. These relationships extend beyond global brands to academia, start-ups and biotech, where significant breakthrough discovery happens.\n\nOur strategy is to expand Life Sciences to empower biologics delivery, enabling the move from small chemically synthesised molecules to large and complex biologics, a megatrend which is transforming the pharmaceutical market and which will transform agriculture. In Pharma, we focus on segments with the strongest growth and highest innovation needs, leveraging our delivery systems and technology platforms to create new solutions for customers. In Crop Care, we are reinforcing our leadership with sustainable solutions and leveraging our expertise to accelerate the transition to biologics, which will enable greater targeting of actives and reduced biodiversity impact.\n\nTo deliver this strategy, we are investing in innovation, knowledge and capacity. Our R&D investment is creating an extensive innovation pipeline. We are increasing our knowledge base in innovation, sales and manufacturing, co-investing with national governments who recognise the importance of biologics in the 21 st century. We are supplementing organic growth with acquisition of new technology platforms, building on the successful growth of our vaccine adjuvant platform, acquired in 2018 and already doubled in sales, and our lipid systems platform, acquired in 2020 and the first to deliver a commercial COVID-19 mRNA delivery system.\n\nLife Sciences targets high single digit percentage annual sales growth, with a return on sales over 30% over the medium-term.\n\n## Purpose:\n\n## Smart science to improve lives TM\n\nLife Sciences vision:\n\n## To empower biologics delivery\n\nStrategy to Expand to Grow Life Sciences\n\n## Pharma\n\n- \u00b7  Focus on delivery system niches with high development needs\n- \u00b7  Transition from ingredients supplier to systems provider\n\n## Crop Care\n\n- \u00b7  Reinforce leadership in sustainable delivery systems\n- \u00b7  Enable the transition to biopesticides\n\nInvest in innovation pipeline, knowledge and capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in organic expansion in Crop Care\n\nAtlox 4913 TM is valued by customers for creating stable dispersions in complex crop formulations, ensuring consistent distribution of actives and preventing formulation breakdown.

Sales increased by 19% and adjusted operating profit by 10%. Across the three businesses, Crop Protection led the way, with exceptional growth driven by double-digit percentage volume and price/ mix increases. Seed Enhancement, with its innovative microplastic-free product innovation, also grew sales by double-digit percentage. Croda Pharma consolidated on its stellar growth in 2021, with continued expansion in delivery systems in Protein/Small Molecule Delivery and for non-COVID nucleic acid applications.\n\nSector sales grew by 19% to \u00a3682.3m (2021: \u00a3572.3m) with performance strengthening in the second half of the year. Price/mix grew by 6%, while volume was 8% higher. Currency translation added 5% to overall sales growth. Adjusted operating profit increased by 10% to \u00a3229.4m (2021: \u00a3208.5.m), with IFRS operating profit also up 10% to \u00a3220.3m (2021: \u00a3201.0m). 2022's performance was achieved despite an anticipated near 40% decline in sales of lipid systems to our principal COVID-19 vaccine customers. With Crop Protection a larger proportion of the sales mix and normalising lipid systems margin, return on sales reduced to 33.6% (2021: 36.4%).\n\nCrop Protection was the standout business, delivering strong double digit percentage sales growth, with a combination of high global demand and significant commodity price inflation supporting value added crop treatments. Working in partnership with crop science customers and collaboratively to solve sustainability challenges and improve yields, our aspiration is to be Net Nature Positive by 2030. A particular area of focus is biodegradability to promote soil health, with a number of new biodegradable ingredients coming to market. Syngenta awarded Croda its 'Reduction in Carbon' supplier award, recognising the carbon benefits in use of Croda's products and the customer benefits from our sustainability strategy. We are investing to develop systems for next generation biopesticide delivery that use microbials and RNA, a market which is currently much smaller than conventional pesticides but is growing fast. Biologic actives are more complex and specific, meaning land treatment can be at a much lower level than conventional chemical pesticides.\n\nSeed Enhancement also delivered a double-digit percentage sales increase. As an innovation partner to leading seed companies, our range of microplasticfree seed coatings have been proven in field trials across a variety of vegetable and field crops, with all major customers and in all major regions. This is creating significant growth opportunities, with commercial sales in multiple field crops and vegetables already secured. The business delivered the first successful field trials in the Americas for drought-resistant seed coatings, helping farmers to reduce the negative impact from abiotic stress. It also developed a tailored treatment for potato seeds which have multiple sustainability benefits over potato tubers that farmers have traditionally used.\n\nIn 2022, our Health Care business was repositioned as 'Croda Pharma' to focus on segments with complex development requirements. The relaunch was accompanied by a new brand, organisational structure and governance for its exciting project and innovation pipelines. Protein/Small Molecule Delivery grew strongly, providing delivery systems for both mature small molecule drugs and higher growth protein and mAb applications. With 1,400 direct customers, the business is working on over a thousand customer projects across both clinical development and commercial supply. These include projects in several therapeutic areas, such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and cancer, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe. Strong demand in India will be supported by a new Pharma innovation centre opening soon in Hyderabad.",

It is also supporting many hundreds of pre-clinical and clinical projects, including new prophylactic vaccines driven by the WHO's immunisation agenda and novel therapeutic vaccines that fight already contracted disease. These include a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in phase III trials, a personalised cancer vaccine in clinical phase II development and a new vaccine for Ebola. The innovation pipeline is focused on the development of adjuvant systems to power the therapeutic vaccines of the future, leveraging expertise added with the Avanti acquisition and a new applications laboratory in Denmark.\n\nWith mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 having proven the viability of our Nucleic Acid Delivery business, the market for new drug and vaccine applications is developing fast, both for mRNA-based drugs and gene editing applications, which modify a patient's genetic material to correct a disorder. 2022 sales were approximately US$170m (2021: $230m), a little ahead of expectations. Sales outside the principal COVID-19 vaccine customers now represent almost 40% of business sales and are expected to be the majority of the $120m sales expected in 2023, as COVID-19 sales continue to decline. Supporting close to 100 nucleic acid drugs currently in development, including manufacturing materials for a phase III trial of a flu vaccine, combination vaccines, cancer immunotherapies and the world's first human trial of a gene therapy application, the pipeline for this business is strong.\n\nWe are investing in innovation, knowledge and capacity to broaden our footprint and capabilities in drug delivery, including new application laboratories aligned to each business. We have a \u00a3175m capital programme for the period 2021-24 to expand our Pharma capability, including the expansion of the US Avanti site into a full GMP facility, the expansion of our UK lipid scale up facility and the creation of a second US GMP scale up plant in Pennsylvania. Our investment is supported by up to an additional \u00a375m from the UK and US governments, in recognition of the importance of our delivery systems to future drug development and their pandemic preparedness plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting the next generation of therapeutic vaccines\n\nVaccine adjuvants are used to enhance immune response to an antigen, improving the overall efficacy of the vaccine and increasing protection against the target disease. Croda is the leading independent supplier of vaccine adjuvants with unrivalled breadth across aluminium, saponin and lipid based adjuvants.\n\nIn addition to traditional prophylactic (preventative) vaccines, our technology is enabling the next generation of therapeutic vaccines, used to combat an already contracted disease. These are typically higher value, requiring more advanced adjuvant systems. One of Croda's adjuvant systems is included in a personalised immunotherapy drug candidate, currently in phase II clinical trials. The vaccine, in combination with an inhibitor treatment, targets metastatic melanoma, a disease occurring when cancerous cells from the primary tumour spread, starting a new tumour elsewhere in the body.",

On an IFRS basis, profit before tax grew by 90%, which includes a significant gain on the business divestment.\n\n## Currency translation\n\nSterling weakened against the US Dollar to US$1.237 (2021: US$1.375) but was broadly flat against the Euro (\u20ac1.174 (2021: \u20ac1.164)). Currency translation benefitted sales by \u00a3100.6m and adjusted operating profit by \u00a319.6m. Transactional currency impact is correlated with translation, given that the UK and EU are meaningful centres of production for the Group, with the weakness of both Sterling and the Euro against the US Dollar having a net positive impact.\n\n## Impact of PTIC divestment\n\nThe Group received cash consideration of \u00a3651.0m, net of customary deductions, from the divestment of the majority of its PTIC business. The divestment generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of \u00a3356.0m which has been separately recognised in the Income Statement, within the Adjustments column. The divested business did not meet the requirements to be classified as a discontinued operation as Croda did not exit a geographical area of operation and it retained a proportion of the PTIC business, now reported as Industrial Specialties. In 2022, the revenue of Industrial Specialties was \u00a3509.2m and adjusted operating profit \u00a381.0m (with the prior period restated to combine the PT and IC segments, which were previously reported separately). Taking account of the sales and profit retained by Croda under supply agreements for products manufactured at Croda retained sites and supplied to the acquirer, together with dis-synergy costs remaining with Croda which were previously allocated to the divested business, the estimated impact of the divestment on these results, had disposal occurred on 1 January 2022, would have been to reduce revenue by \u00a3191m and adjusted operating profit by \u00a339m. Following the divestment, associated dis-synergy costs have been allocated across the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors. This reduced second half year return on sales in these two sectors by just under one percentage point compared with the prior year comparator period.\n\n## Strong sales from organic growth\n\nGroup sales grew by 10.6% to \u00a32,089.3m (2021: \u00a31,889.6m), comprising underlying growth of 4.6%, currency translation of 5.4% and acquisition impact of 0.6%. Within underlying growth, sales/price mix improved by 24.2%, reflecting the successful recovery of cost inflation and improved mix. By contrast, volume reduced by 19.6%, with an estimated 13 percentage points of the decline driven by the PTIC divestment, which resulted in lower sales in Industrial Specialties in the second half year.\n\nConsumer Care sales increased by 17.7%, with underlying sales 9.7% higher. Sales/price mix was strong, partly offset by volume which reduced due to a strong comparator period, de-marketing of lower margin products in light of capacity constraints and customer destocking in the second half of 2022. Life Sciences sales increased by 19.2%, with underlying sales 13.9% higher, supported by both price/mix and volume growth. Second half year growth accelerated in Life Sciences, with a good performance in Seed Enhancement complementing continued Crop Protection growth.\n\n| 2022 sales growth      |   First half % | Second half %   | Full year %   |\n|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Consumer Care          |           24   | 11.8            | 17.7          |\n| Life Sciences          |           13.5 | 25.1            | 19.2          |\n| Industrial Specialties |           23.9 | (40.0)          | (8.1)         |\n| Group                  |           20.7 | 0.7             | 10.6          |\n\n|                        | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Restated   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n| Sales growth           | 2022 \u00a3m                       | Price/mix                     | Volume                        | Acquisition                   | Currency                      | Change                        | 2021  \u00a3m   |\n| Consumer Care          | 897.8                         | 22.0%                         | (12.3)%                       | 1.5%                          | 6.5%                          | 17.7%                         | 763.0      |\n| Life Sciences          | 682.3                         | 5.7%                          | 8.2%                          | 0.0%                          | 5.3%                          | 19.2%                         | 572.3      |\n| Industrial Specialties | 509.2                         | 19.9%                         | (31.7)%                       | 0.0%                          | 3.7%                          | (8.1)%                        | 554.3      |\n| Group                  | 2,089.3                       | 24.2%                         | (19.6)%                       | 0.6%                          | 5.4%                          | 10.6%                         | 1,889.6    |",

        "page_content": "## Record Group profit delivery despite continued inflation\n\n2022 saw a second consecutive year of raw material inflation driven by global commodity prices and geopolitical events, with prices of the top 75% of raw materials up by 23%, in addition to the 17% rise seen in 2021. Raw material costs peaked in the third quarter of 2022 and have seen modest declines since. Operating costs were impacted by increasing inflation during 2022, most notably in energy and labour costs. Croda's powerful business model enabled overall inflation recovery, protecting absolute profit. Operating costs also benefitted from a lower variable remuneration charge, reflecting the impact of a lower share price on share scheme costs.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3444.7m (2021: \u00a3438.2m), the gain on the PTIC disposal was \u00a3356.0m and interest charge \u00a320.7m, giving a profit before tax of \u00a3780.0m (2021: \u00a3411.5m). Operating costs included a charge for other adjusting items of \u00a370.4m (2021: \u00a330.4m), reflecting an unchanged charge for amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of \u00a334.3m (2021: \u00a334.3m) and a charge for exceptional items of \u00a336.1m (2021: \u00a33.9m credit). In common with many companies, Croda separately identifies such items which require separate disclosure by virtue of their size or incidence. The charge for exceptional items comprised a gain on contingent consideration on a previous acquisition of \u00a36.1m and an impairment charge of \u00a342.2m, reflecting a \u00a334.6m write-down of goodwill in the Flavours cash generating unit, where forecast sales and margin are behind the acquisition case, reducing the future value projection, and a \u00a37.6m write-off of unusable manufacturing equipment in Japan. The adjusting charge within net interest relates to unwind of the discount on contingent consideration of \u00a31.7m (2021: \u00a33.3m).\n\nAdjusted operating profit, measured excluding the adjusting items above, increased by 9.9% to \u00a3515.1m (2021: \u00a3468.6m), reflecting the higher sales. Return on sales was broadly unchanged at 24.7% (2021: 24.8%), with an improved margin mix from the reduced share of industrial sales and the lower variable remuneration charge offset by normalisation of the Life Sciences margin, after an exceptional 2021, and a lower Consumer Care margin due to the operating gearing effect of lower volume and a weaker product mix. Adjusted profit before tax increased by 11.4% to \u00a3496.1m (2021: \u00a3445.2m)\n\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted profit was 22.8% (2021: 21.2%), the prior year having benefitted from a one-off benefit from settlement of a previously uncertain tax position. The effective tax rate on IFRS profit was 16.2% (2021: 21.6%), the lower rate reflecting corporate tax exemptions available on the PTIC divestment. There were no significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported tax charge based on its accounting profit. IFRS basic earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to 465.8p (2021: 230.0p), while adjusted basic EPS increased by 8.8% to 272.0p (2021: 250.0p).\n\n## Growing sector profits\n\nConsumer Care adjusted operating profit grew by 8.6%, driven by higher sales but at a lower margin, reflecting lower volume and an adverse business mix. Life Sciences adjusted operating profit grew by 10.0%, despite the prior year being buoyed by exceptional demand for COVID-19 vaccines, with sales growing in the rest of the Pharma business and in Crop Care. Industrial Specialties profit grew by 13.1%, a strong result given the business was significantly smaller, following the divestment of the majority of the business in June 2022 (with the second half of 2021 estimated to have benefitted from \u00a327m of adjusted operating profit from the divested business (compared to \u00a3nil in the second half of 2022)). Group profit growth reflected underlying growth and currency translation benefit across all sectors, with no material impact from acquisitions (covering the first 12 months of ownership).\n\n|                           | 2022      | 2022            | 2022        | 2021     | 2021           | 2021         |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------|----------------|--------------|\n| Sales and profit          | IFRS  \u00a3m  | Adjustments  \u00a3m | Adjusted \u00a3m | IFRS  \u00a3m | Adjustments \u00a3m | Adjusted  \u00a3m |\n| Sales                     | 2,089.3   | -               | 2,089.3     | 1,889.6  | -              | 1,889.6      |\n| Cost of sales             | (1,103.7) | -               | (1,103.7)   | (950.7)  | -              | (950.7)      |\n| Gross profit              | 985.6     | -               | 985.6       | 938.9    | -              | 938.9        |\n| Operating costs           | (540.9)   | (70.4)          | (470.5)     | (500.7)  | (30.4)         | (470.3)      |\n| Operating profit          | 444.7     | (70.4)          | 515.1       | 438.2    | (30.4)         | 468.6        |\n| Gain on business disposal | 356.0     | 356.0           | -           | -        | -              | -            |\n| Net interest charge       | (20.7)    | (1.7)           | (19.0)      | (26.7)   | (3.3)          | (23.4)       |\n| Profit before tax         | 780.0     | 283.9           | 496.1       | 411.5    | (33.7)         | 445.2        |\n| Tax                       | (126.7)   | (13.8)          | (112.9)     | (88.7)   | 5.7            | (94.4)       |\n| Profit after tax          | 653.3     | 270.1           | 383.2       | 322.8    | (28.0)         | 350.8        |\n\n|                        | 2022     | 2022            | 2022        | 2021 restated   | 2021 restated   | 2021 restated   |\n|------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Operating profit       | IFRS  \u00a3m | Adjustments  \u00a3m | Adjusted \u00a3m | IFRS  \u00a3m        | Adjustments \u00a3m  | Adjusted  \u00a3m    |\n| Consumer Care          | 144.5    | (60.2)          | 204.7       | 168.0           | (20.5)          | 188.5           |\n| Life Sciences          | 220.3    | (9.1)           | 229.4       | 201.0           | (7.5)           | 208.5           |\n| Industrial Specialties | 79.9     | (1.1)           | 81.0        | 69.2            | (2.4)           | 71.6            |\n| Group                  | 444.7    | (70.4)          | 515.1       | 438.2           | (30.4)          | 468.6           |\n\n|                        | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Adjusted profit        | 2022 \u00a3m                       | Underlying  growth  \u00a3m        | Acquisition  impact  \u00a3m       | Currency  impact  \u00a3m          | Restated   2021  \u00a3m           | Change                        |\n| Consumer Care          | 204.7                         | 8.8                           | 0.7                           | 6.7                           | 188.5                         | 8.6%                          |\n| Life Sciences          | 229.4                         | 9.8                           | 0.0                           | 11.1                          | 208.5                         | 10.0%                         |\n| Industrial Specialties | 81.0                          | 7.6                           | 0.0                           | 1.8                           | 71.6                          | 13.1%                         |\n| Operating profit       | 515.1                         | 26.2                          | 0.7                           | 19.6                          | 468.6                         | 9.9%                          |\n| Net interest           | (19.0)                        |                               |                               |                               | (23.4)                        | (18.9)%                       |\n| Profit before tax      | 496.1                         |                               |                               |                               | 445.2                         | 11.4%                         |",

        "page_content": "## Finance review continued\n\nThe phasing of return on sales between the first and second half years reflected normal seasonality, together with a lower margin in Consumer Care in the second half year due to the dilution effect of lower volume and business mix.\n\n| 2022 return on sales   |   First half % |   Second half % |   Full year % |\n|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Consumer Care          |           26.6 |            18.9 |          22.8 |\n| Life Sciences          |           36   |            31.4 |          33.6 |\n| Industrial Specialties |           17.7 |            12.3 |          15.9 |\n| Group                  |           26.6 |            22.3 |          24.7 |\n\n## Improving free cashflow\n\nFree cash flow was \u00a3167.4m (2021: \u00a3153.6m), with working capital improving, as expected, in the second half year as raw material inflation peaked, resulting in a reduction in inventory and receivables values. Nevertheless, average values remained elevated at year end; of the \u00a3133.8m increase in working capital during the year, approximately \u00a382m reflected the impact of inflation at a 'constant days cover'. The remaining \u00a352m reflected investment for growth, primarily higher receivables. Net capital expenditure was \u00a3138.5m (2021: \u00a3158.5m), driving future growth opportunities and supported by government funding grants in the Pharma business. Investment was behind expectation, with some supply chain challenges, but is expected to recover the shortfall in 2023, in line with our plans.\n\nClosing net debt was \u00a3295.2m (2021: \u00a3823.2m), benefitting from disposal proceeds. The leverage ratio reduced to 0.5x EBITDA (2021: 1.4x). As at 31 December 2022, the Group had committed funding in place of \u00a31,122.5m, with undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3579.3m and \u00a3320.6m in cash.\n\n## Assessing evolving risks\n\nThe Group conducts scenario modelling as part of its viability and going concern evaluation, to evaluate the impact of uncertainties, continually reassessing evolving risks and their impact on the Group's strategy. These scenarios highlighted the resilience of the Group and its ability to withstand unexpected shocks.\n\n## Effective capital allocation\n\nThe divestment has released capital to be reinvested in faster growth markets, further developing our sustainability leadership in consumer care and crop care markets, whilst increasing our presence in pharmaceutical delivery systems. We are prioritising organic capital investment to create new technology platforms and expand capacity for future growth. This will be complemented with inorganic investment, where we can acquire complementary businesses and organically invest in them to grow, in line with our 'buy and build' model.\n\nThese elements are reflected in the Group's capital allocation policy, to:\n\n- 1. Reinvest for growth - investment in organic capital expenditure to drive shareholder value creation through new capacity, product innovation and expansion in attractive geographic markets to drive sales and profit growth;\n- 2. Provide regular returns to shareholders - pay a regular dividend to shareholders, representing 40 to 50% of adjusted earnings over the business cycle. The full year dividend has been raised by 8% to 108.0p (2021: 100.0p);\n- 3. Acquire disruptive technologies - to supplement organic growth, we are targeting a number of exciting technology acquisitions in existing and adjacent markets, with a focus on strengthening our Consumer Care business and expanding in Life Sciences; and\n- 4. Maintain an appropriate balance sheet and return excess capital maintain an appropriate balance sheet to meet future investment and trading requirements, targeting a leverage ratio of 1 to 2x over the medium-term cycle. We consider returning excess capital to shareholders when leverage falls below our target range and sufficient capital is available to meet our investment opportunities.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe post-tax asset on retirement benefit plans at 31 December 2022, measured on an accounting valuation basis under IAS19, was \u00a375.2m (2021: \u00a35.8m), with the surplus primarily reflecting higher discount rates. Cash funding of the various plans is driven by the schemes' ongoing actuarial valuations. The triennial actuarial valuation of the largest pension plan, the UK Croda Pension Scheme, was performed as at 30 September 2020 and indicated that the scheme was 101% funded on a technical provisions basis. Consequently, no deficit recovery plan is required. Although the UK scheme utilises a Liability Driven Investment (LDI) structure, its gearing level is modest and no solvency issues were encountered during the UK gilt 'crisis' during September 2022.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nOn 3 February 2023, we agreed to acquire Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium, biotechnology-derived beauty actives, from Solus Advanced Materials for a total consideration of KRW350bn (approximately \u00a3232m) on a debt-free, cash-free basis. Employing 95 people in South Korea, Solus expands Croda's Asian manufacturing capability and will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. The business generated approximately KRW43bn (c.\u00a328m) of sales in 2022. The pending acquisition will provide access to Solus' existing biotech-derived ceramide and phospholipid technologies, and its emerging capabilities in natural retinol, and will enhance and complement Beauty Actives portfolio and increase our exposure to targeted prestige segments. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and will be funded from cash and debt facilities.\n\n|                                                      | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash flow                                            | 2022  \u00a3m                      | 2021  \u00a3m                      |\n| Adjusted operating profit                            | 515.1                         | 468.6                         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                        | 86.4                          | 79.0                          |\n| EBITDA                                               | 601.5                         | 547.6                         |\n| Working capital                                      | (133.8)                       | (102.5)                       |\n| Net capital expenditure                              | (138.5)                       | (158.5)                       |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                         | (17.4)                        | (14.4)                        |\n| Non-cash pension expense                             | 4.5                           | 11.2                          |\n| Interest & tax                                       | (148.9)                       | (129.8)                       |\n| Free cash flow                                       | 167.4                         | 153.6                         |\n| Dividends                                            | (144.4)                       | (132.5)                       |\n| Acquisitions                                         | (21.2)                        | (58.8)                        |\n| Business disposal net of cash in disposed businesses | 579.0                         | -                             |\n| Other cash movements                                 | (18.5)                        | 19.0                          |\n| Net cash flow                                        | 562.3                         | (18.7)                        |\n| Net movement in borrowings                           | (381.8)                       | 37.6                          |\n| Net movement in cash and cash equivalents            | 180.5                         | 18.9                          |",

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)\n\nWe use a number of APMs to assist in presenting information in this report in an easily analysable and comparable form. We use such measures consistently at the half year and full year, and reconcile them as appropriate. Whilst the Board believes the APMs used provide a meaningful basis upon which to analyse the Group's financial performance and position, which is helpful to the reader, it notes that APMs have certain limitations, including the exclusion of significant recurring items, and may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe measures used in this report include:\n\n- \u00b7 Constant currency results: these reflect current year performance for existing business translated at the prior year's average exchange rates and include the impact of acquisitions. Constant currency results are the primary measure used by management to monitor the performance of overseas business units, since they remove the impact of currency translation into Sterling, the Group's reporting currency, over which those overseas units have no control. Constant currency results are similarly useful to shareholders in understanding the performance of the Group excluding the impact of movements in currency translation over which the Group has no control. Constant currency results are reconciled to reported results in the Finance Review. The APMs are calculated as follows:\n- \u00b7  For constant currency profit, translation is performed using the entity reporting currency;\n- \u00b7  For constant currency sales, local currency sales are translated into the most relevant functional currency of the destination country of sale (for example, sales in Latin America are primarily made in US dollars, which is therefore used as the functional currency). Sales in functional currency are then translated into Sterling using the prior year's average rates for the corresponding period;\n- \u00b7 Underlying results: these reflect constant currency values adjusted to exclude acquisitions in the first year of impact. They are used by management to measure the performance of each sector before the benefit of acquisitions are included, in order to assess the organic performance of the sector, thereby providing a consistent basis on which to make year-on-year comparisons. They are seen as similarly useful to shareholders in assessing the performance of the business. Underlying results are reconciled to reported results in the Finance Review;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted results: these are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors' view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence. Movements in contingent consideration have been presented as exceptional as they are not directly representative of the underlying business performance in the period and therefore this presentation provides a meaningful basis to make comparisons between reporting periods. The gain on business disposal and impairment charges have been presented as exceptional due to their size and one-off nature. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the columnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons.\n\nThe same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results;\n\n- \u00b7 Return on sales: this is adjusted operating profit divided by sales, at reported currency. Management uses the measure to assess the profitability of each sector and the Group, as part of its drive to grow profit by more than sales value, in turn by more than sales volume, as set out in the Group Performance Review;\n- \u00b7 Return on invested capital (ROIC): this is adjusted operating profit after tax divided by the average adjusted invested capital. Adjusted invested capital represents net assets adjusted for net debt, earlier goodwill written off to reserves and accumulated amortisation of acquired intangible assets. Calculations and reconciliations are provided in the five year record of the Group's Annual Report. The Board believes that ROIC is a key measure of efficient capital allocation, in line with its policy set out in the Finance Review, with its aim being to maintain a ROIC of two to three times the cost of capital over the cycle, and that it is useful to shareholders in assessing the returns delivered by the Group and the impact of deploying more capital to grow future returns faster;\n- \u00b7 Net debt: comprises cash and cash equivalents (including bank overdrafts), current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities. Management uses this measure to monitor debt funding levels and compliance with the Group's funding covenants which also use this measure. It believes that net debt is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7 Leverage ratio: this is the ratio of net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted to include EBITDA from acquisitions or disposals in the last 12 month period calculated in line with the banking covenant definition. EBITDA is adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation. Calculations and reconciliations are provided in the five year record of the Group's Annual Report. The Board monitors the leverage ratio against the Group's debt funding covenants and overall appetite for funding risk, in approving capital expenditure and acquisitions. It believes that the APM is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow: comprises EBITDA less movements in working capital, net capital expenditure, payment of lease liabilities, non-cash pension expense, and interest and tax payments. The Board uses free cash flow to monitor the Group's overall cash generation capability, to assess the ability of the Company to pay dividends and to finance future expansion, and, as such, it believes this is useful to shareholders in their assessment of the Group's performance;\n- \u00b7 New and Protected Products (NPP) : these are products which are protected by virtue of being either newly launched, protected by intellectual property or by unique quality characteristics. NPP is used by management to measure and assess the level of innovation across the Group.",

Other metrics relevant to the implementation of our strategy, including our sustainability strategy, are shown across the bottom.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n## Scope 1 & 2 emissions 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition:\n\nOur operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (associated with burning fuels onsite and purchased electricity) in absolute terms.\n\n## Target:\n\nBy 2030, we will have achieved our Science Based Target, reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46.2% from a 2018 baseline.\n\n## Performance:\n\nSince 2018, our baseline year, our total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have reduced by 19.8%. Within this, scope 1 emissions have increased by 6% and we have seen a 77% reduction in scope 2 emissions. This has been driven by a switch to renewable electricity across our manufacturing sites. We remain on track to achieve our Science Based Target, reducing our emissions in line with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. For more detail see pages 23-25 of our Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. We have restated our historical scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions, removing the divested PTIC operations. Our carbon reduction targets have been re-baselined to ensure our level of ambition remains unchanged. Read more on page 40 of our Sustainability Report.\n\n## Progress against our Commitment in 2022\n\n## Climate Positive\n\nWe continue to deliver absolute scope 1 and 2 emission reductions in line with the trajectory of our Science Based Target (SBT) and have seen the first scope 1 reductions in 2022 arising from new decarbonisation investment. However, our Climate Positive ambition goes beyond decarbonising our own operations and supply chain, aiming for our products to help customers and consumers avoid four times the carbon emissions (scope 1, 2 & upstream scope 3) associated with our business (our Carbon Cover ratio) by 2030. In 2022, 687,926 tonnes CO2e were avoided through the use of our ingredients, giving a carbon cover ratio of 0.66:1. Additionally, by 2030, over 75% of our raw materials by weight will be bio-based, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere as they grow. On an ongoing basis (adjusting for the divestment of PTIC) our bio-based raw materials as a proportion of total volumes increased from 57% to 59% in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition:\n\nLand area saved through the application of our crop protection and seed enhancement technologies, using 2019 as our baseline year.\n\n## Target:\n\nThroughout this decade, the land saved through the application of our technologies will exceed any increase in land used to grow our raw materials by at least a factor of two, and by 2030 we will save a minimum 200,000 hectares per year more than in 2019.\n\n## Performance:\n\nIn 2022 the use of our agricultural ingredients and new technologies saved 53,486 hectares of land compared to our 2019 baseline of 92,223 hectares, translating to a total land saving of 145,709 hectares in 2022. We remain on track to hit our 2024 intermediate milestone of saving at least 80,000 hectares per year more than in 2019, and our 2030 target of saving 200,000 hectares per year more than in 2019.

Read more on page 90 of the 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## Land Positive\n\nCompared to our 2019 baseline we have saved 53,486 hectares of land through the application of our technologies. In addition to the land saved target we aim to bring an average of two crop technological breakthroughs to market each year until 2030. In 2022, we brought two such innovations to market which protect biodiversity and mitigate the impact of changing climate and land degradation, bringing our total launched since 2020 to four. We acknowledge that our business activities have impacts on nature and are committed to addressing them, announcing in 2022 our aspiration to be Net Nature Positive by 2030. As a member of the Science Based Target Network corporate engagement programme, we have worked in 2022 to better understand how each of our major manufacturing sites, key bio-based raw materials and crop and seed technologies positively or negatively impact biodiversity and nature.",

        "page_content": "## Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) Score\n\n## 68%\n\nIn 2022 we started to measure employees' engagement with our Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC), leading to the creation of the PSC score. This is used internally to understand employee sentiment and how we can make Croda a better place to work, and will be reported as a non-financial KPI in future years. Further detail on the implementation of the PSC score can be found on page 20.\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe PSC score is a gauge of employee satisfaction measured through employee surveys and expressed as a percentage.\n\n## Target:\n\nImprove the PSC score by 8 percentage points against the 2022 baseline by 2025.\n\n## Performance:\n\nOur baseline score for 2022 is 68%, with a participation rate of nearly 80%. The overall score is 'good' with encouraging scores in areas such as employees enjoying their work and those who would recommend Croda as a great place to work. There are areas that require improvement, including colleagues feeling their workload is manageable and ensuring we learn from mistakes without placing blame.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People Positive\n\nOur People Positive commitment impacts both our employees and wider society. In 2022, through the use of our solar protection ingredients, Croda contributed to protecting more than 61 million people from potentially developing skin cancer caused by harmful UV rays. This is seven years earlier than our 2030 target to protect at least 60 million people annually. We are also moving closer to our target of contributing to the successful development and commercialisation of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines and have achieved our 2024 milestone of ten clinical phase III trials two years ahead of schedule. Having established Croda Foundation in 2021 to help sustainably improve one million lives, by the end of 2022, 300,000 lives had been sustainably improved with 14.9 million lives benefitting in some way from Croda Foundation projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total recordable injury rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe number of incidents per 200,000 hours worked where a person has sustained an injury, including all lost time, restricted work and medical treatment cases (excludes COVID-19 cases).\n\n## Target:\n\nAchieve TRIR of 0.3 by the end of 2024.\n\n## Performance:\n\nThe headline TRIR decreased marginally to 0.74 (2021: 0.76 restated). Injury rates at the sites of recently acquired businesses are typically higher than established Croda sites and the underlying TRIR excluding sites acquired less than three years ago is 0.63. Reducing injury rates at both existing Croda sites and newly acquired sites is a top priority. Read more about performance and safety initiatives on page 21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fundamentals\n\nThe Fundamentals element of our Commitment represents the social licence required for a multinational company such as Croda to operate in 2030. Across the nine Fundamental objectives, we have identified some notable activities and progress in 2022. To enable us to meet our personal safety targets, we focused attention on the theme of 'Safety is a Value' with leadership teams across Croda. In a year where cost-of-living dominated public discussion around the globe, we confirmed that all employees globally receive the Living Wage in their country as a minimum and began the process of ensuring all our regular contractors are paid a Living Wage to meet our 2024 milestone. We updated our Supplier Code of Conduct and introduced Supplier Scorecards to raise the profile of environmental integrity and social accountability in our upstream supply chains, and are working with several supply chain consortia to increase transparency and drive action to improve environmental and social outcomes particularly for farmers in our crop-based supply chains.",

Measuring NPP is our established KPI for innovation. Historically the KPI has been defined as sales from NPP as a proportion of total sales in constant currency.\n\nThe list of New and Protected Products is reviewed annually, in line with the Group's policy. This process is overseen by a non-Executive Director before approval by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Target:\n\nWe seek to drive NPP sales growth at least as fast as total sales over the cycle, targeted at mid to high single digit percentage growth.\n\n## Delivering innovation in 2022\n\nOur innovation partners are a core part of our innovation ecosystem and our collaboration with universities and SMEs helps drive innovation and grow NPP sales. We continue to build our Open Innovation network, particularly in priority areas such as Pharma, and in 2022 added 11 innovation partners and initiated 10 innovation projects. Our Open Innovation network is global, with new innovation partners in Brazil, South Africa and India, as well as a growing network in the United States, enabling us to leverage the ideas, expertise and resources that exist in all regions.\n\nInnovation priorities include investing in biotechnology and sustainable chemistry, and accelerating the delivery of platform technologies in areas such as synthetic biology, biocatalysis, and downstream processing. Biotech innovation is led by five specialist biotechnology facilities, with increasing expertise and better collaboration from across the Group leading to the launch of novel ingredients that are derived from plant and marine sources. As we pursue more sustainable manufacturing processes, while continuing to meet performance expectations, in 2022 we acquired intellectual property that will help us transition to manufacturing key Beauty Actives ingredients using more sustainable techniques.\n\n## Open innovation partners and initiated projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance:\n\nThe proportion of sales from NPP has grown over the last decade from 20.5% in 2012. There was a significant increase in 2021 to 36.6% following the Avanti and Iberchem acquisitions, and strong sales of lipid systems for COVID-19 applications. The small reduction to 34.7% in 2022 reflects lower lipid systems sales and strong growth in Crop Protection which has a lower proportion of NPP.\n\nNPP is a KPI that is used for remuneration. Going forwards, the NPP measure will focus on growth in NPP over the performance period, rather than growth relative to non-NPP sales. As well as simplifying the measure, the new approach reflects the importance of our non-NPP sales, especially those relating to sustainable products. In 2022, NPP sales grew at 2.6% in constant currency, adjusting for the impact of the PTIC divestment.\n\nRead more about the important role that innovation plays in creating new market and technology niches on pages 22 and 23.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Underlying growth was principally driven by price/mix, with successful recovery of input cost inflation more than offsetting volume declines that were principally driven by the PTIC divestment.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control policies, procedures and systems.\n\n## Risk monitoring\n\nGlobal visibility of risks identified by regions, sites and sectors is obtained through bottom-up risk registers that are continuously updated in our risk and control system. Using our global risk management framework (page 53), bottom-up risks are combined with top-down risks, the latter being identified and owned by a member of the Executive Committee, in our Executive Risk Register.\n\nMovements to the Executive Risk Register are reviewed by the Risk Committee during quarterly meetings, that also have standing agenda items to review and monitor internal and external emerging risks; IT and cyber risks; internal audit and safety, health, environmental (SHE) and quality (SHEQ) assurance. The Committee also provides the Board with visibility of the principal risks facing the organisation through quarterly reports.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWhile our Board owns and oversees our risk management programme, risk management accountability is embedded throughout our organisation:\n\n- \u00b7  Our first line of defence, our employees, have a responsibility to manage day-to-day risk in their own areas guided by Group policies, procedures, control frameworks and risk appetite. Local management, and ultimately the Executive, ensure that risks are managed and actioned according to these frameworks\n- \u00b7  The second line of defence is provided by management team review of each risk register, culminating in review by the Risk Committee\n- \u00b7  The third line of defence is through assurance over the effectiveness of mitigating controls, which is provided through internal audits, supplemented by reports from external assurance providers\n- \u00b7  Our Global Crisis Management Plan is in place to manage significant risk events, is owned by the Executive Committee, and is tested at least annually using risk scenarios.\n- \u00b7  Croda's Group Fraud Policy, Group Code of Conduct, Group Code of Ethics and Group Whistleblowing Policy in addition to our controls framework are in place to prevent and detect fraud. Annually the Audit Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of Company's anti-fraud procedures\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite is the level of risk that Croda is willing to accept in the pursuit of a specific objective or strategy. We define a risk appetite score for each risk subcategory, using a one ('risk averse') to six ('risk open') scale. The risk subcategory for SHE sits at the lower end of the scale, meaning that we are not willing to accept risks of this nature and these must be reduced to a level as low as reasonably practical. At the other end of the scale sits the subcategory for innovation, an area where we are willing to accept risks to seize significant opportunities. Assessing risks against our risk appetite allows us to review and challenge the level of risk that we are taking for each of our key risks, to identify areas where additional controls may be needed, or where the level of control may be too onerous.\n\nOur risk appetite statements are compiled based on our Company values, strategy and capacity to absorb risk. We use our risk appetite statements as an effective tool to communicate the Company's appetite towards each type of risk, providing a consistent guidance for decision-making throughout the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our risk management framework See page 53\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our approach to managing climate-related risks See page 62\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nWe consider emerging risks and opportunities as part of our risk landscape and define them as those whose effects have not yet been substantially realised and which evolution is highly uncertain.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews emerging risks and opportunities from internal and external sources on its quarterly meetings and consider whether they should be included in our risk register.\n\nEmerging risks can be slow moving, when they have potential to materialise in more than a year, as well as rapid velocity, those that may materialise within the next year. The later are closely monitored and actively managed (see Energy crisis case study on page 54).",

        "page_content": "## Risk continued\n\n## Principal risks\n\nWe consider principal risks to be those risks, or combination of risks, that, were they to arise and not be effectively mitigated, would cause serious disruption to our business model, threatening future performance, solvency, liquidity or our ability to deliver our strategy. Risks at this level are recorded in our Executive Risk Register with a high pre-control score.\n\nThe Group's principal risks, as reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, were revenue generation; product and technology innovation and protection; digital technology innovation; delivering sustainable solutions - Climate and Land Positive; management of business change; our people - culture, wellbeing, talent development and retention; product quality; loss of significant manufacturing site; ethics and compliance; and security of business information and networks. During our periodic risk reviews, we confirmed that all principal risks reported in 2021 remain relevant and no new principal risks were identified. The following principal risks were identified as heightened relative to 2021:\n\n- \u00b7  Revenue generation: This risk has increased in likelihood and impact as greater geopolitical instability, rising inflation and slowing economic growth increased uncertainty. Our powerful business model has allowed us to continue to manage this risk effectively by recovering the significant inflation that persisted throughout 2022. After a period of strong market growth, there are some signs of macroeconomic slowdown in some regions facing a cost of living squeeze, which could impact our ability to deliver short-term growth in consumer-facing markets. More detail on this can be read in the case study on the right of this page.\n- \u00b7  Security of business information and networks: The conflict in Ukraine highlights the increased risk of geopolitical disputes. One impact of this can be an increase in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, increasing risk to computer networks and systems.\n- \u00b7  Our people - culture, wellbeing, talent development and retention: Competitive labour markets and the cost-of-living crisis in some regions increase the risk of not attracting and retaining necessary talent. To successfully control that risk, we are investing in talent development, enhanced benefits according to regional needs and providing financial support to counter the increase in employees' cost of living.\n\nThe following principal risk was identified as having reduced relative to 2021:\n\n- \u00b7  Loss of significant manufacturing site (major safety or environmental incident): This risk has decreased after the successful divestment of two of our large industrial sites in 2022, reducing the number of high hazard processes within the Company. In addition, capital investments in several sites in more sustainable and safer technologies, such as biofuel steam raising boilers which displace natural gas, and the introduction of continuous processes which are inherently safer and more efficient than old batch technologies, have also contributed.\n\n## Business model resilience in an inflationary economy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the conflict in Ukraine, created an environment of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Stressed supply chains, high inflation, slowing economic growth and increasing geopolitical tensions are a few of the resulting factors with the potential to impact the performance of businesses, including Croda.\n\nCroda's revenue and profit across all sectors and regions in 2022 give us confidence in the resilience of our business model. During the year, we were able to recover increases in raw material, freight, energy and employee costs. This shows that, in most cases, we can protect our profitability in an inflationary environment as our business model doesn't rely on a small number of customers and products but on a broad range of technologies that serve multiple niche markets where our leadership in innovation and sustainability is more important than prices.\n\n## Energy crisis\n\nUncertainty concerning the gas supply to Europe has led to high energy prices with risk of gas and the threat of energy rationing in several European countries. We evaluated the risk for a scenario of limited gas supply and periods of energy blackout during winter months considering:\n\n- \u00b7  The operation of our potentially affected manufacturing sites, IT systems and offices\n- \u00b7  Our raw material security, considering location of key suppliers\n- \u00b7  Rising energy cost impacts on our employees and potential disruption of social services (e.g. schools closing early).\n\nWe have also considered opportunities arising from competitors located in areas of higher likelihood of being affected.\n\nConsidering the impact and likelihood of this scenario, we did not classify it as a principal risk but as an emerging risk. A key risk indicator was defined and has been continuously monitored to determine the velocity of the risk. In case it achieves the defined threshold, it will trigger our Crisis Management Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on principal risks See pages 55-58",

To grow, we need to innovate and also keep pace with our customers as they serve consumers globally in established markets and higher risk developing markets. Failure to manage these challenges and the consequences of geopolitical tensions will adversely impact delivery of our growth strategic objective. Acquisitions of adjacent technologies will dilute growth if they are not effectively integrated.\n\n## How we respond\n\nThrough our global sector sales, marketing and technology teams, we identify consumer trends and respond swiftly to satisfy customer needs through key technologies. Our direct selling model enhances customer intimacy. Our resilient business model and continued focus on growing profit ahead of sales ahead of volume mitigates profit impact in difficult trading conditions.\n\nOur technical research and development (R&D) teams, based in our customer innovation centres and application laboratories globally, focus innovation on customer and market needs and are embedded across our business. We invest in: R&D, Open Innovation and Smart Partnership programmes, developing premium niches and disruptive technology acquisitions. Our specialist IP team protects new products and technologies, defending our IP and challenging third-party IP where appropriate.\n\n## What we have done in 2022\n\n- \u00b7  Commissioned a manufacturing facility in Brazil for F&F, one of the largest markets for fragrances globally\n- \u00b7  Extended the geographical reach of recent acquisitions Alban Muller and Parfex, leveraging the wider Consumer Care sales network\n- \u00b7  Educated our selling teams in the technologies that will deliver growth in our Pharma business over the coming years, developing a pipeline of projects across the globe\n- \u00b7  Invested in capital expenditure for growth at our manufacturing sites, specifically in high value technologies\n- \u00b7  Developed our expertise in long-term innovation allowing the continued development of new technology platforms in sustainable polymers and novel actives, as well as identifying four specific big bet projects representing near-term opportunities underpinned by these platforms\n- \u00b7  Invested in new technical resources, capabilities and locations supporting the development of our Pharma business in the areas of nucleic acid delivery, small molecule/ protein delivery and vaccine adjuvants\n- \u00b7  Further developed our approach to sustainable innovation leading to practical outcomes in market-led ingredient development with improved biodegradability, increased bio-based content and lower environmental impact\n\n## 2. Product and technology innovation and protection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nick Challoner\n\nGroup Chief Scientific Officer\n\nInnovation is the lifeblood of our business. It plays a critical role across our operations; it differentiates us from the competition, protects sales and improves our margins. Failure to leverage our global innovation teams could lead to a reduction in New and Protected Products (NPP) impacting growth and margin.\n\nFailure to protect our intellectual property (IP) in these products in existing and new markets could undermine our competitive advantage.",

        "page_content": "## Long-term viability statement\n\n## Confirmation of viability\n\nBased on their assessment of prospects and viability, the Directors confirm that they have an expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 31 December 2025. The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, as explained in the Group accounting policies (page 164).\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nWe assess viability through two lenses; a 'top-down' test which quantifies the magnitude of profit or loss required to endanger liquidity and our bank covenants and a 'bottom-up' assessment that makes use of downside scenario models, which reflect the key risks facing the Group, to test against the Group's financial headroom and leverage over the viability period.\n\nIn 2021, we adopted a new strategy to become a 'pure play' Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. With the intent to have a stable goal, we adopted 2026 as a fixed horizon for our annual strategic plan, with rolling three year detailed financial modelling being prepared. We chose to use a three year period for the viability assessment because, given the inherent uncertainty of long-term planning, we believe this is the horizon that provides the most appropriate balance between accuracy and long-term visibility.\n\nOur strategic plan is built from a bottom-up sector view considering different macroeconomic scenarios and near-term risk factors, including weaker demand, energy inflation, raw material price changes and ongoing pandemic restrictions. The base case model and downside scenarios are used to assess the impact for both the viability statement and the going concern assessments. For more on going concern see page 164.\n\n## Top-down liquidity headroom\n\nWe assess our overall capacity to withstand catastrophic events by stress testing the EBITDA reduction required to trigger a default under our funding covenants, and liquidity headroom available from committed debt facilities, including any which mature within the viability period:\n\n- \u00b7  Bank leverage covenant: the leverage ratio at the end of 2022 of 0.5x remains substantially below the maximum covenant level under the Group's debt facilities of 3.5x. Based on 2022 results, stress testing assesses that EBIT would need to fall by 99% to trigger an event of default. In the event that breaching the maximum covenant level was possible, we would also take additional unmodelled action to conserve cash and improve the covenant position (we also test the impact on our interest covenant; however, with a high level of fixed rate debt, there is no plausible scenario which endangers compliance with this covenant);\n- \u00b7  Unused committed liquidity headroom: as at 31 December 2022 over 95% of current committed debt facilities of \u00a31,122.5m mature after the end of the viability period, with current committed unused headroom of \u00a3579.3m (see financial review on page 44 for more details). The Company therefore expects to have the necessary liquidity headroom available to cope with unexpected risk events during the viability period.\n\n## Bottom-up risk scenario headroom\n\nUsing the 'base case' model, individual downside scenario events were identified and modelled. In addition, five severe but plausible combinations of these individual scenario events were tested to assess the potential combined downside impact on the liquidity and covenant headroom of the Group over the three-year viability period. None of the individual scenario or scenario combinations was found to endanger the liquidity or covenant requirements over the viability period.

We develop innovative products which help our customers to reduce their own carbon footprint and we set stretching climate related targets as part of our Climate Positive Commitment to 2030 (page 12).\n\nOn pages 60 to 68 of this report we summarise material climate related disclosures consistent with the four pillars and 11 disclosures proposed by the TCFD, including the 'Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' released in October 2021. We also reference links to further information which can be found in our Annual Report, Sustainability Report (SR) and online factsheets to support compliance. We cross refer to our Sustainability Report throughout this TCFD section as that report offers us additional space to explain our strategic Climate Positive commitment, illustrate this through case studies (SR pages 22-27) and explain our targets, metrics and progress in more detail (SR pages 36-39).

Minor Impact |\n| 3-4                 | Low - Moderate Impact      |\n| 5-6                 | High - Critical Impact     |\n\n## Building the scenarios:\n\nThe 2021 CSA model was used as a starting point with several steps taken to refine and refresh the analysis. The starting basis was updated to use actual financial and process data for 2021, re-baselined to remove the contribution of the majority Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business divested in June 2022 and include the climate footprint of businesses acquired in 2021. Multi-disciplinary workshop groups were convened to review the assumptions for forecasting our growth (using financial assumptions used in our strategic forecasting process), and our demands for each of raw materials, energy and people. The baseline for our energy estimates and site water use are taken from our non-financial reporting system, Sphera, which is fed with quarterly actual data from all our sites globally.\n\nModelled in conjunction with external scenario data from the NGFS, Orbitas Finance and SSP to forecast and quantify the potential levels of climate related financial risk in line with Croda's risk matrix, the results of our 2022 assessment are shared on pages 67 and 68.\n\nFor each transitional risk we also considered the impact under the assumption that Croda continues to operate as today (business as usual) and secondly that currently planned mitigating actions to meet our verified science based targets are successfully implemented. This clearly illustrates the significance of the mitigating steps Croda is taking.\n\nCroda climate scenario analysis has been conducted at an organisational level, however regions or sites that have material contributions to the overall risks have been identified, affording the opportunity to account for any dominant locations in the assumptions used.",

Our carbon reduction targets have been re-baselined to ensure our level of ambition remains unchanged (see non-financial data pack for details). Since 2018, our baseline year, our total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have reduced by 19.8%. Within this, scope 1 emissions increased by 6% and we have seen a greater than 77% reduction in scope 2 emissions. This has been driven by a switch to renewable electricity across our manufacturing sites.\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our UK operations were 17,271 TeCO2e in 2022 (2021: 17,168 TeCO2e) representing approximately 14% of our global GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2022, scope 3 emissions increased by 3% (see page 24 of our Sustainability Report for more detail).\n\n## Emissions verification\n\nOur scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions are verified by Avieco, part of Accenture.\n\n## Emissions intensity\n\nOur chosen measure of GHG emission intensity divides our GHG emissions (market-based scope 2 emissions) by value added 2 , a measure of our business activity. The GHG emission intensity for 2022 has been calculated using verified scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data and estimated value added if the PTIC divestment had completed on 1 January 2022. Results for 2018-2021 use actual value added and scope 1 and scope 2 emissions inclusive of the divested locations. On this basis, our GHG emissions intensity has improved by 56% since 2018, illustrating how we are decoupling growth from our environmental impact.\n\n## Energy consumption and efficiency improvements\n\nIn 2022 we consumed 875,545,599 kWh (2021: 864,679,531 kWh) of energy across our global operations. This included 112,990,828 kWh (2021: 113,325,570 kWh) consumed by UK operations.\n\nAs part of our strategy to improve the efficiency of energy consumption, 26 projects were implemented globally, realising 17,180,619 kWh of annualised efficiency improvements, equivalent to 2,767 TeCO2e avoided emissions.\n\n- 1. Our GHG inventory has been completed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) using the operational controls approach. Scope 1 emissions are calculated using UK Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting. Scope 2 emissions are market-based.\n- 2. Value added is defined as operating profit before depreciation and employee costs at reported currency.\n- 3. Our scope 3 emissions are calculated in accordance with The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Scope 3 standard and cover all relevant upstream categories. Scope 3 emissions are calculated using primarily LCA data, and where this is not available, an Extended Environmental Input-Output (EEIO) model method - using spend data, to quantify the emissions associated with a sector of the economy in a given geography.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on these bottom-up assessments, the Sustainability Committee complete an annual review and selected the four risks with the highest financial impact to investigate in more detail using scenario analysis. Based on the 2021 scenario analysis, the impact of climate on labour productivity was reduced, and this was not modelled in 2022. Following more detailed assessment undertaken throughout 2022, the impact of water usage was assessed as increased and therefore we have included water usage as a new scenario for assessment.

The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code for the period under review. The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Board's activity See pages 74-77\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on the search for our new Chief Financial Officer See page 94\n\n## Dear fellow shareholder\n\n## Board activity\n\nThe Board continued to oversee the delivery of the Group's five-year strategic plan, including taking part in two strategy sessions with the Executive Committee team. At its strategy session in June the Board focused on the foundational programmes that support the Group's strategy, including work on customer insights, business change, digital solutions and data and systems, what we call 'Doing the Basics Brilliantly'. The Board also reviewed the organic and inorganic investment opportunities in both our Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors. Further details can be found on page 77.\n\nOur success depends on our skilled and highly committed employees who are central in our decision-making process and throughout 2022 the Board met regularly with employees, through listening groups, Board presentations and site visits. Further details on how we engaged with our employees can be found on pages 84 and 85.\n\nThe Board remained focused on sustainability and achieving our ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients, becoming Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. The Board's involvement and oversight are described on page 81. With the increasing number and growing complexity of regulations in sustainability reporting, the Board is reviewing how it will continue to ensure that it has comfort that Croda is in compliance with relevant regulations and has assurance on the accuracy and reliability of climate-related and other sustainability disclosures, including oversight of the control environment in relation to information used in support of the disclosures. The Board is considering if this responsibility should remain with the Audit Committee or a separate Sustainability Oversight Committee should be established.\n\nDuring the year the Board spent time reviewing innovation. This included biotechnology in our Beauty Actives business and a review of the innovation pipeline for each platform within our Croda Pharma business. Our Chief Scientific Officer presented the innovation strategy to the Board. Details are set out on page 76.\n\nFurther information on the Board's deliberations in other areas, and how we consider the interests of our key stakeholders, is set out on pages 78 to 81.\n\nThe Chair of our Remuneration Committee, Jacqui Ferguson, undertook a consultation process with our major shareholders in relation to our proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy, which requires shareholder approval at our April 2023 AGM. Further details on the Remuneration Policy and the consultation process can be found on pages 108 to 121.",

        "page_content": "## Leadership and diversity\n\nDuring the year the Nomination Committee undertook a search for a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to succeed Jez Maiden who will retire from the Board at the AGM in April 2023.\n\nOn 1 January 2023 Louisa Burdett joined Croda and the Board. Louisa will succeed Jez as CFO on 13 March 2023, and Jez will step down from the Board at the AGM on 26 April 2023 and retire from the Company on 31 May 2023. On behalf of the Board and all my Croda colleagues, I would like to thank Jez for his outstanding contribution over the last eight years. Louisa has an exceptional ten-year track record as a CFO of listed companies, with valuable experience both in speciality chemicals and the broader manufacturing sector.\n\nThe Board has also commenced a search for a new Non-Executive Director to replace Helena Ganczakowski, who has reached her nine year tenure and will retire from the Board at the 2023 AGM.\n\nWe consider that creating an inclusive Board is essential in attracting a diverse set of candidates for Board roles. The greater the diversity of our Directors, the more likely we can foster innovative thinking in the Boardroom. I am happy to report that the composition of the Board continues not only to meet, but exceed, the ambitions set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review for FTSE 100 companies. We are also comfortably in line with the recent recommendations from the FTSE Women Leaders Review that listed companies should have at least one woman in the Chair or Senior Independent Director role on the Board and/or one woman in the Chief Executive Officer or Finance Director role by the end of 2025. Croda currently has two of these positions held by women and with the appointment of Louisa Burdett as CFO on 13 March 2023, three of these positions will be held by women.\n\nIn preparation for Helena's retirement, Jacqui Ferguson took over as Chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 September 2022. This ensured Jacqui had a good period as Chair to prepare for the review of the Company's Remuneration Policy. Jacqui has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since 1 September 2018. Helena will remain a member of the Remuneration Committee and will continue in her role as the Senior Independent Director until her retirement at the 2023 AGM. Jacqui Ferguson will succeed Helena as Senior Independent Director from the date of the AGM in 2023. Jacqui has four years' experience on the Board, building excellent relationships with her fellow Non-Executive Directors and the executive management team and has a detailed understanding of Croda, making her entirely suitable for this role.\n\nOur Group HR Director, Tracy Sheedy, will retire from the Executive Committee and the Company at the end of April after six years in the role. Tracy's successor, Michelle Lydon, was appointed as President Human Resources and a member of the Executive Committee on 1 January 2023 and will take over from Tracy in mid-March. Since joining Croda in 2016, Tracy has played an important role in our success and will leave a strong team of HR business partners and specialists, well equipped to support Croda's future needs. Michelle has wide-ranging experience as a HR Director gained at listed, global companies including most recently as Chief People Officer for British Airways and before that QinetiQ.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board agreed to extend my appointment for a further year. This extension is in line with our policy to review appointments annually once six years' tenure has been completed. John Ramsay completed his first three-year term and the Nomination Committee recommended to the Board that his appointment be extended for a further three years. Before making these recommendations to the Board, the Nomination Committee considered the contribution made to the Board and the Committees by the individuals and their time commitments. No Director being considered for re-appointment took part in any discussion relating to their own appointment. Further information about the tenure of other Board members can be found on page 95.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nI am pleased to report that the Board evaluation this year confirmed that we continue to operate as a very effective Board. Details of the Board's annual evaluation and future priorities for the Board are set out on pages 88 and 89. In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the next Board evaluation will be facilitated by an external party and details will be shared in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2023.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nWe know our AGM provides investors with a valuable opportunity to communicate with us and this dialogue is very important to the Board. The AGM will be held on 26 April 2023 and once again we are offering shareholders a choice to attend the AGM in person or view the AGM remotely via a webcast. More details of this event are set out in the Notice of Meeting and I would be delighted to see you, whether in person or online, and answer any questions that you may have.\n\nFinally, I would like to give thanks to my fellow Board members and all the people of Croda for their hard work, commitment and support during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDame Anita Frew DBE, Chair",

Safety is always the first matter he reports on with a focus on both employee behavioural safety and process safety issues. He will also report on the performance of each business, including sales and regional activity as well as competitor insights and performance. Market trends and opportunities are considered and any material dialogue with major customers, suppliers and regulatory bodies are discussed.\n\n## Approvals - current issues\n\nApprovals that form part of the matters reserved for the Board are sought from the Board in this part of the agenda.\n\nThis includes, for example, corporate transactions, capital expenditure, significant commercial contracts, the financial statements, dividends, the Group budget as well as a review of past capex and innovation performance. For example, during 2022 the Board:\n\n## Strategy - forward looking\n\nEach Board meeting agenda has strong links to the strategic objectives of the business.\n\nThese sessions ensure the Board understands the opportunities for the business in terms of new markets, technologies and disruptive innovation, as well as implications for talent. For example, during 2022 the Board undertook strategic deep dives into the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7  Beauty Actives - the Board heard from members of the Consumer Care team about the five-year plan for the Beauty Actives business, which included insights on market trends for premium skin care actives and fast growing market demand for botanical ingredients. The talent and expertise needed to deliver the strategy was discussed, including in areas such as biotechnology, as well as the key customer partnerships required to increase the growth of the skin care market in Asia.\n- \u00b7  Innovation strategy - the Chief Scientific Officer and members of his team updated the Board on R&D, open innovation and technology investments that were being used to increase differentiation and IP and to support growth in returns. The Board spent time discussing several technology platforms, including the sustainability of platforms to ensure the Group continued its ambitious journey of decarbonisation.\n- \u00b7  The Group Finance Director reports on monthly and year to date sales performance, profit, cash flow, cost base, capital expenditure and outlook for the year. He also reports during the year on performance against budget, dividends, treasury items, including liquidity, and keeps the Board abreast of investor discussions and feedback.\n- \u00b7  Each quarter the Board receives comprehensive reports from members of the Executive Committee in relation to all aspects of the business, including market sectors, regional delivery, sustainability, operations, innovation, people, risk and functional updates. This is in addition to the deep dive sessions covered under the Board's annual programme of business.\n- \u00b7  Approved capital investments in Lamar (Pennsylvania), Dahej (India), Singapore and a UK Pharma site, as well as funding and cooperation agreements with the UK and the US Governments.\n- \u00b7  Discussed two acquisition opportunities including the acquisition of the Korean based Solus Biotech.\n- \u00b7  Considered the Group's IT strategy, which included a focus on cyber risks with the Board challenging the robustness of the Group's capabilities to protect the business from exposure.\n- \u00b7  Croda Pharma pipeline review - the Board received a presentation from the President of Life Sciences and team members on the Croda Pharma innovation pipeline for each of the Croda Pharma platforms (Protein Delivery, Adjuvant Systems and Nucleic Acid Delivery), including the peak sales innovation pipeline and weighted value by 2030. The M&A opportunities for each platform were also discussed.\n- \u00b7  Talent - the Group HR Director facilitated an in-depth discussion on talent. This included the implications for talent in delivering the Group's strategic plans, such as attraction and retention of R&D skillsets, successful integration and understanding of talent within acquisitions and increased competition for talent within the industry. The Board noted the progress in improving inclusion and diversity and the development of a leadership values matrix assessing talent against Croda's core values of Together, Innovative and Responsible. An important element of the discussion centred around the succession pipeline for the Executive Director and the Executive Committee roles.",

In 2022 the Board focused on the foundational programmes that are vital in supporting the Group's strategy.\n\nThis included an in-depth review of work on customer insights, business change, digital solutions and data and systems. The strategy day comprised a series of short round robin presentations, with the Board and the Executive Committee broken up into four smaller mixed groups and moving from room to room. This format promotes discussion and debate and an opportunity for the management teams to use the Directors' experiences to build upon and modify each of the enabling programmes. A larger plenary was held at the end of the sessions for feedback and further discussion.\n\n- \u00b7  In addition, the Board receives reports on compliance and insurance matters.

A wrap up session at the end of the day ensures the Board and Executive team were able to provide their reflections on the sessions. These reflections are then captured with agreed actions being recorded and followed up, with further Board presentations arranged where required.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By understanding how Croda's activities impact on our various stakeholder groups, the Board can have regard to their interests during discussions and when making decisions.\n\nHaving consideration for our stakeholders aligns with our Purpose and our values, both of which guide us in our approach to delivering our strategic commitments and promoting the long-term success of Croda for our shareholders and society.\n\nThe Board always seeks to understand the priorities and interests of our stakeholder groups during its deliberations and decisionmaking process with the relevance of each stakeholder group changing depending on the issue under discussion. The Chair and Company Secretary provide guidance when required at Board meetings to ensure sufficient consideration is given to the likely consequences of any decisions in the long-term and to the interests and impact of such decisions on our stakeholder groups.

The Board meets regularly with employees, through listening groups and Board presentations. Site visits also present an opportunity for our Directors to connect with and listen to employees across a wide range of functions and locations, with care taken to ensure any engagement sessions contain a diverse selection of employees, be that gender, ethnicity, tenure and role, to ensure that different perspectives can be heard.\n\n## Our customers\n\nOur direct sales model ensures we work closely with customers and allows us to develop a deep understanding of their needs. The Board receives customer insights and information through Board reports from the Group Chief Executive and sector teams, as well as during strategy and business presentations. Strategy sessions will often include customer presentations, providing an 'outside-in' perspective.\n\n## Our communities\n\nAs a responsible business, we believe it is essential that we operate safely and sustainably and that we understand the impact of our operations on local communities and on the environment. Living our Purpose also means we are committed to providing a positive impact on society and we nurture the links we have to our communities through our offices and our sites. The Croda Foundation continues its work in making grants aligned to Croda's Purpose, values and expertise. Engagement with our communities mainly takes place through our local offices and sites, including via\n\nthe STEM and 1% Club programmes. During site visits the Board has the opportunity to hear from employees on activities undertaken with the local communities and on discussions from the community consultation committees. The Board also regularly receives information and feedback on community activities across the Group during management presentations, and considers issues such as local employment and investments in local communities as part of its Board decisions.\n\n## Our suppliers\n\nSupply chain integrity is essential to being a sustainable business and our supplier relationships provide valuable insights to the Board. Site and purchasing teams engage and partner with suppliers on a wide range of matters, from product stewardship and ethical sourcing to regulatory compliance and operational improvements. The Board understands these issues through Board reports and engagement with our operations and functional teams.\n\n## Our shareholders\n\nBoard engagement is primarily through the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and the Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director, who maintain regular dialogue with our shareholders. Committee Chairs have responded to queries from major shareholders regarding their areas of responsibility and this engagement is reported back to the Board. The Directors attend the AGM to allow shareholders to ask questions directly. This year the AGM was also held by webcast, with shareholders online able to ask\n\nquestions before and during the meeting. The Chair, Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee Chair hosted a governance lunch in November which was attended by shareholders representing around 25% of our total issued shares.

The divestment will further our transition into a focused Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. Although the agreement with Cargill was signed in December 2021, the majority of the work to execute the separation of the PTIC assets and business from the rest of Croda took place between January and June 2022, with the transaction closing on 30 June 2022. The Board continued its oversight of this aspect of the transaction, with regular reports and updates from management. The Board considered the impact that the complex separation programme had on our employees, customers and suppliers. All aspects of the separation required careful management of internal and external communications, talent and resources, and an assessment of the interdependencies with other Group programmes to ensure not only that the separation was a success, but whilst also ensuring the continued successful performance of the PTIC business and the retained Croda businesses.\n\nLink to S172(1):\n\nCustomers and consumers\n\nSuppliers\n\nEmployees\n\nShareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nSee page 42\n\n## Change to pension contribution rates\n\nDuring the year the Board undertook its regular review of the UK pension scheme funding, including the output from the UK pension scheme's valuation, which showed that the scheme remained fully funded on a technical provisions basis. Although noting that the scheme's investment remained effective in reducing the valuation volatility and the Company funding risk, the Board took particular note of the fact that the funding of future service accrual had been increasing, partly due to the prolonged lower inflation environment. The Board discussed in detail whether or not to undertake a consultation with employees to increase employee contributions to part fund the total funding cost of future accrual.\n\nThe Board had regard to the results of an employee survey on pensions and discussed the welfare of employees given the rapidly rising cost of living in the UK. The Board considered it was in the best interests of the Company to protect employees from additional pension contributions at a time of rising cost of living and agreed the Company would pay the full cost of the rise in funding. In reaching this decision the Board took account of the fact that the pension was an important benefit for employees and importantly remained a significant retention factor.\n\nLink to S172(1):\n\n## Employees\n\nPension trustees\n\nShareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of a new lipid facility in Lamar, Pennsylvania\n\nIn line with Croda's strategy to 'Empower Biologics Delivery', during 2022 we continued our investment in our Pharma business to ensure capacity would be available for the pipeline of lipid systems used in novel therapeutic drugs. In considering the investment to establish a new lipid facility as part of a new multi-purpose cGMP site in Lamar, Pennsylvania, the Board discussed the future business opportunities and the possible impact of best and worst case scenarios on the existing operational capacity as well as the underlying financial business case. The Board spent considerable time in understanding the proposal to enter into a cooperative agreement with the United States Government (USG) under which the USG would provide up to $75m alongside Croda's own investment of up to $58m to establish the new lipid facility. The Board considered the likely consequences of the investment decision in the long-term and had regard to the interests of Croda's stakeholders who would be affected by the investment.\n\nThe Board considered the interests of Croda's customers, determining that the investment would allow Croda to support their development of vaccines. The Board had regard to alignment of the Company's Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM with the benefits that the new facility at Lamar would have in supporting US preparedness for future health emergencies. The new facility would help ensure enough capacity was available in the US to produce the necessary components for vaccine manufacture.\n\nThe Board concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to approve the investment and enter into the cooperation agreement.\n\nLink to S172(1):\n\nCommunities\n\nCustomers and consumers\n\nShareholders\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board noted that discussions had taken place with raw material suppliers, that new manufacturing technologies would be adopted, and energy efficient systems and equipment would be utilised, all of which would support Croda's sustainability ambition of net zero carbon.\n\n## The Board's focus on sustainability\n\nThe Board remained focused on sustainability and achieving our ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients, becoming Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. In 2022 Croda joined over 200 of the world's leading sustainable companies as the newest member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We also announced our aspiration to become Net Nature Positive by 2030, which will be achieved through an increased focus on preserving and restoring natural ecosystems in our supply chains, minimising the water impact of our operations and helping accelerate sustainable and regenerative agriculture. Each quarter the Board is presented with a sustainability Board report, which includes a balanced scorecard providing an overview of how we are progressing against our ambitious Commitment, identifying areas where more progress is needed. This enables the Board to challenge the executive team on the pace of change and areas requiring more resource.\n\nAs well as quarterly reports, the Board received a strategic presentation from our Chief Sustainability Officer and his team on sustainability leadership. This included a detailed discussion and review of the key strengths and differentiators in Croda's sustainability programme as well as gaps and areas of uncertainty and risk.\n\nThe Board has overseen the production of decarbonisation roadmaps for all of our manufacturing sites, which will not only bring opportunities in terms of reduction in emissions, but also drive innovation, capture cost savings, act as a retention for employees and protect Croda from external risks such as carbon tax and energy costs.\n\nHaving regard to the interests of all stakeholders, the Board concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to approve the investment.\n\nLink to S172(1):\n\nCustomers and consumers Suppliers Employees Shareholders Communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emission remains the industry's biggest challenge and reducing or avoiding scope 3 emissions will be critically important to Croda as our customers transition to net zero.

In addition, with the increasing number and growing complexity of regulations in sustainability reporting, the Board will review how it will continue to ensure that it has comfort that Croda is in compliance with relevant standards and has assurance on the accuracy and reliability of climate-related and other sustainability disclosures. This will include oversight of the control environment in relation to data and information used in support of the disclosures.\n\nThe Board approved the acquisition of Solus Biotech, a Korean based global leader of naturally derived ceramides and phospholipid technologies. The acquisition significantly enhances Croda's sustainable biotechnology capabilities and will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on sustainability\n\nSee pages 48 and 49 and our Sustainability Report",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining regular dialogue with investors and communicating in a clear and transparent manner. A comprehensive investor engagement programme is led by the Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director and comprises results presentations, investor roadshows, attendance at conferences, investor seminars, site visits and ad-hoc meetings.\n\nThis programme includes direct Board engagement through the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chair and other Non-Executive Directors aim to meet major shareholders at least annually to discuss topics including governance, strategy, ESG performance, and remuneration. This gives the Board insight into investors' views, helping to inform key decisions and the future direction of the Company. The Board also reviews monthly submitted papers, meeting presentations and investor feedback following roadshows and events. This extends to commentary on the trading environment and Croda's performance relative to peers.\n\nOur AGM offers the opportunity for all shareholders to hear an update on business performance and engage directly with the Board. Results presentations are webcast live, with engagement and replay facilities, ensuring all investors and analysts can participate and ask questions. Investors can also sign up to receive regulatory alerts on our website ensuring they are notified about Company updates.\n\n## Meeting breakdown\n\nThere was a significant increase in investor engagement in 2022, with interactions with 429 institutions compared with 288 in the prior year. This reflects the impact of the investor seminars and the benefits of a hybrid programme that included both physical and virtual meetings. 28 of our top 30 shareholders met management at least once, and interactions with the top 30, other shareholders and non-holders all increased in absolute terms. Investor engagement levels are notably higher than the average for a FTSE 100 company, being approximately 60% above available benchmarks.\n\nAround 30 investors and analysts joined the site visit to our F&F business in Murcia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Activities during 2022\n\nWe enhanced our engagement with investors in 2022 as lockdown restrictions were lifted, proactively engaging through seminars and site visits to provide a better understanding of our business model and investment case. In March, we held an investor seminar on Consumer Care, to outline market opportunities and sector strategy in addition to explaining how investment in biotechnology will contribute to future growth. The equivalent seminar for Health Care took place at the London Stock Exchange in October, where we relaunched the business as Croda Pharma and outlined the new strategy. Given investor interest in our recent acquisitions, the Managing Director of Avanti attended the Pharma event, and we hosted a shareholder visit to Iberchem in May which was very well attended.\n\nThe 2022 corporate governance lunch was held in November and was attended by shareholders representing over a quarter of our register. Croda was represented by our Chair, Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee Chair. A wide range of topics were discussed including sustainability, Board composition, Executive succession, performance metrics and culture. We intend to extend this representation to include our Audit Committee Chair at the 2023 event.\n\nWe consulted on our proposed Remuneration Policy during 2022, holding video calls with one third of our investor base. The feedback was helpful and we adjusted the policy to respond to specific points made.\n\n## Meeting breakdown by investor location\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meeting breakdown by holders and non-holders\n\n<!-- image -->",

The strength of Croda's business model has helped ensure inflation recovery and profit protection.\n\n## Can you grow Consumer Care when disposable incomes are under pressure?\n\nCroda has the broadest range of critical Consumer Care ingredients in the industry. Our focus on high growth niches, providing sustainable ingredients with performance that is underpinned by innovation, positions us well for growth.\n\n## What drove the exceptional Crop Care performance in 2022?\n\nCrop Protection was the standout business in 2022, delivering strong double digit percentage sales growth, benefitting from a strong agricultural commodity pricing and demand environment, supporting demand for value added crop treatments.\n\n## With COVID-19 vaccine sales peaking, what does the future growth profile look like for Croda Pharma?\n\nPharma is focused on technologies with the fastest growth and innovation needs. We expect Protein and Small Molecule Delivery and Adjuvant Systems to continue growing strongly. Nucleic Acid Delivery sales are expected to be c$120m in 2023, comprising a further reduction in sales for COVID-19 vaccines and strong double digit percentage growth for other applications.\n\n## How are you reallocating capital following the divestment of most of your industrial businesses?\n\nOur priority is organic capital expenditure to pursue a rich seam of growth opportunities in consumer care and life sciences markets. This will be complemented by targeted acquisitions, in line with our 'buy and build' approach to acquire new technology platforms and build scale through organic investment.\n\n## Calendar of investor relations activity in 2022\n\n## March\n\n- \u00b7  Analyst presentation of full year 2021 results\n- \u00b7  Consumer Care investor day\n\n## April\n\n- \u00b7  Scandinavia roadshow\n\n## May\n\n- \u00b7  Shareholder visit to Iberchem head office in Spain\n- \u00b7  Annual General Meeting\n\n## June\n\n- \u00b7  Investor conferences in Paris; visit to Sederma\n- \u00b7  ESG roadshow in Germany and the Netherlands\n- \u00b7  US roadshow\n\n## July\n\n- \u00b7  Analyst presentation of half year 2022 results\n\n## August\n\n- \u00b7  Half year results roadshow\n\n## September\n\n- \u00b7  Investor conferences in London\n- \u00b7  Singapore roadshow\n\n## October\n\n- \u00b7  Croda Pharma investor day\n\n## November\n\n- \u00b7  US pharma roadshow\n- \u00b7  ESG conference in Paris\n- \u00b7  Governance lunch\n\n## December\n\n- \u00b7  Paris roadshow\n- \u00b7  UK conferences\n\n## Shareholder register\n\nCroda's shareholder breakdown by investor type is broadly in line with the FTSE 100 average. 10% of our shares are now held by ESG focused investors which is significantly ahead of our peer group.

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n## The Board and our culture\n\n## How we protect our culture\n\nOur Purpose is to use our Smart science to improve lives\u2122, which guides the choices we make as a business. In line with our Purpose we have committed to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients by ensuring we are Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Our Purpose is reflected in the Board's strategy and is underpinned by our values and our unique culture. The cultural tone of the Company is set by the Board, which is responsible for assessing, monitoring and promoting the Company culture through its decisions and conduct. Croda's positive culture continued to support our employees, suppliers, customers and our local communities.\n\nDuring 2022 the Board discussed the implications for talent management in delivering the Group's strategic plans including employee turnover rates in Croda and our industry. Nurturing Croda's culture is a key element in retention and the Board places high importance on ensuring the organisation and our employees always live our Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM and our values. The Board considers that it is important to continue to share reward and success through the organisation, such as through our Free Share Plan, and that we continue to embrace and enhance flexible working. As well as providing interesting work and career development with transparent career paths and competitive reward packages, we need to ensure employees stay connected with each other and use technology to enhance this.\n\nThe Board spends time focused on the values that underpin the Croda culture. As an example, in 2022 the Board reviewed the leadership value potential matrix developed by management, which provides a tool to develop and encourage different styles of leadership but grounded in Croda's common values of Together, Innovative and Responsible. This enables an assessment of how employees undertake their roles and not just the outcome of tasks and objectives achieved. Our leadership and development programmes all have Croda's Purpose and values running through every element of the course.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we monitor our culture\n\nAlthough not a science, the Board looks at certain metrics to assist it in measuring culture. These include KPIs received on a quarterly basis relating to:\n\n- \u00b7  Diversity and inclusion - such as gender balance, balanced shortlists, diversity on development programmes.\n- \u00b7  Talent development - such as retention rates, training hours and development plans.\n- \u00b7  Wellbeing - including employee engagement scores, pulse survey results, flexible working and accident rates.\n\nAs well as these KPIs, during 2022 the Board also monitored and assessed culture through multiple sources:\n\n- \u00b7  Inviting employees to present at Board and Committee meetings.\n- \u00b7  Regularly meeting with management.\n- \u00b7  Receiving regular reports and data on health and safety and sustainability matters.\n- \u00b7  Receiving regular quarterly reports from all areas of the business including corporate functions.\n- \u00b7  Reviewing reports on significant instances of inappropriate conduct, whether through the Company's Speak-Up line or other grievance channels.\n- \u00b7  Engaging directly with employees around the world through listening groups, site visits and town halls.\n- \u00b7  Discussing the feedback from listening groups and pulse surveys, which enabled communications and policies to be tailored and adjusted to ensure employees' needs were being met.\n- \u00b7  Assessing management's attitude to risk and assurance of the external and internal audit functions through the work and reports of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7  Reviewing the work on diversity and inclusion and succession planning through the reports of the Nomination Committee.\n- \u00b7  Considering feedback from the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Policy is aligned to culture and an assessment of our cultural performance is also embedded in the Remuneration Committee's Discretion Framework. Further detail on how remuneration is addressed across the Company is included in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 102 to 140.\n\n## The voice of our employees\n\nDuring the year the Board, assisted by the Nomination Committee, reviewed mechanisms for employee engagement and concluded that there are a variety of effective mechanisms in place for engaging with our employees. Some examples of these are described below. The Board is comfortable that it can continue to rely on alternative methods to engage with employees, rather than one of the three methods outlined in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.",

        "page_content": "A range of activities for engagement with our employees was agreed at the start of the year, which ensured that the Board had meaningful and regular dialogue with employees. This included holding listening groups, with topics for discussion relevant to the Board matters and employees encouraged to discuss other topics most relevant to them. The Company Secretary takes responsibility for ensuring that those actions requiring feedback are allocated to individuals to follow up on with outcomes reported back to the Board.\n\nThe Board discusses the key themes arising from the listening groups undertaken each year. In 2021 and 2022 these included workload and resource planning, including the importance of making time for employees to think creatively in all aspects of the business. The onboarding of newly acquired companies was also discussed, given the recent acquisitions Croda has made. Mental health was a common topic, with employees appreciating Croda's initiatives to boost mental health and wellbeing and providing platforms to talk about mental health. Diversity and inclusion was discussed with the importance of continuing to maintain an inclusive working environment emphasised. Customer service was discussed in several listening groups as the end of the pandemic had increased demand whilst the Ukraine crisis had put stress on the supply chain. These two issues brought capacity constraints throughout the industry, which impacted customer service. Innovation was also a theme with employees wanting more communication about Croda's open innovation and other large scale innovation programmes. The speed of implementation of digital projects was also a theme that arose and was discussed.\n\n## 'The Board spends time focused on the values that underpin the Croda culture.'\n\nSite visits remain a key element of how our Directors engage with employees. During the year the Board visited our site at Rawcliffe Bridge, engaging with a wide range of employees, with a focus on safety, including the site management team, process engineers, SHE managers and Hazard Study Leaders. The Board was trained on and then undertook scenario based inspection techniques on high hazard processes. This allowed the Directors to have a detailed understanding of the day-to-day work that our employees undertake, as well as being trained on the safety hazards and mitigation across our sites.\n\nMembers of the Board undertook site visits in North America, specifically to Mill Hall, Avanti and Princeton. Feedback from the site visits was discussed during the following Board meeting. The Board also attended a virtual session with the North American regional management team, which included a summary of the business performance and key challenges facing the region. Other site visits made by our Directors during 2022 included our Iberchem head office and manufacturing facility in Mevisa, Spain.\n\nA culture survey was undertaken during the year, split into quarterly 'pulse' surveys. Each question had a theme: purpose, safety, knowledge, and values. The results of the surveys were included in the Board papers with discussion at the Board meeting. This enables the Board to get a feel for the mood of the organisation, shining a light on areas of difference between sites, countries and regions, as well as understanding how important cultural work is being adopted by our businesses.\n\nThe Board strategy day presented further opportunity for the Board to meet with members of the Digital and IT teams, as well as the customer insights teams. Each of the Directors and Executive Committee members has a mentoring relationship with employees below the Executive Committee level. The mentee group is comprised of a diverse group of high potential employees from a range of functions across the business, identified and matched with Executive Committee and Board mentors.\n\nDuring the year Helena Ganczakowski and Steve Foots attended our Leadership Development Group, which provides attendees with a deep understanding of leading and self enhancing capabilities to lead others through times of uncertainty and change, and draws on best practice 'outside in' perspectives to stimulate innovation. Helena was able to provide her insights and experiences in senior leadership roles and a perspective from the Boardroom. These interactions benefit the participants and also the Directors that attend and help the Directors to build relationships with our highest potential employees and leaders in Croda.\n\nAs in previous years, members of the Executive Committee and other senior managers from across the Company attended Board dinners where the Board discussed topics relevant to the business and its strategy.\n\nThe Chair spends time interacting with the Executive Committee team between Board meetings and during the year each member of the Executive management team had regular meetings with the Chair. This ensured that she was kept up to date on significant developments and emerging issues and opportunities, as well as forging good working relationships with the senior management team.\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors have direct access at any time to the Executive Directors, senior management teams and employees across the Group. This provides the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the Company's operations or to request information about specific areas. These interactions not only build connections with employees in the business, they also help provide the knowledge for Non-Executive Directors to provide constructive challenge at Board meetings.",

        "page_content": "## Board leadership Corporate governance continued\n\nThe Company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board, whose role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall leadership of the Group. In this role, it oversees the development and delivery of a clear Group strategy.\n\nAt the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 Directors: the Chair; the Group Chief Executive; the Group Finance Director; the Chief Financial Officer Designate; six independent Non-Executive Directors; and one non-independent Non-Executive Director, who was the Company's Chief Technology Officer until his retirement in 2017. The size of the Board allows time for constructive debate and challenge on key elements of the Company's performance and strategic projects and enables all Directors' views to be heard. It monitors operational and financial performance against agreed goals and objectives and ensures that appropriate controls and systems exist to manage risk and that there are the necessary financial resources and people with the necessary skills to achieve the strategic goals the Board has set. The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of business, financial and international skills and experience, which provide appropriate balance and diversity of thought. The Executive Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when developing strategic plans. The Directors' biographical details are on pages 72 and 73. The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval. These matters include approving the Group's strategy and budget, material corporate transactions and the authorisation of capital expenditure above delegated authority limits. They include matters relating to risk management, approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, dividends, appointing new Directors and significant communications to shareholders. The full schedule of matters reserved for the Board can be found in the Governance section at www.croda.com.\n\nThe Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and others through its Committees, details of which can be found on the opposite page.\n\nExecution of the strategy and day-to-day management of the Company's business is delegated to the Executive Committee, and subsequently to senior leadership teams where relevant, with the Board retaining responsibility for overseeing, guiding and holding management to account. In addition to its monthly scheduled meetings, the Board met and heard from the Executive Committee members, senior management and a wider range of colleagues on a regular basis. Contributions from the Executive Committee members can be found throughout this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe terms of reference for each Board Committee can be found at\n\nCroda.com\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and sets the tone from the top, promoting a culture of openness and debate and effective communication between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. She creates an environment at Board meetings in which all Directors are able to contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy debate and constructive challenge.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThe Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chair and acts as an intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors, where necessary. She is available to shareholders where communication through the Chair or Executive Directors has not been successful or where it may not seem appropriate.\n\n## Independent Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe role of the independent Non-Executive Directors is central to an effective and accountable Board structure as they provide strategic and specialist guidance together with effective governance. They constructively challenge the Executive Directors and scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and ensure all stakeholder views are considered.\n\n## Non-independent Non-Executive Director\n\nHaving served Croda for 33 years, the latter five of which were as a member of the Board, Keith Layden is not considered independent. However, because of that experience, Keith contributes strongly to the Board's culture and personality, and adds unique and valuable insight as well as constructive challenge to Board discussions.\n\n## Group Chief Executive\n\nThe Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of the Group's business and for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular reports to the Board.\n\n## Group Finance Director\n\nThe role of Group Finance Director is to bring a commercial and financial perspective to the Boardroom. Working with the Group Chief Executive, he is responsible for the leadership and management of the Company according to the strategic direction set by the Board. He leads the global finance function and oversees the relationship with the investment community.\n\n## Group General Counsel and Company Secretary\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is Secretary to the Board and its Committees. He works closely with the Chair in the formulation of meeting agendas and annual agenda programmes. He ensures that Board procedures are complied with and also advises on regulatory compliance and corporate governance. This role is to support the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors.",

At present there are eight such Directors, including the Chair and the Senior Independent Director, each of whom has significant commercial experience. Details of their experience is on pages 72 and 73.\n\nThe independence of the Non-Executive Directors is kept under review to ensure continuing independence and objective judgement. The Chair was independent upon her appointment in 2015 and both the Chair as head of the Board and the Chief Executive as head of executive management have clearly defined roles. Further information on their roles is included on page 86. With the exception of Keith Layden, the Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors who served during the year are independent in character and judgement, with no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. Keith Layden is not considered independent, having served as the Company's Chief Technology Officer prior to retirement from the Company and appointment as a Non-Executive Director in May 2017.\n\n## Director induction\n\nThe Company provides new Directors with a comprehensive and tailored induction process. One of the first sessions attended is a health and safety briefing, and the induction schedule includes meetings with members of the Board and Executive Committee, meetings with key senior managers and the Group's audit partner and other key advisers. Induction programmes are developed by the Group's Company Secretarial department and discussions start well in advance of the appointment date to tailor the experience to the existing knowledge and experience.\n\nNew Directors are provided with external training that addresses their role and duties as a Director of a quoted public company. All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the external auditor; the Group's risk register and Schedule of Principal Risks; the latest budget and strategic plan; recent sell-side analyst reports and feedback from our stakeholder engagement programmes; information on our sustainability initiatives; matters reserved for the Board; the Committee terms of reference; and other key policies. This information is supplemented by country and site visits.\n\n## Training\n\nAll Directors keep their knowledge and skills up to date and include training discussions with the Chair in their annual performance reviews. As required, professional advisers are invited to provide in-depth updates and the Board also receives updates on market trends and environmental, technological and social considerations when appropriate. The Company Secretary provides regular updates to the Board and its Committees on regulatory and corporate governance matters. Our Directors receive training on their duties under Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 as part of their induction process from the Group's corporate lawyers. All Directors participate in online compliance training courses as required.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nThe Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each year. In 2020 an externally facilitated Board review was conducted, and we will conduct another externally facilitated review in 2023. This year we used an online questionnaire from Lintstock tailored to Croda's activities and current concerns. Separate questionnaires were also used for the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. A report was prepared based on the",

        "page_content": "completed questionnaires, which facilitated an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees and the support and information received from management and advisers.\n\nThe Board effectiveness report is discussed in detail by the Board, with facilitation by the Chair and the Company Secretary. The report contains a ranking for each question, showing the highest to lowest scoring areas and also the scores against comparator companies that use the Lintstock questionnaires. These provide an additional lens through which the Board can focus the discussion of its effectiveness.\n\nThe composition of the Board and the Board Committees was rated very highly, and the report highlighted the key changes that could be made to the profile of the Board in terms of experience that would match Croda's strategic goals. These will be taken into account in any new Non-Executive Director searches going forward. The Board's understanding of the views and requirements of key stakeholder groups was scored very highly, particularly those of employees. The Board's understanding of the views and requirements of suppliers received a comparatively lower score however and was seen as an area for improvement. The quality of the Board's relationships and its interaction with management received very high ratings, as did the management and focus of meetings. Suggestions for further improvements included limiting the time attendees spent on presentations in order to enable greater discussion time between the presenters and the Board. Board support and information provided to the Board were rated highly overall. Suggestions were made as to areas in which the Board would benefit from further training, including sustainability, which is being picked up as part of the Board's 2023 agenda programme. The top strategic issues facing the Company were identified and now form part of the agenda programme for 2023. Finally, both succession planning and oversight of risk management were positively rated.\n\nThe Chair and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors present to allow an additional opportunity to discuss areas relevant to the operation of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors also met on their own, without the Chair.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director met with the Chair to provide feedback on her performance following discussions with the other Non-Executive Directors and the Executive management to gather their views. It was agreed that the Chair remained dedicated to her role. She creates a culture of trust, openness and debate, facilitating an atmosphere of challenge whilst encouraging the effective contribution of all Board members.\n\nThe Chair met and provided feedback to each Non-Executive Director and the Executive Directors. Following these discussions, the Chair was satisfied that all the Directors continued to be effective and demonstrate commitment to the role, including having time to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out all their duties.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nA well established process is in place whereby the Board regularly reviews and monitors potential conflicts of interests. Under the Company's Articles of Association, the non-conflicted Board members have authority to authorise a conflict or potential conflict of interest. Directors holding significant commitments outside of the Company are required to disclose them prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there are any changes. Actual and potential conflicts of interest are included on a register which is maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed annually.\n\nDuring the appointment of any new Non-Executive Directors, the candidate's other commitments are taken into account, in addition to whether or not a conflict or potential conflict would exist. Details of the professional commitments of the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors are included in their biographies on pages 72 and 73. The Board is satisfied that these do not interfere or conflict with the performance of their duties for the Company.\n\n## Board support\n\nEach Director has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Where necessary, the Directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. Papers are made available electronically one week in advance of meetings, which ensures that each Director has the time and resources to fulfil their duties. A resource centre within the web portal provides access to useful information about the Group, including corporate governance materials, finance and strategy information, Group policies and procedures, and information on topics such as risk and insurance. In order to build and increase the Non-Executive Directors' familiarity with, and understanding of, the Group's people, businesses and markets, senior managers regularly make presentations at Board meetings. Their understanding of the Group's operations is enhanced by regular business presentations and site visits whenever possible. At induction, and as requirements change, training is provided on governance, legal and regulatory matters. Online training is provided on competition law and anti-bribery and corruption. Specific training is provided when requested by the Directors. To remain up to date with wider issues the Directors are encouraged to participate in events hosted by external organisations to develop broader perspectives.\n\n## Board re-election\n\nFollowing the individual performance assessments, the Board is satisfied that each Director continues to perform effectively, allocates sufficient time for their duties and remains fully committed to their role. Full biographies for the Directors are on pages 72 and 73. The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors can be viewed at www.croda.com. Contracts for Executive and Non-Executive Directors can be inspected during normal business hours at the Company's registered office by contacting the Company Secretary and will also be available for inspection at the AGM. The Directors, with the exception of Jez Maiden and Helena Ganczakowski, will be proposed for election and re-election at the AGM on 26 April 2023 and details are in the Notice of Meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control Corporate governance continued\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nTo assist the Board in determining whether the Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable, the annual report team prepared a Board paper that, amongst other things, reviewed the process of preparation of the report, the controls in place to ensure consistency and reliability of the underlying information, identified the material positive and negative matters referred to in the report to ensure balanced content and provided details of the level of senior oversight of the content of the report.\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the Board enough time to assess whether it is fair, balanced and understandable, as required by the Code. The key themes and messages to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts are considered by the Board early in the process.\n\nThe Board considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts contained the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Directors received a full draft of the Annual Report and provided feedback. This review ensures that each Director has an opportunity to highlight any areas requiring further clarity as well as suggesting issues and areas that were not adequately covered or on which the report may have placed too much emphasis.\n\nThe key messages in the narrative in the Strategic Report and Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were reviewed to ensure they were consistent with the financial reporting contained in the financial statements. The Board believed that clear explanations had been provided for the KPIs.\n\nThe Board reviewed whether the Annual Report and Accounts disclosed the successes and the challenges that had been faced in the period and that the narrative and analysis effectively balanced the information needs and interests of each of our key stakeholder groups. In particular, the Board had regard to the current macro economic and uncertain geopolitical environment and the inflationary pressures worldwide caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nThe framework and layout were considered to be clear and coherent, with a consistent tone throughout and clearly signposted linkage between all sections, in a manner that reflected a comprehensive narrative and highlighted the key messages appropriately throughout.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full statement of Directors' responsibilities See page 144\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal controls and risk management, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial Business Reporting 2014, and in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## 'The Board receives updates on principal risks and risk appetite on an annual basis.'\n\nExecutive management have established an organisational structure with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority which was reviewed by the Board (page 87). In particular, there are clear procedures and defined authorities for the following:\n\n## Financial reporting and financial statements review\n\nPolicies and procedures governing the financial reporting process and preparation of the financial statements are owned by the Group Finance Director and clearly and transparently communicated through the Group Policies system. In order to assess the financial statements, the Audit Committee regularly reviews reports from members of the finance team and the external auditor who is invited to attend the Committee's meetings. When conducting its review the Committee considers material accounting assumptions and estimates made by management, any significant judgements or key audit matters identified by the auditor (pages 149 to 152), compliance with relevant accounting standards and other regulatory reporting requirements, including the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, and the accounting policies and procedures applied (pages 97 and 98).\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is a key element of the Group's corporate governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and internal controls to the Board and Audit Committee and the Group. It supports the Group's strategy and objectives by evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business policies and procedures, system and key internal controls. In reporting on their reviews, internal audit makes recommendations to address issues and improve processes. Once recommendations are agreed with management, the internal audit function monitors their implementation and reports to the Audit Committee on progress at every meeting. See pages 98 and 99 of the Audit Committee report.",

        "page_content": "## Capital investment\n\nThe Finance Committee (a sub-committee of the Executive Committee) operates a clearly defined capital expenditure process including detailed business plan appraisal, risk analysis and authorisation. The Global Capital Project Director has developed a framework for managing major capital expenditure, and postinvestment review processes are completed by internal audit (at the Audit Committee's request).\n\n## Business risk management\n\nAs described on page 52 the Executive Committee has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing emerging and principal risks. The Board receives updates on principal risks and risk appetite on an annual basis and the Audit Committee receives reports from internal audit on the effectiveness of mitigating controls in place over selected principal risks at each meeting. The Risk Management steering group, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee (page 87), meets on a quarterly basis to monitor and review both current and emerging risks.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThere is a documented framework of required internal controls for business processes, IT, safety and quality, which form part of our business as usual activities and which are documented in controls manuals. Policies governing the internal controls are documented in the Group Policies system, which is available online to all employees, and each Group policy is owned by a member of the Executive Committee. Confirmation that the controls are being adhered to is the responsibility of managers, who together with their teams complete an annual self-assessment process against all controls which provides a snapshot of the control environment at the start of the year. Compliance with controls is tested by the internal audit team as part of their annual plan of work approved by the Audit Committee each year (page 98), as well as being tested by other internal assurance providers.\n\nThe Board discharged its responsibility for monitoring the operational effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems throughout the year using a process which involved:\n\n- \u00b7  Delegation of review of systems of risk management and internal control to the Audit Committee, whose activities are described in detail on pages 96 to 101.\n- \u00b7  Receipt of written confirmations from senior management.\n- \u00b7  Board review of the report on significant control weaknesses.\n- \u00b7  Annual review of risk appetite statements and principal risks (page 52).\n\nThese processes have been in place for the full financial year up to the date on which the financial statements were approved by the Board. The systems are designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.",

The FRC's Guidance on Board Effectiveness comments that boards are more likely to make good decisions and maximise opportunities for long-term success if their members collectively have the right balance of skills, experience, knowledge and independence. The review in 2022 guided the Committee's assessment of the skills and experience for both searches, details of which are summarised on page 95.\n\nOn 1 January 2023 Louisa Burdett joined Croda and the Board. Louisa will succeed Jez as Group Finance Director on 13 March 2023, and Jez will step down from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2023 and retire from the Company on 31 May 2023. Jez has been instrumental in the development and growth of Croda, always nurturing a culture of transformation. I have hugely appreciated his diligence, intellect and thoughtful approach, particularly his contribution to Board debate. On behalf of the Board and all my Croda colleagues, I would like to thank Jez for his outstanding contribution over the last eight years, and wish him the very best for the future.\n\nI am delighted that we have been able to appoint Louisa as Jez's successor. She has an exceptional ten-year track record as a CFO of listed companies, with valuable experience both in speciality chemicals and the broader manufacturing sector. This includes four years as CFO of Meggitt, before it was acquired by Parker-Hannifin in September 2022, and five years as CFO of Victrex, the speciality chemicals company.\n\nLouisa's appointment brings even greater diversity to the Board in terms of gender and ensures we continue to meet our commitment for gender balance on the Board. We also have gone beyond the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic diversity.\n\nIn preparation for Helena's retirement, Jacqui Ferguson took over as Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 1 September 2022. This gave Jacqui a good period as Chair to prepare for the Committee's review of the Company's Remuneration Policy at the end of the year. Jacqui has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since 1 September 2018.",

It evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7  To regularly review the structure, size and composition, including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity, of the Board and make recommendations for any changes to the Board.\n- \u00b7  To give full consideration to succession planning for Directors and other senior Executives, taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company and, consequently, what skills and expertise the Board will need in the future.\n- \u00b7  Where a Board vacancy is identified, to evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board, and prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for the respective appointment.\n- \u00b7  To identify and nominate candidates to fill Board vacancies, for the approval of the Board, as and when openings arise.\n- \u00b7  To keep the organisation's leadership needs, both Executive and Non-Executive, under review to ensure that the Company continues to compete effectively in the marketplace.\n- \u00b7  To review annually the time required from a Non-Executive Director and the Chair to fulfil their duties.\n- \u00b7  To make recommendations on succession planning for the Board.\n\nHelena will remain a member of the Remuneration Committee and will continue in her role as the Senior Independent Director until her retirement from the Board, at which time Jacqui Ferguson will succeed Helena as Senior Independent Director.\n\nJohn Ramsay's and my own appointment were considered by the Committee. John's term was extended by three years, having completed his first three-year term. My term of office was extended by another year in line with the Nomination Committee policy that once a Non-Executive Director has served six years, any extension to their term would be on a year by year basis.\n\nOur Group HR Director, Tracy Sheedy, will also retire from the Executive Committee and the Company at the end of April after six years in the role. Tracy's successor, Michelle Lydon, was appointed on 1 January 2023 and joined the Executive Committee. She will take over from Tracy as President Human Resources in mid-March. Michelle is an experienced HR leader, having recently been Chief People Officer for British Airways and before that QinetiQ.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee also reviewed the emergency succession planning for both the Group Chief Executive and Chair roles.

In the event I was unavailable to perform my role as Chair, the expectation would be that the Senior Independent Director would take on the Chair responsibilities.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nHaving a diverse and talented group of people at all levels of Croda is essential for delivering success. The Board supports the recommendations of the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review in relation to gender and ethnic diversity. I am pleased to report that we have now achieved a position of gender balance on the Board as well as female Directors as Chair, Senior Independent Director and, with the appointment of Louisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe gender balance on the Executive Committee and senior management teams (direct reports to the Executive Committee) by 31 December 2022 stood at 38% female. We continued to increase the diversity of our leaders below Board and Executive Committee level. 29% of our top 55 employees are female, with the top 55 made up of employees across 11 nationalities.",

The Committee and the Board receives updates from the Group HR Director on these activities throughout the year. Members of the senior management team and potential future leaders are given the opportunity to present to the Board whenever the opportunity arises. Also, Board members are invited to attend feedback sessions with the Group D&I Committee and regional D&I committee members on an annual basis. Topics have included LGBTQ, Black and ethnic minority inclusion at Croda, where passionate speakers talk about their lived experience in order to create awareness and shape onward discussions.\n\nA copy of our Board Diversity Policy, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, is available in the corporate governance section at www.croda.com. The Board has committed to meeting or exceeding the target set by the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review. For more information on our Board see the Directors' biographies on pages 72 and 73.\n\n## Other activities of the Committee\n\nThe Committee reviewed the time commitment of the Non-Executive Directors. This is assessed before appointment and on an annual basis. The Committee was satisfied that all the Non-Executive Directors remain able to commit the required time for the proper performance of their duties.\n\nThe Committee considered and concluded that, except for Keith Layden, all the Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria of independence. As Keith was formerly an Executive Director of the Company, he is not currently considered to be independent.\n\nThe annual Committee evaluation was conducted using an online questionnaire from Lintstock tailored to Croda's activities and current concerns to consider the Committee's operations, oversight and progress during the year. The evaluation confirmed that the Committee continued to be well led and excellent progress had been made with the Board appointments during the year.\n\nI will have served my nine years on the Board and as Chair in April 2024 and the Committee has started to consider the process to find my successor. As Senior Independent Director, Helena Ganczakowski chairs the Committee for all discussions concerning the search for my successor, and is working closely with our Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary to identify suitable search firms to work on the search. A specification will be drawn up with contributions from each member of the Committee and the search will commence during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDame Anita Frew DBE, Chair of the Nomination Committee\n\n## Defining the criteria for our new Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n\nThe Nomination Committee spent considerable time scoping the requirements for the new CFO to replace Jez Maiden.\n\nHaving selected Egon Zehnder (EZ) as the firm to lead the search, members of the Committee worked with EZ to develop and then fine tune the specification/brief to ensure EZ had a clear understanding of the cultural aspects of the search, the key challenges and priorities for the CFO and the personal skills and qualities needed. EZ has no connection with the Company or any individual Director.\n\nKey challenges and priorities - The CFO is a trusted and strategic partner to the Group Chief Executive, a key member of the Executive team and the Board, and leads our engagement with the investor community alongside the Group Chief Executive. It was essential to find someone who could continue with and build upon the work Jez Maiden had undertaken in building a world class, future proof finance function backed by top diverse talent, digital technology and strong processes.\n\nPersonal characteristics - The Croda culture is a significant competitive advantage, so as well as finding candidates with the key critical skills and experience, the CFO needed to identify with and live our corporate values and Purpose, individually, and as part of the leadership team. The Committee looked for candidates with humility, authenticity, an inclusive leadership style and a natural team player, and that thrive in a nimble, entrepreneurial and fast-moving business, who would bring a continuous improvement mind-set that is appropriate for Croda's stage of development and aspirations as well having positive energy and a 'can do' attitude.\n\nSkills and experience - The critical skills and experience that the Committee specified for the search included, amongst other things, being a well-rounded finance leader of a complex, global business with a dispersed customer and operational/ manufacturing footprint, and experience in innovation led, growth oriented (organic and inorganic) settings. The ability to inspire, motivate and empower high performing diverse teams was critical, as was establishing a collaborative culture within Croda to help shape corporate strategy for further growth.\n\nDiversity - Broad diversity was a key consideration for the search. To meet the Commitment target set for gender balance in senior decision making roles, our search firm was required to bring forward a balanced longlist of candidates.",

This report provides shareholders with an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas considered when discharging its responsibilities and providing assurance on the integrity of the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nAs the restrictions surrounding the pandemic eased, the Committee has thankfully been able to meet in person during the year rather than by video conference as was the case through much of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly the external audit and internal audit teams were largely able to revert to physical presence at audits. I received regular updates from the Group Finance Director, the wider global finance team, the Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive management team, the audit teams and Croda employees has once again delivered high quality and robust audit processes.\n\nThe Board including myself spent a considerable time in the search for our new Chief Financial Officer, Louisa Burdett who joined the Board on 1 January 2023. A critical role of the Audit Committee Chair is to develop a strong, professional, healthy relationship with the Chief Financial Officer, developing mutual trust in the relationship to ensure constructive challenge in support of highly effective internal controls and injecting objectivity into the Company's financial disclosures. I have built an excellent working relationship with Jez Maiden, and on behalf of the Committee I wish to thank him for his professional and highly valued contribution to Croda and to the work of the Committee. I am looking forward to building the same relationship with Louisa.\n\nHaving served 14 years as VP Risk and Assurance and over 16 years as an employee of Croda, Hazel Whitaker retired from her role in August 2022. On behalf of the Committee and the Board, I wish to thank Hazel for her commitment and contribution to Croda and her support to the Committee. Eduardo Peloia assumed the role of VP Risk and Assurance. Eduardo has worked at Croda for 7 years and was formerly the Finance Director for our Latam region.\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe Committee at the end of the year comprised of six independent Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is outlined on pages 72 and 73. The Board considers all members of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic direction of the Group.\n\nThese skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be fully effective. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.",

The meetings were held in advance of the Board where I provided a report of the key matters that were discussed and any emerging areas that may require additional focus. A programme of business is agreed at the start of the year and it is reviewed and updated to ensure any emerging areas identified are considered.\n\nTo ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the internal and external auditors. Meetings without the Executive Directors present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate open dialogue and assurance. Before each Audit Committee meeting, I also meet with the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the VP Risk and Assurance to discuss control and compliance issues generally and specifically the detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure sufficient time is devoted to them at the meetings.\n\n## Time allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Specific focus areas in 2022\n\n- \u00b7  Maintain focus on cyber security and the delivery of projects identified in the 2021 information security strategy.\n- \u00b7  Monitor progress in the development of processes and controls over the reporting of non-financial KPIs, particularly relating to sustainability.\n- \u00b7  Monitor the impact of major business change programmes on Croda's risk and control environment.\n- \u00b7  Review management's oversight and monitoring of quality controls within the health care sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 99 for progress on these areas.\n\n## Committee activity in 2022\n\nThe Committee's core activities, as well as the additional focus areas, and an estimate of the proportion of time spent on them, are:\n\n## Financial reporting (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Monitored the Group's financial statements and results announcements, including the Annual Report and the interim statement, and with support from the external auditors, reviewed those items in the Group's financial statements that were material to our reporting. The Committee challenged management on the statements and was satisfied with the explanations provided. Consideration was given to the appropriateness of accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation of uncertainty. Recommendations were made to the Board supporting the half and full-year accounts and financial statements.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Group's external reporting framework and use of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to assess ongoing appropriateness. The Committee was satisfied that the APMs reviewed were consistent with market practice of both the peer group and wider FTSE 100 companies, and that disclosure and reconciliation to statutory measures were appropriate.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed consideration given by management relating to various FRC thematic reviews and guidance for financial reporting.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the impairment testing reviews on goodwill balances on the Group's balance sheet and was satisfied with the output of the reviews which included an impairment of the Flavours cash generating unit covered under significant financial statement reporting items. In conjunction with the Board, reviewed the financial modelling and stress testing conducted for the going concern assessment. A recommendation was made to the Board to support the going concern statement. Further information can be found on page 164.",

The Committee challenged the assumptions and calculations in the modelling and scenarios, noting the effect they would have during the viability period and were satisfied that they were robust and well thought through. Further information can be found on page 59.\n- \u00b7  Undertook regular reviews of the Group's litigation. The Committee receives reports twice a year from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and was satisfied with the approach to provisioning and disclosure.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the accounting treatment of the divestment of the majority of the PTIC business.\n\n## Governance (10%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's anti-bribery and fraud procedures, including those for whistleblowing. The Committee received a report on the independent investigations that had been conducted in response to concerns raised under the whistleblowing and fraud policies and were satisfied with the outcome, including follow-up actions. The Committee also reviewed a summary of the controls in place to mitigate the risk of fraud in the Group. The Committee was satisfied that the ethics and fraud programmes were effective. Further work on fraud risk assessment will take place during 2023 in preparation for the Directors' fraud statement, which is a planned disclosure under the UK Government's proposed corporate reforms.\n- \u00b7  Undertook an external evaluation of the Committee's effectiveness. Information on the evaluation process can be found on page 100. The results of the review concluded that the Committee continued to be effective.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Committee's terms of reference and confirmed that the role and responsibilities of the Committee are aligned with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. No changes were made during the year.\n- \u00b7  Undertook its annual legal and compliance review of the corporate governance and regulatory requirements of the Committee, concluding that it was in full compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and other corporate governance requirements.\n- \u00b7  Completed its annual review of the Group's tax compliance policy and risks relating thereto. No significant updates were required. The policy is available at www.croda.com.\n\nThe Committee spent considerable time during the year focusing on and assessing the expected impact of the UK Government's proposed corporate reforms on Croda, including the future requirement to provide a statement on the effectiveness of internal control systems and the proposals to publish a resilience statement in the Annual Report. The Committee agreed an indicative timeline outlining the planned actions for meeting such requirements, building this within the agenda programme for the year. While the Government has not yet formalised the proposed reforms the Committee is keen that the Company is aligned with emerging best practice so this will be a focus area for the Committee in 2023.\n\n## External audit (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Discussed and approved the external audit plan, including the assessment of significant audit risks; the engagement risk profile; the use of data analytics; the scope of the audit in terms of coverage, the materiality level and the de minimis reporting threshold; the co-ordination of external audits; and the key members of the engagement team. The Committee monitored the progress made by the statutory audit team against the agreed plan and discussed issues as they arose.\n- \u00b7  Discussed and approved the increase to the external audit fee. The Committee was concerned about the level of fee increase proposed and challenged the auditor before agreeing to a 45% increase over two years, whilst ensuring that the external audit was delivered effectively. The reasons given by the auditor for the increase were inflation in professional staff salaries, increased regulation and expansion in the scope of the audit. Information on the audit fees can be found in note 3 on page 174.\n- \u00b7  Directed the auditor to ensure sufficient focus on areas of particular concern to the Committee (eg the impact of the PTIC divestment and separation).\n- \u00b7  Reviewed in-depth a range of indicators to judge the overall audit quality as described in the auditor effectiveness considerations on page 100.\n- \u00b7  Met with the auditor without management present.

The Committee confirmed the independence of the auditor as further described on page 101.\n- \u00b7  Considered the effectiveness of the external audit process, concluding that the audit was effective (see page 100) and a recommendation was made to the Board on the re-appointment of KPMG as auditor at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Internal audit and risk management (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the internal audit planning approach and its link to the Company strategy, reviewed reports on the work of the internal audit function from the VP Risk and Assurance and monitored compliance with the Group risk assurance programme. The Committee approved the internal audit plan and the implementation of any resulting actions by management.\n- \u00b7  Discussed the results of the 2022 controls assurance internal audits delivered by our co-source partner, PwC. The Committee considered the adequacy of management's response to matters raised and the timeliness in resolving such matters.\n- \u00b7  Discussed sustainability related non-financial KPIs and how the Audit Committee and the Board could obtain visibility about the processes and systems that underlie the KPI calculations.

We will:\n\n- \u00b7  Maintain focus on cyber security and the delivery of projects identified in the information security strategy\n- \u00b7  Maintain focus on monitoring the impact of major business change programmes on Croda's risk and control environment\n- \u00b7  Monitor progress of control framework changes resulting from UK corporate reform\n- \u00b7  Review management's oversight and monitoring of quality controls within the Pharma business\n\n## Internal audit and risk management\n\nI met with the VP Risk and Assurance several times during the year outside of the formal meetings to discuss the performance and output of the internal audit function and aspects of risk management. The VP Risk and Assurance attended each Committee meeting and presented an internal audit report that was fully reviewed and discussed, highlighting any major deviations from the annual plan agreed with the Committee. I also participated in the selection of a new VP Risk and Assurance from within the business.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee considered the results of the audits undertaken and the adequacy of management's response to matters raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. Particular focus was addressed to those areas where there was a major divergence between the outcome of the internal audit and the scoring of the self-assessment questionnaire, completed annually by each business unit. In these instances, the Committee challenged management as to what actions it was taking to minimise divergences arising in the future.\n\nIn January, the Committee conducted its annual review of the internal audit function, including its approach to audit planning and risk assessment, communication within the business and with the Committee and its relationship with the external auditors. Senior management feedback from sites, included in the 2022 audit programme, is gathered by questionnaire to support this process. Details on how the business monitors risk and how it implements its risk management framework are set out on pages 52 to 54.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe Committee performance was assessed as part of the internal annual Board evaluation process (see pages 88 and 89). The output of the evaluation was considered by the Committee in January 2023.\n\nOverall, the evaluation concluded that the Committee was operating effectively. The overall performance of the Audit Committee and that of the Committee Chair were both highly rated. The Committee's use of time was highly commended, with meetings being well run with appropriate time allowed for more in-depth discussion when required. Agenda coverage through the year was seen as full and appropriate. Committee members were well prepared for meetings, engendering informed discussions and constructive debate.\n\nThe Committee's effectiveness at assessing the system of internal controls was rated positively, including its regular review of general computer controls. Relationships between the Committee and Croda\n\nmanagement were considered very effective with the Audit Committee providing both support and challenge. The relationship with KPMG's lead audit partner also received good ratings.\n\nThe review highlighted the need for further focus on cyber and the execution of the cyber programme as well as to continue its focus on the UK corporate reforms and non-financial reporting. Four focus areas for 2023 were identified and these are summarised above.\n\n## External auditor's effectiveness\n\nDuring the year, the Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG as Group external auditor. To assist in the assessment, the Committee considered the quality of reports from KPMG and the additional insights provided by the audit team, particularly at partner level. It took account of the views of the Group Finance Director and Group Financial Controller, who had discussed subsidiary component audits with local audit partners, to gauge the quality of the team and knowledge and understanding of the business. The Committee also considered how well the auditor assessed key accounting and audit judgements and the way it applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the output from a questionnaire completed by senior members of the finance team to obtain their views on KPMG's effectiveness in carrying out the audit. The questionnaire covered:\n\n- \u00b7  Structure of the external audit team and their quality and approach.\n- \u00b7  The planning, delivery and execution of the audit.\n- \u00b7  The effectiveness of their reporting.\n- \u00b7  Effectiveness of communications between management and the audit team.\n- \u00b7  Robustness of the audit, including the independence of the external audit team and their ability to challenge management as well as demonstrate professional scepticism and independence.\n- \u00b7  The external audit team's judgement.\n\nScores were compared with previous years to understand trends and highlight areas of improvement. The independence, team size, seniority and expertise of the external audit team continued to be assessed positively. Examples included that the senior team had dealt with complex issues as they came up and were helpful in providing feedback on technical accounting and disclosure issues. Regional close-out meetings had been succinct and clear. Minor improvement areas were noted, which included the need for clearer upfront planning and effective communication on progress in some areas.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed a report produced by KPMG that summarised the internal measures that KPMG used to assess audit quality as well as responses to thematic areas identified by the FRC that were relevant to the Croda audit.\n\nThere were several quality interventions that attributed to the overall audit quality and ensured independent challenge. These included the use of specialists, audit consultations, a technical review, a second line inflight review and finally an independent audit partner review.",

        "page_content": "## External auditor's independence\n\nThe Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the objectivity of the Group's external auditor, KPMG, in reporting to shareholders. Our Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by external auditors, which is on our website www.croda.com, sets out permitted and prohibited non-audit services and the controls over assignments awarded to the external auditor to ensure that audit independence is not compromised and the provision of such services does not impair the external auditor's objectivity.\n\nDuring 2023, it was identified that certain KPMG member firms had provided preparation of local GAAP financial statement services and in some cases, foreign language translation of those financial statements, over the period 2019 to 2022. No entities with these services were in scope for the group audit. No entities with word processing services were in scope for the group audit. The services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work was undertaken after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG for each of the impacted financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. In the Committee's view, based on their assessment of the breach, KPMG's integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of these services would not impair KPMG's integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years.\n\nIn 2022, non-audit fees were \u00a30.2m, significantly less than the total audit fees of \u00a32.4m; the non-audit to audit fees ratio stands at 0.1:1.\n\n## Significant financial statement reporting items\n\nThe Committee, with support from the external auditor, reviewed those items in the Group's and Parent Company's financial statements that have the potential to significantly impact reporting. These are set out below.\n\nImpact of the divestment of the majority of PTIC: On 30 June 2022, the Group divested the majority of its PTIC businesses to Cargill for gross proceeds of \u20ac775m (\u00a3665m), subject to customary adjustments for separation costs and cash/debt-like items. This divestment excluded the potential sale of Croda Sipo in China in which we have a 65% shareholding. The Group has recognised a profit before tax on the disposal of \u00a3356.0m, with the Parent Company recognising a profit before tax on disposal of \u00a36.5m. The Committee assessed the key accounting considerations, and after challenge, was satisfied that the disposal group did not meet the requirements to be classified as a discontinued operation.\n\nGoodwill impairment: The strategy of the Group includes acquiring new technologies and businesses operating in adjacent markets. As a result, goodwill represents a significant asset value on the balance sheet of \u00a3844.6m out of total net assets of \u00a32,431.1m at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Committee completed its annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill, as prepared by management, including the detailed sensitivity analysis to a number of underlying assumptions, including the current macroeconomic outlook and the broader consequences on the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Committee undertook its annual review of the Group's policies relating to external audit, including the policy that governs how and when employees and former employees of the Group's auditor can be employed by the Company. No changes were made. The Committee also reviewed and accepted KPMG's independence letter which annually confirms their independence and compliance with the FRC's ethical standard. In conclusion, the Committee agreed that KPMG were independent.\n\nCroda is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. We undertook an audit tender in 2017 and the Board appointed KPMG as external auditor, with Chris Heald as the Lead Audit Partner. The first year to be audited by KPMG was the year ended 31 December 2018. Subject to the continued quality and effectiveness of the current auditor, we plan to re-tender ahead of a 2028 appointment. Following an organisational change in KPMG, Chris Heald stepped down as Lead Audit Partner following the 2021 AGM and was succeeded by Ian Griffiths.\n\n## External auditor reappointment\n\nAs noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that KPMG be offered for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. I will be available at the shareholder engagement event to respond to any questions shareholders may raise on the Committee's activities in the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Ramsay, Chair of the Audit Committee\n\nThe Committee assessed the methodologies used and the adequacy of the management disclosures. Particular attention was given to the Flavours cash generating unit's value in use model, which demonstrated a \u00a334.6m impairment versus its carrying value as lower forecast sales and margin have reduced its future value projection. The Committee reviewed the methodology adopted to evaluate the risk of goodwill impairment. After challenge, the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions were reasonable and that no other impairments were necessary; however, enhanced disclosure was agreed to be appropriate for the Fragrances cash generating unit, given the sensitivity of the calculations to certain assumptions.\n\nPensions: The Committee monitored the Group's pension arrangements, in particular the funding of the defined benefit plan in the UK, which are sensitive to assumptions made in respect of discount rates, salary increases and inflation.\n\nThe Group engages external actuarial specialists. The Committee reviewed the actuarial assumptions used and compared them with those used by other companies. The external auditors also challenged the benchmark assumptions applied and conducted sensitivity analysis. Following their review, the Committee found the assumptions to be reasonable.\n\nParent Company's carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables: The Committee reviewed the risks around the carrying amount of the parent Company's investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors, which had previously been disclosed as a significant reporting item. However, the relative significance of this matter has reduced in the current period due to the disposal of PTIC businesses and therefore it was concluded that separate consideration was no longer required.",

Chair's letter\n\nOn behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present Croda's Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. This is my first report as Chair, having been a member of the Remuneration Committee for four years. I would like to thank Dr Helena Ganczakowski for her work and significant contribution as Committee Chair prior to my appointment.\n\nThe Committee believes that Croda's remuneration approach plays a key role in the continued achievement of the Group's strategic objectives and in the delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. We last reviewed and updated our policy to ensure ongoing alignment to Croda's evolving ambition in 2020 and received 97.6% votes in favour. Last year we were pleased to receive 95.0% votes in favour of the 2021 Remuneration Report.\n\nThis year's Policy review has given us the opportunity to engage with shareholders and to refresh our policy and its application to enable Croda's strategy and ambition. We are grateful to shareholders who gave their time as part of the consultation, and we adapted our proposals as a result of feedback received.\n\nThroughout the review we have also been mindful of new governance expectations, shareholder sentiment, and the changing dynamics of our workforce including the cost-of-living crisis and the impact this has on our workforce. The Committee is keen to ensure our remuneration approach reflects the developing needs of all our stakeholders.\n\n## Remuneration Policy review\n\nSince the approval of the current Directors' Remuneration Policy in 2020, Croda has grown and is now a constituent of the FTSE 50 (with c.\u00a32.6bn of shareholder value created over the last three years).\n\nIn line with our strategy to transition to a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences business, Croda has recently concluded the divestment of the majority of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) businesses. Croda will continue to focus on consistently delivering sustainable, profitable growth by providing innovative, sustainable solutions to our customers, consistent with our Purpose: Smart science to improve lives TM . Future growth will be driven principally through organic investment and through acquisition.\n\nOur focus on Consumer Care and Life Sciences means that our leaders will be managing an increasingly complex and international business and these changes will impact the nature of talent required across our organisation.\n\nTherefore, the focus of the Remuneration Policy review was to ensure that the existing remuneration framework and its implementation remained aligned to the business strategy and the evolving scope and responsibilities of our leadership roles.\n\nOur updated Policy largely reflects our need to address the implications of the significant growth of the Company, the growing complexity of the business and the level of sector competitiveness to ensure we can continue to attract and retain the best talent.",

        "page_content": "In summary, we are proposing quantum increases to both the Group Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme (senior annual Bonus Plan) and Performance Share Plan (PSP), although opportunity levels remain modest in comparison to our peers, along with the introduction of an ESG metric into the senior annual Bonus Plan reflective of shareholder feedback and our strategic priorities. We also propose to increase shareholding guidelines and, in response to shareholder feedback, to increase our post-employment shareholding requirement.\n\nIn developing our Remuneration Policy, we undertook a significant consultation exercise and we are grateful that most of our top 20 shareholders gave their time to discuss and provide advice on our proposals. Others provided a written response. We also consulted with proxy agencies and took account of their views. In total we invited c.60% of our shareholder base to take part in the consultation exercise and directly engaged through video calls with approximately 31% of our shareholder base. We adjusted our proposals as a result of feedback during the consultation process as outlined further below.\n\n## Summary of proposals\n\n## Increase to the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP maximum\n\nincentives - Against the background of strong business performance, increased complexity and evolving talent needs, we are proposing an increase to incentives for both Executive Directors.\n\nWhile our approach to remuneration has never been driven by benchmarking, our view is that this proposed increase in incentive opportunity is aligned to shareholder interests to support the next phase of the Group's strategic development. The benchmarking suggested that it was the senior annual Bonus Plan opportunity in particular which has fallen significantly below market for a company of our size and there was a case for an increase. However, we were keen to continue with an incentive structure heavily weighted to the long-term.\n\nThe proposal is an increase to the maximum annual bonus of 25% of base salary and an increase to the maximum PSP of 25% of base salary. The resulting incentive levels (set out on page 108) will continue to be modest against the market.\n\nShareholding guidelines - We are increasing the shareholding guidelines so that they are in line with the increased PSP opportunity, meaning a shareholding guideline of 250% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nPost-employment shareholding - The time horizon for postemployment shareholding will be extended to apply in full over the two years, rather than operating on a tapered basis during this period.\n\nRecruitment headroom - We are proposing additional annual bonus headroom (maximum 200% of salary) in the Policy which would only be permitted to be used in exceptional circumstances of recruitment.\n\nThe above are the key structural changes to our Remuneration Policy. Our review also included consideration of our overall performance framework and as a result of this review we are also proposing some changes to the implementation of our Policy.\n\n## Performance measures for the senior annual Bonus Plan\n\nCurrently our senior annual Bonus Plan is based 100% on profit performance with no bonus payable until the previous year's profit is exceeded. Prior to the review we had received feedback from some shareholders that they would like to see additional measures introduced.\n\nFollowing our review we concluded that, given the increased complexity of the business, as well as the proposed increase in annual bonus levels, it would be appropriate to introduce another measure in order to better reflect overall performance for all our stakeholders.\n\nWe are therefore introducing an ESG measure into the senior annual Bonus Plan performance framework weighted at 10%. We anticipate that the ESG measure will vary each year adapting to our evolving priorities in this area. In 2023 we will focus on safety which is identified as a current strategic priority taking into account our evolving capacity expansion. In addition, we have also strengthened the safety underpin which applies to the senior annual Bonus Plan.\n\nFlexibility in target setting framework - Our senior annual Bonus Plan profit target has also been set using a consistent and distinctive framework, focused on sustainable year-on-year growth rather than a range around the annual budget and we intend to continue with this approach. We propose to introduce additional flexibility into the target setting framework taking into account the potential for increased volatility in profits which may arise from time to time (for example, as seen in the COVID-19 vaccine contract) and therefore avoiding disincentivising over performance.\n\n## Response to shareholder consultation\n\nMost shareholders we engaged with appeared comfortable with our proposals to increase incentive opportunity, given Croda's performance to date, our strategic ambitions and our growth trajectory since the last Policy review. Shareholders also recognised that the incentive opportunities continued to be modest against the market.\n\nThe increases to shareholding guidelines were also welcomed, however some shareholders gave feedback that they would like to see an increase in our post-employment shareholding requirement which is currently set at 100% of the in-employment guideline for the first year after leaving employment, tapering to 0% by the end of year two. Responding to this feedback we will increase the requirement to 100% of the in-employment guideline for the full two years post-employment.\n\nThere were some clarifications about when the increase to additional annual bonus headroom might be used in exceptional circumstances. We have modified our proposal so that this headroom would only be available for use in the case of recruitment.\n\nFinally, a number of shareholders expressed a desire for a specific Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) metric in either the short or long-term incentive plans. Our discretion framework does include ROIC and therefore the Committee considers the performance alongside a range of other measures before either the senior annual Bonus Plan or PSP awards are approved. However, listening to this request we have now included ROIC as a specific underpin in our PSP. In addition, ROIC remains part of the discretion framework for our senior annual Bonus Plan.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Performance framework for 2023\n\nCroda's strategy continues to focus on consistently delivering sustainable, profitable growth by providing innovative, sustainable solutions to our customers consistent with our Purpose, Smart science to improve lives TM , and this is directly reflected in our performance measures and stretching targets.\n\nFor 2023, the senior annual Bonus Plan will continue to be largely based on an operating profit metric. In addition, an ESG measure with a weighting of 10% is being introduced as described above.\n\nThe PSP performance framework is unchanged in substance and will continue to include Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth (35% of the award), relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (35% of the award) and sustainability targets (30% of the award), within which 15% will be based on our innovation metric, New and Protected Products (NPP); those products that will drive our future growth. Innovating sustainably is core to Croda's success, and we continue to focus management on the delivery of this. The remaining 15% will be focused on selected KPIs aligned to the delivery of our 'Climate Positive' and 'People Positive' sustainability commitments.\n\nWe are making some changes to the bespoke peer group against which relative TSR is measured to better reflect the strategic focus of the business following our divestment. The NPP measure has been simplified and will now focus simply on growth in NPP over the performance period. Further details are contained on page 110.\n\nPerformance is always considered holistically; each year the Committee applies a Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment of other measures of corporate performance.\n\n## Consideration of wider workforce and alignment of reward across the organisation\n\nOur approach to workforce reward is an important part of Croda's philosophy. We are particularly sensitive at this time to the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on our wider workforce. One of the principles of Croda's culture is to drive 'One Croda', and therefore many of the remuneration structures that apply to the Executive Directors already also apply further in the global organisation. Highlights of our approach to workforce pay include:\n\n- \u00b7 Our commitment to the Global Living Wage - In 2021 Croda established a Living Wage in each of the countries in which it operates and ensured that all employees receive this as a minimum. We are now working with the Fair Wage Network to gain accreditation for our work in this area and to ensure our progress stands up to external scrutiny.\n- \u00b7 Sharing success across the business via our Free Share Plan and other all-employee plans - Launched in 2021, under the Free Share Plan all employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus Plan are gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior annual Bonus Plan pays out. In May 2022, all eligible employees (c.5,150 in total) were gifted 10 Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) which at the time of the award amounted to a value of \u00a3761.\n\nAround 81% of our UK workforce and 56% globally participate in share plans operated by the Company and therefore benefit from the rewards enjoyed by all shareholders.\n\n- \u00b7 Our CARE defined benefit pension - This applies across our entire UK workforce and is a generous and inclusive benefit. Under the CARE pension scheme the Company bears all of the investment risk and the security for our workforce is an important part of our 'One Croda' culture. In 2022 we were due to implement planned increases to employee contributions but in light of the cost-of-living crisis these increases were not implemented. Croda now pays an average contribution of 28% of salary per employee to fund the scheme.\n\nMore recently and in direct response to the cost-of-living crisis initiatives have focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced health and wellbeing benefits for all UK employees - In response to the cost-of-living crisis and concerns about accessing health care we have extended private health care through BUPA to all our UK employees and their families and now offer three-year private medical assessments to all UK employees.\n- \u00b7 Cost-of-living actions across Croda businesses - We have implemented a range of actions across the business to help address the cost-of-living crisis including one-off payments, improved benefits and mid-cycle annual increases. For example, in the US, we have given all employees a one-off $1,500 bonus, which has favoured employees on lower salaries. Elsewhere, at the beginning of 2022, we made an 'across the board' 5% increase for the entire UK workforce.\n\nIn line with our 'One Croda' culture, our senior leaders all share the same performance metrics for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. Around 500 employees participate in the senior annual Bonus Plan and 70 of these are also in the PSP. We believe that this focuses our leadership on working together globally to deliver the best overall outcome for our customers and, in turn, our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nOur policy review extended to a wider review of our management incentives, taking into account our strategic objective of a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences business. As a result of our wider review, bonus potential for other employees, who are members of bonus plans, will also be increased in 2023.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThrough our regular Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey we ask employees about their views on a range of topics. As part of the March 2022 survey, employees were asked how they feel they are valued and rewarded at Croda and the findings of this were presented to the Remuneration Committee as part of the information considered for the policy review.\n\nOverall employees felt valued by Croda and appreciated the work we have done to extend flexible working, however, there was concern about the fairness of the overall reward package.",

        "page_content": "In response, as described above, consistent with our proposals for Executive Directors, we have also increased the maximum annual bonus opportunity for employees. We have also stepped-up salary benchmarking locally to ensure we continue to provide a competitive package to our global workforce.\n\nIn addition, myself and other members of the Board meet regularly with employees to discuss a range of issues including reward and we have a dedicated email address where employees can email me directly about any questions or concerns, they may have in relation to their own or Executive reward.\n\n## Remuneration out-turn for 2022\n\n2022 was a record year for Croda exceeding \u00a32 billion of sales and \u00a3500 million of adjusted operating profit. This was driven by the strength of our operating model, which enabled continued recovery of unprecedented cost inflation, and the ongoing successful implementation of our strategy.\n\nConsumer Care achieved record sales up 18% and saw expanded sales of our sustainable technologies, increased geographic coverage in fragrances and continued profit growth. The increasing depth and diversity of our Life Sciences portfolio delivered 19% sales growth with a strong result in Crop Protection, whilst Pharma built on an exceptional 2021 performance and is developing an extensive pipeline of non-COVID applications.\n\nBonusable Profit, which includes profit from our divested PTIC business but with the base year adjusted to ensure like-for-like comparison and adjustment for the lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract, exceeded the outcome for 2021 and the maximum pay-out target. Reassuringly the maximum pay-out target would have been met even if PTIC profits had been excluded from the calculations. The Committee used the Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that this performance was robust and sustainable by reviewing underlying performance. The Committee determined that 100% of the senior annual Bonus Plan was payable.\n\nCroda's longer-term performance in profitable growth and TSR was also strong and reflected the long-term growth trajectory of the business. 2022 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2020 concluded their three-year period, and the Committee reviewed performance for the targets that were set at that time.\n\nOver the period TSR performance was 45.4%, placing Croda in the top quartile against our bespoke comparator group with 100% of this part of the award vesting. Our strong profit performance led to EPS growth of 47.5% which resulted in a 100% vesting of this part of the award. EPS was adjusted for the divestment of the majority of the PTIC business. The outcome was not impacted by this adjustment.\n\nNPP growth also met the stretching vesting target, growing by 2.24 times non-NPP sales over the period, and therefore full vesting will be achieved for this target, worth 20% of the overall award. 2020 was the first year in which we introduced sustainability targets both relating to our Climate Positive ambitions; including the development of decarbonisation roadmaps and scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions. Both targets were met, and vesting will be at maximum for these targets.\n\nThe Committee considered this, the EVA underpin, and a range of broader performance criteria using the Discretion Framework and concluded that the PSP awards were consistent with and reflective of overall financial performance over the time period. Therefore, after consideration of all factors, an overall PSP vesting of 100% of the total award was agreed.\n\n## Transition of Chief Financial Officer\n\nJez Maiden will retire as Group Finance Director of Croda in 2023 and will be succeeded by Louisa Burdett as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nLouisa Burdett was appointed on a salary of \u00a3520,000 and will participate in both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP on the same basis as Jez Maiden. There was no sign-on bonus or buy-out.\n\nRemuneration arrangements for Jez Maiden on his retirement were managed in line with the Remuneration Policy. As he was never a member of the Croda Pension Scheme no pension is payable. Further details are provided within this Report.\n\n## Salaries for 2023\n\nFor 2023 there will be a general increase for our UK employees of 7%. In addition a one-off supplement payment of \u00a31,500 will be paid in two instalments in January and June 2023 to help address energy prices. The payment of a non-consolidated fixed amount has favoured employees on lower salaries. Overall, the budget for salary increases for all UK employees has increased by over 9%.\n\nRecognising advice from our shareholders for restraint regarding Executive pay, our Executive Directors will receive an increase in salary of 4% and will not receive the one-off supplement. This increase will not apply to our newly appointed CFO who is not eligible to receive an increase until January 2024. Increases awarded to our Executive Committee are also below that of the UK workforce.\n\nA review of the Chair fees was also undertaken and, reflecting similar principles to those applied to our Executive Directors whilst also recognising the continuing high time commitment, an increase of 4% was awarded.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy will be voted on by our shareholders at our 2023 AGM. As stated above we have listened to the views of our many shareholders through consultation and are hopeful they are able to support our proposals.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring that our remuneration framework reflects the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJacqui Ferguson, Remuneration Committee Chair",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## C. Proposed Remuneration Policy\n\n## 1) Overview of the new Remuneration Policy including Executive Directors' remuneration for the year ending 31 December 2023\n\nOur proposed Remuneration Policy will be presented to shareholders at the 2023 AGM and is intended to operate for three years until the AGM in 2026.\n\nIn reviewing the Policy, the Committee has considered the following principal objectives to:\n\n- \u00b7  Achieve the closest possible alignment with the Company's evolving strategy to become a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences business;\n- \u00b7  Support the Company's ambition to be a purpose led organisation focused on Smart science to improve lives\u2122 and an industry leader in sustainability;\n- \u00b7  Ensure that business performance is appropriately measured and rewarded and that the scale of reward is proportionate;\n- \u00b7  Make certain that the Policy properly reflects the various interests of all our stakeholders in its structure and metrics;\n- \u00b7  Ensure that the Policy is fair and competitive and that it also considers reward more broadly in the organisation; and\n- \u00b7  Disclose the Policy in an open and transparent way.\n\nThe evolution in the Group's strategy, following the divestment of the PTIC businesses, and the increased size and complexity of the business was a key focus for the Committee when considering changes to the Remuneration Policy. In advance of finalising the proposals an extensive shareholder consultation exercise was undertaken, as described in the letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair. Feedback received as part of this process resulted in modifications to proposals.\n\nThe Committee's method of operation will be flexible and dynamic taking account of external changes and business performance.\n\n## Main changes to the Remuneration Policy\n\nIt is proposed to make changes to the Policy and application of the Policy in five key areas:\n\n- 1. Against the background of strong business performance, increased complexity and evolving talent needs, we are proposing an increase to the maximum annual bonus of 25% of base salary and an increase to the maximum PSP also of 25% of base salary.\n- 2. Increasing shareholding guidelines in line with the increased PSP opportunity and extending post-employment shareholding requirements to apply in full over the two years, rather than on a tapered basis during this period.\n- 3. Increasing the maximum annual bonus headroom to 200% of base salary to provide some additional flexibility but only in exceptional circumstances of recruitment.\n- 4. Introduction of an ESG metric into the senior annual Bonus Plan to align with our strategy to be industry leaders in sustainability.\n\n- 5. Introduction of additional flexibility into the senior annual Bonus Plan target setting framework taking into account the potential for increased volatility in profits which may arise from time to time (e.g. profit from our lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract).\n\nThe remainder of this section provides the context and details to these changes.\n\n## 1. For both Executive Directors, an increase to the maximum annual bonus of 25% of base salary and an increase to the maximum PSP of 25% of base salary.\n\nOver the last three years Croda's market capitalisation has increased from c.\u00a36.6bn to c.\u00a39.2bn, creating c.\u00a32.6bn of value for shareholders, and we are now a FTSE 50 company. We have also become an increasingly complex and international business. Against that background we are proposing increases to our incentives.\n\nWhile our approach to remuneration has never been driven by benchmarking, our view is that this proposed increase in incentive opportunity is aligned to shareholder interests to support the next phase of the Group's strategic development.\n\n|              |     | Current   | Proposed   |\n|--------------|-----|-----------|------------|\n| Annual bonus | CEO | 150%      | 175%       |\n|              | CFO | 125%      | 150%       |\n| PSP          | CEO | 225%      | 250%       |\n| PSP          | CFO | 175%      | 200%       |\n\nThe benchmarking, undertaken as part of the Remuneration Policy review process, suggested that it was the annual bonus opportunity in particular which has fallen significantly below market for a company of our size and there was case for an increase to annual bonus opportunity. However, we were keen to continue with an incentive structure heavily weighted to the long-term. For this reason, we are proposing that our annual bonus is increased relatively modestly (+25% of base salary), but that PSP is also increased (+25% of base salary). The resultant incentive levels continue to be relatively conservative against the benchmarks.\n\n## 2. Increasing shareholding guidelines in line with the increased PSP opportunity and extending postemployment shareholding requirements to apply in full over the two years, rather than on a tapered basis during this period.\n\nShareholding guidelines will continue to be set in line with 'normal' PSP awards; in line with the proposal above, levels for 2023 would increase:\n\n|     | Current  shareholding  requirements   | New  shareholding  requirements   |\n|-----|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| CEO | 225%                                  | 250%                              |\n| CFO | 175%                                  | 200%                              |\n\nWe also propose to extend the post-employment shareholding requirements , requiring Executive Directors to retain 100% of the shareholding guideline for two years after leaving the Company.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Increasing the maximum annual bonus headroom to 200% of base salary to provide some additional flexibility but only in exceptional circumstances of recruitment.\n\nWe are proposing additional annual bonus headroom (maximum 200% of salary) in the Policy which would only be permitted to be used in exceptional circumstances of recruitment.\n\n## 4. Introduction of an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metric into the senior annual Bonus Plan to align with our strategy to be industry leaders in sustainability.\n\nCurrently our senior annual Bonus Plan is based 100% on profit performance with no bonus payable until the previous year's profit is exceeded. Prior to the Remuneration Policy review we had received feedback from some shareholders that they would like to see additional measures introduced.\n\nFollowing our review, we concluded that, given the increased complexity of the business, as well as the proposed increase in annual bonus levels, it would be appropriate to introduce another measure in order to better reflect overall performance for all our stakeholders.\n\nWe are therefore introducing an ESG measure into the senior annual Bonus Plan performance framework weighted at 10%. We anticipate that the ESG measure will vary each year adapting to our evolving priorities in this area. Our goal is to ensure that it has impact across the organisation. Our senior annual Bonus Plan cascades through our organisation (c.500 participants) and therefore we see this as an opportunity to signal and drive forward ESG priorities. For example, in future years we may include a target related to our climate priorities where we see opportunities for a target to drive forward a specific priority or initiative in a particular year.\n\nIn 2023, however, we will focus on safety which is identified as a current strategic priority taking into account our evolving capacity expansion. The proposed safety measure for 2023 is in relation to the whole population of eligible employees, and the extent to which the population:\n\n- 1. Completes one specifically defined SHE leadership behaviour objective.\n- 2. Completes specified face to face (or virtual) safety training.\n- 3. Completes and documents at least one safety focused visit and conversation to demonstrate safety is a value through organisation engagement and risk management.\n\nPayment schedule to be 100% pay out if 98% of eligible employees complete all three tasks and 50% pay out if 95% of eligible employees complete all three tasks. For clarity this is not an individual measure - if less than 95% of eligible employees complete the three tasks no payment to any employee will be made. In addition, we have also strengthened the safety underpin which applies to the senior annual Bonus Plan. The strengthened safety underpin requires the Committee to actively consider a number factors, including but not limited to compliance with the requirements or minimum standards set out in the Croda SHE Manual, any incidents resulting in a fatality, serious injury or material environmental impact, and progress during the year on SHE focus areas.\n\n## 5. Introduction of additional flexibility into the senior annual Bonus Plan target setting framework\n\nOur senior annual Bonus Plan profit targets have been set using a consistent and distinctive framework, focused on year-on-year sustainable growth rather than a range around the annual budget, and we intend to continue with this approach. However, we propose to introduce additional flexibility into the target setting framework taking into account the potential for increased volatility in profits which may arise from time to time (e.g. profit from our lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract) to avoid disincentivising over performance. In normal circumstances, we will continue with an approach of setting bonus targets based on pre-determined growth percentages on prior year performance. However, in circumstances where the prior year profit is considered to be unusually high, bonus targets for the following year will not necessarily be set based on a simple formula of growth on prior year. Nevertheless, in all cases, targets will be set at the beginning of the year, in line with normal practice.\n\n## Other changes in implementation of the PSP framework\n\nNo substantive changes are proposed to our PSP framework, which will continue to be based on EPS, relative TSR and sustainability performance. We are however proposing a number of additional modifications:\n\n## ROIC underpin\n\nA number of shareholders expressed a desire for a specific ROIC metric in either the short or long-term incentive plans. Our Discretion Framework does include ROIC, but taking onboard this feedback, going forward we have included ROIC as a specific underpin in our PSP. This will replace the previous EVA underpin.\n\nAwards will be subject to a ROIC underpin such that vesting is subject to satisfactory ROIC performance over the three-year performance period, as determined by the Committee. In determining whether the underpin has been met, the Committee will consider a range of factors including, but not limited to, the intended time horizons for returns on capital deployed, and the achievement of Croda's long-term ROIC objective which is currently set at 2x cost of capital.\n\nROIC will also remain part of the Discretion Framework for the senior annual Bonus Plan.",

It is however proposed that this measure is modified so that it is based on growth in NPP, rather than growth relative to non-NPP sales:\n\n| Current NPP metric                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Proposed NPP metric                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NPP sales to grow at twice the  rate of non-NPP, subject to overall  positive Group profit growth and   a minimum average of 3% NPP  growth per year (25% vesting),  with payments being made on a  sliding scale up to 5% growth per | Subject to overall positive Group  profit growth and a minimum  average of 3% NPP growth   per year (25% vesting), with  payments being made on a  sliding scale up to 7% growth   per year (maximum vesting). |\n\nThis modification has been made in order to simplify the NPP measure, reflect the importance of our non-NPP sales, especially those relating to sustainable products, and to reflect that the current relative measure could penalise management for a strong performance in non-NPP sales.\n\n## Other elements of PSP EPS measure\n\nOur EPS growth target will remain at 5% to 11% average growth over a three-year period. This target aligns to our ambitious strategic plan of consistent organic sales and margin growth and has long-term inflation assumptions built in. The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to adjust for the impact of acquisitions. We target mid single digit organic growth in Consumer Care and high single digit growth in Life Sciences, with underlying growth in Industrial Specialties at GDP levels but offset by a gradual exit from some supply agreements. With current margins maintained this would deliver an EPS growth of broadly 5%. With margin improvement targeted through better business mix and innovation, this drives EPS growth higher. EPS growth of 11% would represent over performance of our strategic plan. Overall, and in this context, the Committee considered that the targets remained proportional and stretching.\n\n## Sustainability measures\n\nAs an industry leader in sustainability, we will continue with sustainability measures for our 2023 awards. For this year measures will be aligned to our Climate and People Positive strategy:\n\n- \u00b7  Climate Positive - Scope 3 emissions make up more than 85% of Croda's corporate emissions inventory and have the greatest impact on the carbon footprint we pass on to customers through our ingredients. Therefore to achieve the required emission reductions, it is imperative that we move to target reductions to our Scope 3 emissions. It is for this reason that our measure this year is strongly aligned to the specific actions which will support reducing our upstream Scope 3 emissions. Our target is based on (i) completion of net zero roadmaps to 2050 for technology platforms covering >90% of Scope 1, 2 and upstream Scope 3 emissions and (ii) completion of all actions arising from roadmaps in the period to end 2025.\n- \u00b7  People Positive - a target aimed at improving Croda's Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) score, a measure of Croda's intentional actions to create a positive environment in which colleagues can successfully create sustainable innovation.",

In addition, a one-off supplement payment of \u00a31,500 will be paid in two instalments in January and June 2023 to help address energy prices. The payment of a non-consolidated fixed amount has meant our employees on lower salaries have received a greater proportional benefit. Overall, the budget for cost-of-living increases for all UK employees has increased by over 9%.\n- \u00b7  Recognising advice from our shareholders for restraint with regard to Executive pay, our Executive Directors have received an increase in salary of 4%.

Over the three-year performance period the target is an increase in the PSC score by 8 percentage points over the 2022 baseline 3 , to achieve a Croda Employee Satisfaction (ESAT) score of 4.0 (Good). This will be underpinned by a continued high response rate by employees, set at 65% of global headcount 4 . Awards will be paid in the following defined ranges:\n\n- \u00b7  Increase PSC score by 8ppts, and 65% response for max vesting\n- \u00b7  Increase PSC score by 6ppts, and 65% response for 75% vesting\n- \u00b7  Increase PSC score by 4ppts, and 65% response for 50% vesting\n- \u00b7  Increase PSC score by 2ppts, and 65% response for 25% vesting, with no vesting below this.\n\nAwards will be subject to a ROIC underpin such that vesting is subject to satisfactory ROIC performance over the three-year performance period, as determined by the Committee. In determining whether the underpin has been met, the Committee will consider a range of factors including, but not limited to, the intended time horizons for returns on capital deployed, and the achievement of Croda's long-term ROIC objective which is currently set at 2x cost of capital.\n\n- 1. EPS growth p.a. is calculated on a simple average basis over the three-year period and therefore growth of 33% or more over three years is required for maximum vesting. The calculation of base EPS for EPS growth has been adjusted for the divestment of the majority of the PTIC business.\n- 2. Updated TSR Group: Akzo Nobel, Ashland, Avantor, BASF, Catalent, Chr. Hansen, Clariant, Elementis, Evonik, Givaudan, IFF, Johnson Matthey, Kerry, DSM, Lonza, Merck, Novozymes, Solvay, Symrise, Synthomer, Tate & Lyle and Victrex\n- 3. The PSC score uses a 5 point scoring methodology. Croda's PSC score for 2022 was 68% or 3.5 with an average participation rate of 77%. An increase in the PSC score of 8ppts would move the score to 75% or 4.\n- 4. The number of responses to the survey also matters, and therefore, an underpin for vesting to occur is set at 65% of global headcount having responded to the survey. Global headcount to be calculated based on the in-quarter figures at the point that a survey is first deployed and should aim to include any new acquisitions, with discretion given for initial integration period into organisation defined as 12 months.\n\n## Commentary\n\n- \u00b7  Maximum award levels have increased by 25ppts from last year.\n- \u00b7  Jez Maiden will not receive an award in 2023 due to his planned retirement.\n- \u00b7  ROIC underpin replaces the EVA underpin.\n- \u00b7  Performance period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025.\n- \u00b7  An additional two-year holding period will apply for any shares vesting.\n- \u00b7  No change to the balance of sustainability metrics from last year. NPP and sustainability targets remain equally weighted at 15% of the total PSP. Sustainability targets aligned to key 2030 sustainability ambitions.\n- \u00b7  When assessing outcomes, the Committee applies the Discretion Framework which considers, for example, the management of EVA and ROIC, health and safety and sales growth and may adjust awards if it considers appropriate.\n- \u00b7  Malus and clawback provisions apply.",

It would be intended to operate until its expiration at the Company's 2026 AGM.\n\nThe Policy was developed over the course of 2022 and early 2023. The Committee undertook a thorough review of arrangements with a particular focus on alignment to Croda's forward strategy and aspirations. Input was received from the Chair and management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were suitably mitigated. The Committee also considered carefully corporate governance developments. Input was provided by the Committee's appointed independent advisers throughout the process.\n\nExtensive shareholder consultation was undertaken during the second half of the year in good time for shareholder input to feed into the finalisation of proposals in early 2023.\n\n## Remuneration Policy table\n\nThe table below sets out the main components of Croda's Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors:\n\n## Framework used to assess performance and for the recovery of sums paid\n\n| Operation                                                                                                                       | Maximum opportunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basic salary - to assist in the recruitment and retention of high-calibre Executives                                            | Basic salary - to assist in the recruitment and retention of high-calibre Executives                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Basic salary - to assist in the recruitment and retention of high-calibre Executives                                                                       |\n| Normally reviewed annually with  increases effective from 1 January.

The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Who participates in the plans\n- \u00b7  The timing of grant of award and/or payment\n- \u00b7  The size of an award and/or payment\n- \u00b7  The determination of vesting\n- \u00b7  Dealing with a change of control (e.g. the timing and basis of testing performance targets), restructuring, or other corporate event\n- \u00b7  Determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen\n- \u00b7  Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends)\n- \u00b7  The annual review of performance conditions for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP\n- \u00b7  For DBSP, the extension of the length of the deferral period.\n\nAll discretions available under share plan rules will be available under this Policy, except where explicitly limited under this Policy.\n\nThe Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings for the senior annual Bonus Plan and for the PSP if events occur (e.g. material divestment of a Group business or changes to accounting standards) which cause it to determine that an adjustment or amendment is appropriate so that the conditions achieve their original purpose.\n\nThe Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy to aid its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approvals (e.g. for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation).\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the 2014 AGM (the date the Company's first shareholder-approved Directors' Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before this Policy came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholderapproved Directors' Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting\n\nUnder the senior annual Bonus Plan, an underlying profit-based objective such as profit growth will be used as the primary performance metric. Such a measure will be used as it aligns to growth in underlying profitability of the Group. The current profit-based measure also incentivises the efficient use of working capital. Sustainability metrics align with our strategy to be industry leaders in sustainability. Other metrics may be used in the future where it is considered that they provide clear alignment with the evolving strategy of the Group.\n\nIn terms of long-term performance targets, PSP awards vest subject to:\n\n- \u00b7  financial targets (e.g. EPS growth) that are informed by the Group's long-term financial ambitions (e.g. long-term targeted earnings growth);\n- \u00b7  shareholder return targets (e.g. relative TSR) which provide clear alignment of interests between shareholders and Executives; and\n- \u00b7  strategic targets (e.g. New and Protected Products (NPP) and sustainability targets) that align to our long-term strategic ambitions (e.g. commitment to being sustainability leaders, and to grow through innovation).\n\nThe Committee retains the discretion to adjust both the measures and weightings (including to 0%) for each PSP award, subject to the broad framework in the Policy table above.\n\nFinancial and shareholder return targets (e.g. profit growth for the senior annual Bonus Plan and EPS growth and relative TSR for the PSP) are set based on sliding scales that take account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Group. In relation to strategic targets or underpin targets, the structure of the target will vary based on the nature of the target set. Targets and underpins may be set which provide for Committee judgement in assessing the extent to which they have been met.\n\nIn addition, prior to the determination of final outcomes, the Committee will apply its Discretion Framework to enhance the rigour and consistency of any payments and to ensure they truly align to overall Group performance and the wider stakeholder experience. While the Committee anticipates that any such discretion would normally result in a reduction, the Committee reserves the right to make an upwards adjustment if considered appropriate.\n\nOnly modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of the challenging plans approved at the start of each year. The Committee may reduce (but not increase) the percentage of an award that is capable of vesting for threshold performance set out in the Remuneration Policy table.",

In addition, where necessary, the Committee may  approve the payment of additional benefits to facilitate recruitment (e.g. relocation expenses).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Pension                | Pension in accordance with the current policy. For an internal promotion, any legacy defined benefit pension  arrangements would be considered on a case by case basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Annual bonus           | The annual bonus would operate in accordance with the current policy, with a maximum opportunity no greater  than the 200% of salary exceptional limit set out in the Policy table. For the first year the annual bonus would be  pro-rated for the period of employment as appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-term incentives   | Share awards will be granted in accordance with the current policy in terms of maximum opportunity and  performance targets. An award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being  in a prohibited period). For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period  and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Buy-out awards         | In the case of an external hire it may be necessary to buy-out incentive pay, benefit or other contractual  arrangements (including in relation to the forfeiture of such amounts on leaving the previous employer). Any such  buy-out would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and performance conditions  of the remuneration being forfeited. Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company's  existing share plans within the limits detailed in the Remuneration Policy table. Awards may also be granted  outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules. |\n\n## Directors' service contracts and payments for loss of office\n\nExecutive Directors' service contracts are permanent and terminable by the Company on at least 12 months' notice and by the Director on at least six months' notice, save on retirement where the Director must give at least 12 months' notice to the Company.\n\nIn respect of termination, the Committee's policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time. In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant Director's current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.\n\nThe principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car or car allowance, private fuel allowance, pension, medical insurance, life assurance and, in the case of the new CFO, a travel allowance. Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.\n\nThe Committee's policy is for contracts to contain provisions which enable the Company to terminate contracts at any time with immediate effect. The Executive Director would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to up to 12 months' salary plus the value of their pension benefits (currently valued at 20% of basic salary) and the value of other benefits, payable in a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments over the full notice period or, if less, the remainder of any notice period not yet completed. Such payments would normally discontinue or reduce to the extent that alternative employment is obtained.\n\nAn Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct. No payment or compensation beyond sums accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.\n\nPayments may be made in respect of the Director's legal and/or professional advice fees in connection with their cessation of office or employment and/or fees for outplacement assistance. Payments may be made in respect of accrued but untaken holiday.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\nOther than in the event of a good leaver circumstance, at the discretion of the Committee, no bonus may be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date. In the event that an individual does cease employment as a good leaver, bonuses would become payable subject to performance assessment, and pro-rata based on the number of complete calendar days worked in the relevant year. A portion of any bonus payable will normally be deferred into shares in line with normal policy. Good leaver circumstances include circumstances such as death, injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company or business, retirement with the Company's agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the time).\n\nThe treatment for DBSP awards previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules. DBSP awards will normally subsist, except in the circumstance where an individual is summarily dismissed. The default treatment is that deferred shares will be delivered at the normal time, although the Committee may permit the awards to vest earlier.\n\nThe treatment for PSP awards previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules. The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment. In relation to awards granted under the PSP, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company or business, retirement with the Company's agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the time) 'good leaver' status applies. If treated as a good leaver, awards will be eligible to vest subject to performance conditions, which will be measured over the performance period (unless the Committee permits the award to vest at an earlier date) and will be reduced pro-rata (unless the Committee considers it appropriate not to do so) to reflect the proportion of the period between grant and normal vesting date actually served.\n\nTreatment of shares awarded under HMRC all-employee plans or equivalent will be in line with the share plan rules.\n\nTreatment of incentive awards in the event of a change of control or similar corporate event will be in line with the relevant plan rules.\n\n## Shareholding guidelines\n\nThe Committee operates share ownership guidelines which apply to all Executive Directors and the Group Executive Committee. The Group Chief Executive is subject to a share ownership guideline of 250% of salary and the other Executive Directors to 200% of salary.\n\nIt is expected that the guideline will be met within a five-year time period from its adoption (or date of joining for new appointments) through a combination of share purchases and the retention of incentive shares. On the exercise of Sharesave options or the vesting of awards from the Company's long-term incentive plans, Executives are required to retain shares awarded representing 50% of the net of tax gain until the ownership target is met or exceeded. The Committee retains discretion to determine shares which count towards the share ownership guidelines.\n\nExecutive Directors will also normally be required to retain a shareholding for two years after leaving the Company. They will be required to retain 100% of their shareholding guideline (or the actual shareholding of relevant shares on leaving, if lower) for two years after leaving employment. This policy will apply only to awards that vest in 2020 and beyond. The Committee has the discretion to waive this requirement in certain circumstances (e.g. compassionate circumstances). Jez Maiden is due to step down from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2023 and retire on 31 May 2023. Following his departure he will be subject to the previous tapered two-year share retention requirements in the 2020 Policy.\n\n## External appointments\n\nExecutive Directors may accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board. It is normal practice for Executive Directors to retain fees provided for non-executive director appointments.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nThe Chair and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice. In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement. Non-Executive Directors have no entitlement to contractual termination payments. While not anticipated, the Policy allows flexibility to pay a notice payment if considered appropriate. The dates of the initial appointments of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.",

The key difference is that, overall, the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership, than for other employees.\n\nBase salaries are operated under the same policy as detailed in the Remuneration Policy table with any comparator groups used as a reference point, being country and/or industry specific. The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader Group and, in particular the UK-based employees when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors. The performance related bonus scheme operates on a tiered basis from 175% of salary down to 22% of salary across the most senior global grades. Outside of the most senior tiers of Executives, the PSP is not operated as this arrangement is reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence Group level performance.\n\nHowever, the Committee believes in wider employee share ownership and promotes this through the operation of the HMRC tax approved all-employee share schemes which are open to all UK employees. Other similar share schemes are offered in other jurisdictions where local securities laws allow.\n\nExecutive Director pensions are aligned with the UK workforce and are typically provided either through (i) participation in the UK's defined benefit pension plan with a cash supplement provided above any pension salary cap or (ii) a cash supplement provided in lieu of pension. The UK workforce defined benefit pension plan is a generous and inclusive benefit for our UK workforce.\n\n## How the views of employees are taken into account\n\nThe Group has a diverse workforce operating globally in 39 different countries, with various local pay practices. The President Human Resources updates the Committee periodically on feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group. In developing this Remuneration Policy, the Committee devoted time at the outset in considering the principles which apply to remuneration across the workforce. This included consideration of the 'One Croda' culture, as well as Croda's values and purpose. While the views of the global workforce were not explicitly sought during the process, alignment across the workforce was a key theme of the review.\n\n## How the views of shareholders are taken into account\n\nIn developing this Remuneration Policy, the Committee undertook an extensive shareholder consultation exercise, and the Chair of the Committee met with key shareholders to discuss the principles for the review and initial proposals. The Committee also considered emerging shareholder views in key governance areas. Feedback received during the consultation period was taken into account when developing the final Remuneration Policy and modifications were made to the proposed Policy. An overview of the shareholder consultation process is outlined on pages 102 & 103 of the 2022 Annual Report.",

How our reward strategy aligns to and supports the delivery of our business strategy\n\nOver the last two years we have accelerated key elements of our strategy to transition to a dedicated Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. Across these markets, innovation and sustainability will be the core drivers of our future growth.\n\nIn developing and implementing our Remuneration Policy the Committee has been mindful to ensure that every element of reward directly aligns to our strategy, ensuring we provide and protect long-term shareholder value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Element  of reward                      | Link to strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Sustainability   | Innovation   | Growth   | Long-term  shareholder  value   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|----------|---------------------------------|\n| Senior annual Bonus Plan                | Senior annual Bonus Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                  |              |          |                                 |\n| Profit                                  | Clear and simple measure that supports our  strategic objective of consistent bottom-line growth.

How our Remuneration Policy reflects the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen developing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee was mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code and considers that the executive remuneration framework appropriately addresses the following factors:\n\n| Factors         | How these are addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity         | Our commitment to openness and transparency are reflected in our reward principles. The Committee is committed to  providing open and transparent disclosure on executive remuneration for our stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Simplicity      | Our executive remuneration arrangements, as well as those throughout the global organisation, are simple in nature and well  understood by both participants and shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                 | Our senior annual Bonus Plan, in which around 500 of our global employees participate, is primarily based on a single profit  metric, with a simple key requirement that no bonus can be paid for this element until the previous year's profit is exceeded.                                                                                                                       |\n| Risk            | The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.  Performance is based on a balance of metrics which also reflect our broader stakeholders, for example inclusion  of sustainability targets and health and safety underpins. We then take a holistic assessment of performance using  our Discretion Framework. |\n|                 | Annual bonus deferral, the PSP holding period and our shareholding guidelines provide a clear link to the ongoing  performance of the business as well as alignment with shareholders. Executives will be rewarded for sustainable long-term  shareholder return.                                                                                                                  |\n|                 | Malus and clawback provisions also apply for both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Predictability  | Our Remuneration Policy contains details of maximum opportunity levels for each component of pay, with actual incentive  outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Proportionality | Our Remuneration Policy directly aligns to our strategy and financial performance. The Committee considers performance  from a range of perspectives. Poor financial performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe it is important to our culture and our values to have an active dialogue with employees on topics such as reward, recognition, motivation, wellbeing, safety, and inclusion. Therefore, in 2022, we have broadened our engagement by building on established channels such as Pulse Surveys and the dedicated email for\n\nemployees to contact the Chair of the Committee. The Culture Pulse Surveys engage across the organisation and create an opportunity to gain feedback on the listening groups held during the year, including those attended by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. A survey on reward and recognition, that included questions on understanding total reward offered to employees, and whether employees felt valued was undertaken in February 2022. A summary of engagement activities undertaken to date is as follows:\n\n| Reward  principles                      | Our reward principles, which were developed and approved during 2019, guide the way we recognise and remunerate  all our global employees. These principles focus on total reward including intangible rewards and were strongly  influenced by the results of our previous Global Employee Survey. These have been shared across the organisation.   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employee  pulse surveys                 | In 2022 a number of pulse surveys covering a range of topics, including culture and reward, were undertaken and  findings were shared with the Board as well as management to help guide decisions.                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Listening  groups                       | During 2022 the Chair of the Board and other Non-Executive Directors attended listening groups to better understand  how employees were feeling on a range of different topics, including reward.                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Dedicated  email to Chair  of Committee | A dedicated email address has been established for employees to send comments or questions to the Chair of the  Remuneration Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Overview of  pay and policy  decisions  | Committee members are updated annually on global employees' terms and conditions and are made aware of any  significant changes to policies and other pay-related matters.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## How our Remuneration Policy relates to reward in the wider employee context\n\nWhen making decisions about executive remuneration the Committee considers the pay and reward structures across the business. Annually, the President Human Resources provides the Committee with a review of workforce remuneration, and the Committee is updated periodically on any feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.\n\nOne of the principles of Croda's culture is to drive 'One Croda', therefore, many of the remuneration structures that apply to Executives also apply further in the global organisation, as set out in the table on the next page. The key difference between the policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees is that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership.",

Other pension arrangements, aligned to local practice and legislation, are available in many of our locations.\n- 3. A range of health care benefits are also available in many of our locations globally.\n\n## 4. Sharing success across the business\n\nThe Committee believes in sharing success across the business and extending share ownership more widely across our employee base. This is promoted through the operation of a new 'Free Share Plan' and a number of all-employee share schemes.\n\n## Response to cost-of-living-crisis\n\nIn response to the cost-of-living crisis and concerns about accessing health care, we extended private health care though Bupa to all our UK employees, with the Company also contributing 50% towards the cost of adding their families to the plan. As part of this provision, we now offer triennial private medical assessments to all employees. In addition one off payments were made to support UK employees with increases to fuel costs.\n\nIn countries outside of the UK we also provided one off payments and off cycle increases to support the cost of living crisis.\n\n## Free Share Plan\n\nIn 2021 we launched the 'Free Share Plan'. Under this new plan, all employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus Plan are gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior annual Bonus Plan pays out. Unlike other elements of remuneration this award is not set as a multiple of salary, instead it rewards all eligible employees at the same value.\n\nThe Free Share Plan was developed in response to findings from the Global Reward Survey in 2020 and aims to share success more widely across the business and encourage share ownership.\n\nAs the senior annual Bonus Plan paid out for 2022, all eligible employees will receive 10 Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) in May 2023 under the Free Share Plan. The value of the award is determined by the share price at vesting and based on the recent share price will be in the region of \u00a3684 (based on a share price of \u00a368.42 on 13 February 2023).",

In 2023, we will continue to ensure that all our UK employees and regular contractors are paid at, or above, the rates advised by the Living Wage Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the business continues to pursue its Global Living Wage target, one of our sustainability KPIs linked to the UN SDGs. In 2020 we forged a partnership with the Fair Wage Network (FWN) to establish, using an independent and economically rigorous methodology, Living Wage levels across the world. In 2021, we compared our global wage levels to Living Wage comparators provided by the FWN and made all necessary adjustments to ensure that all our employees are now paid a Living Wage at a minimum.\n\nWe reviewed our Living Wage levels in 2022 and made any adjustments necessary in order to continue paying a Living Wage to all employees. We are now working with the Fair Wage Network to gain accreditation for our work and to ensure our progress stands up to external scrutiny. In 2022 we also began the process of ensuring all our regular contractors are paid a Living Wage and plan to achieve this milestone by the end of 2023.\n\n## More than just pay\n\nOur employees and our culture remain central to the continued success of Croda. We continue to enhance our range of other workforce initiatives, including:\n\n- \u00b7  We are proud of the training and development that we provide for employees and have set a target of ensuring all employees receive at least one week of training a year by the end of 2025. In 2022, our employees undertook over 145,000 hours of training with the average number of hours an employee completed being 26 hours.\n- \u00b7  In 2021 we relaunched and redesigned our core company development programmes for senior leaders and future leaders with our values at their heart. 2022 was the first year many of these programmes have been able to run and all programmes have been positively received by employees.\n- \u00b7  In 2021 we also launched an inclusion based global leadership programme, Phoenix Rising. In 2022 this programme ran for a second time with participants from all over the world. We also ran a series of leadership webinars on diversity & inclusive leadership.\n- \u00b7  We recorded over 150 wellbeing activities which took place in 2022 and we continued with Employee Assistance Programmes in many of our countries. Each of our sites is tasked with ensuring at least four health and wellbeing events are run per year, with many sites running significantly more than this.\n\nSee pages 20 & 21 for further information on our culture including details on how we approach the recruitment, development and training of our workforce.\n\n## 5. Promoting diversity & inclusion\n\nBroad diversity, where different perspectives and experiences are able to create valuable innovation that improve lives, is critical to our long-term success as an innovative Company. We are committed to ensuring an inclusive workplace where everyone is able to have a successful and rewarding career.\n\nOur D&I Roadmap has guided our work in 2022, with a focus on raising awareness and reward and recognition. Our Global Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee and our regional and countrybased committees have continued to challenge the business in 2022 by raising awareness on a variety of topics, including disability, transgender inclusion, and being an ally. They have also organised activities to support Black History Month, Pride, and Ramadan.\n\nAs of December 2022, we continue to meet the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic diversity and have full gender balance on the Board.",

Other disclosures\n\n## UK gender pay gap\n\nThe table below shows a summary of the gender pay gap for UK employees of Croda Europe Ltd:\n\n|                   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mean pay gap      | 27.7%  | 27.1%  | 18.7%  | 17.7%  | 7.2%   |\n| Median pay gap    | 23.1%  | 23.9%  | 19.2%  | 21.1%  | 15.7%  |\n| Mean bonus gap    | 63.1%  | 67.1%  | 64.4%  | 62.6%  | 23.3%  |\n| Median bonus gap* | 33.3%  | 33.4%  | 0%     | 0%     | 29.9%  |\n\nWe are confident that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue but is a result of a lack of female representation across our business at senior levels and particularly in production roles which represent the bulk of the workforce between the 25 th and 75 th percentile. Addressing this issue will require a long-term approach but we have already begun work to increase the number of females working in production and in senior positions.\n\nThe number of women in leadership positions is now 38% (2021: 36%). We are also pleased to report that we have 59 (2021: 43) women working as process operators across 14 of our sites globally.\n\nOver 2022 42% of hires and promotions to leadership positions were female.\n\nOther actions taken to address the gender pay gap include:\n\n- \u00b7  Ensuring we have a balanced shortlist for all positions that we are recruiting for; we have a target of achieving balanced shortlists for 80% of roles by the end of 2023.\n- \u00b7  Further improving our talent and succession planning processes to help identify and nurture talent early in their career. In 2021 we relaunched our global talent development programmes and participants in 2022 have been gender balanced.\n- \u00b7  Finding ways to reduce shift work (especially night work) and to examine the feasibility of part-time and job share arrangements in our production facilities.\n- \u00b7  Changing the way we advertise production roles to ensure we reach a diverse population.\n- \u00b7  Improving family-friendly policies; in 2019 we introduced a new Global Parental Leave Policy and in 2020 we launched new Flexible Working guidance.

The pay ratios are calculated on a Group-wide basis by reference to UK employees only.\n\nUnder the regulations, there are three methodologies that companies can choose to report their pay ratio, known as Option A, B and C. For 2022 we have chosen to continue to use the Government's preferred option, Option A. Using this methodology, we have determined the full-time equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees and have ranked this data to identify employees whose remuneration places them at the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile. The pay ratios are then calculated by comparing total remuneration for these three employees against our CEO 'single figure' total remuneration.\n\n|           | Methodology   | 25 th  percentile   | 50 th  percentile   | 75 th  percentile   |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| FY 2022   | A             | 119:1               | 88:1                | 71:1                |\n| FY 2021*  | A             | 103:1               | 81:1                | 67:1                |\n| FY 2020   | A             | 48:1                | 37:1                | 31:1                |\n| FY 2019   | A             | 57:1                | 44:1                | 37:1                |\n| FY 2018** | C             | 85:1                | 67:1                | 57:1                |",

It is therefore expected that the ratios will fluctuate significantly year-on-year to reflect Croda's performance. In respect of the 2022 figures, as this has been an outstanding year for performance both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP have paid out at maximum levels. As the PSP has paid out at a slightly higher level, from 97.4% in 2021 to 100% in 2022 the ratio has increased slightly.\n\n## Employee total remuneration\n\n|                   | Actual base  salary 2022   | Total  remuneration  2022   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 75 th  percentile | \u00a351,915                    | \u00a357,178                     |\n| 50 th  percentile | \u00a339,026                    | \u00a346,169                     |\n| 25 th  percentile | \u00a330,880                    | \u00a334,287                     |\n\nWe believe that our CEO pay ratio is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies. The sharing of success has been a strong theme in 2022 and although the CEO pay ratios have widened, employees have also benefitted from a strong performing year. The 'Free Share Plan' launched in 2021 will pay out for 2022, rewarding our most junior employees proportionally the most. The annual bonus plans will pay out globally also.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n## Key focus areas\n\nDetailed responsibilities are set out in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found at croda.com/en-gb/investors/governance/board committees/remuneration-committee.\n\nA summary is provided below:\n\n- \u00b7  Determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Company's Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of senior management\n- \u00b7  In determining such policy, take into account factors which it deems necessary, including relevant legal and regulatory requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and associated guidance\n- \u00b7  Review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture, taking these into account when setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors\n- \u00b7  Feedback to the Board on workforce reward, incentives and conditions in support of the Board's monitoring of whether the workforce policies and practices of the Company are aligned with its Purpose, values and strategy\n- \u00b7  Review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy\n- \u00b7  Establish the selection criteria, select, appoint and set the terms of reference for any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee and obtain reliable, up-to-date information about remuneration in other companies\n- \u00b7  Oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n- \u00b7  Review of latest market and governance developments\n- \u00b7  Discuss the Remuneration Policy for 2023 - 2026 and any proposed changes\n- \u00b7  Review shareholder consultation feedback on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy\n- \u00b7  Agree the proposed changes to Remuneration Policy\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for 2021 and approach for 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  Remuneration outcomes for 2021, including vesting of 2019 PSP awards\n- \u00b7  Establishing the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP targets for 2022\n- \u00b7  Granting of 2022 PSP awards and Restricted Share Plan awards\n\n## Wider workforce:\n\n- \u00b7  Granting of the Free Share Plan\n- \u00b7  Annual review of wider workforce remuneration\n\n## Remuneration approach for 2023:\n\n- \u00b7  Approval of salary increase for the CEO and Group Finance Director effective 1 January 2023\n- \u00b7  Approval of Chair fee increase effective 1 January 2023\n- \u00b7  Agreeing terms for the new CFO\n\n## 7.

EVA in the final year exceeded EVA in the year prior to the start of the performance period and therefore no adjustment to the awards is required as a result of EVA performance.\n\nThe Committee used the Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that performance was robust and sustainable. The Committee therefore determined that 100% of the senior annual Bonus Plan was payable.\n\nOne third of the bonus payable will be deferred into shares for three years.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\nCroda has a number of different pension plans in the countries in which we operate. Pension entitlements for Executive Directors are tailored to local market practice, length of service and the participant's age. In 2016, a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) scheme was introduced with a cap applied to pension benefits; at this time the cap was set at \u00a365,000. The cap is increased each year in line with inflation, and from April 2023 will be \u00a376,614. Employees who earn in excess of the pension cap or who cannot be members of the plan due to tax limitations receive a pension supplement. For Executive Directors this supplement is up to 20% of salary in line with the wider UK workforce.\n\n## Steve Foots' historic pension provision\n\nSteve Foots was a member of the Croda Pension Scheme up to 31 January 2021. Steve Foots accrued pension benefits under the Croda Pension Scheme up to this date with a CARE accrual rate of 1/60 th and an entitlement to retire at age 60. From 6 April 2011 onwards, pension benefits accruing were based on a capped salary. This cap was \u00a3187,500 until April 2014 at which point it reduced to \u00a3150,000, and due to annual allowance regulations and changes to the pension scheme, reduced to \u00a337,500 in April 2016 (reduced from the scheme cap of \u00a365,650 due to annual allowance regulations) and reduced again in April 2020 to \u00a315,000 following new annual allowance regulations. If Steve Foots retires before the age of 60, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, unless he is retiring at the Company's request. In the event of death, a pension equal to two thirds of the Director's pension would become payable to the surviving spouse. Steve Foots' pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum for benefits accrued before 6 April 2006, and in line with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued from 6 April 2006 onwards.\n\nSteve Foots is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy. Steve Foots elected to opt out of the Croda Pension Scheme from 31 January 2021 and therefore only now receives a pension supplement of 20% of salary.\n\n## Jez Maiden's pension provision\n\nJez Maiden has elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2022. He is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.\n\n## 3. Payments for cessation of office\n\nThere were no payments for loss of office during the year under review.\n\n## 4. Payments to past Directors\n\nThere were no payments to past Directors during the year under review.\n\n## 5. Transition of Chief Financial Officer\n\nJez Maiden will retire as Group Finance Director of Croda in 2023 and will be succeeded by Louisa Burdett as Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Joining arrangement for Louisa Burdett\n\nLouisa Burdett was appointed on a salary of \u00a3520,000 and will receive a pension supplement of 20% of salary aligned to the UK workforce. In addition she will also receive a travel allowance to facilitate travel to Croda's offices in Yorkshire.\n\nLouisa Burdett will participate in both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP on the same basis as Jez Maiden, which, subject to approval of the new Remuneration Policy will have maximum opportunities of 150% of salary and 200% of salary, respectively, for 2023.\n\nThere was no sign-on bonus or buy-out.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements for Jez Maiden on his retirement\n\nRemuneration arrangements for Jez Maiden on his retirement were in line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy. He will continue to receive his salary, pension supplement and benefits up until the date of his departure. Jez Maiden was not a member of the Croda Pension Scheme, and so no pension is payable.\n\nFor 2023, Jez Maiden will remain eligible for a bonus under the senior annual Bonus Plan, which will be pro-rated for the period he is employed during the year. This will be paid at the normal time subject to the satisfaction of performance. Jez Maiden will not receive a PSP award in 2023.\n\nIn respect of outstanding share awards, these will subsist. For awards granted under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and vested PSP awards that remain subject to a holding period, these will continue and will be released at the normal time. Outstanding PSP awards will vest in line with their original vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction of the original performance conditions, and the two-year holding period will continue to apply. Outstanding PSP awards will be pro-rated to reflect the period during which Jez Maiden was employed by the Group.\n\nOutstanding shares and options under the SIP and UK Sharesave Scheme will be treated in accordance with the appliable plan rules.\n\nIn line with the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy, Jez Maiden will be required to retain a shareholding for two years post-employment. The post-employment shareholding requirement applies in respect of up to 100% of his in-employment guidelines for the first year post-employment, applicable in respect of all shares vested from 2020, tapering down to 0% over the second year. The Company will operate mechanisms to enforce the requirement.\n\nThere will be no payments for loss of office.",

The policy applies to shares from awards that vest from 2020. From adoption of the new 2023 policy, the post-employment shareholding requirements will be set at 100% of the in-employment guideline to be retained for the entire two year period following leaving. Jez Maiden's post-employment shareholding requirement will follow the current policy of 100% of the in-employment guideline for the first year after leaving employment, tapering to 0% by the end of year two. The Committee is implementing structures to ensure that post-employment shareholding requirements are adhered to, via our third-party share plan administrator.\n\n## 7.

        "page_content": "## Directors' report\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nPages 70 to 144 inclusive, together with the sections of the Annual Report and Accounts incorporated by reference, constitute a Directors' Report that has been drawn up and presented in accordance with applicable English company law; the liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report are subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by that law.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development activities are undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Directors are recommending a final dividend of 61.0p per share (2021: 56.5p). If approved by shareholders, total dividends for the year will amount to 108.0p per share (2021: 100.0p). Details of dividends are shown in note 8 on page 177; details of the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan can be found on page 211. The Company has established various Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) in connection with the obligation to satisfy future share awards under employee share incentive schemes. The trustees of the EBTs have waived their rights to receive dividends on certain Ordinary Shares of the Company held in the EBTs. Such waivers represent less than 1% of the total dividend payable on the Company's Ordinary Shares. Further details of the EBTs can be found in note 24 on page 200.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association (Articles) give the Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. The present Directors of the Company are shown on pages 72 and 73.\n\nIn line with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, each Director will be standing for election or re-election at the AGM, with the exception of Jez Maiden and Helena Ganczakowski who will retire at the AGM. Details of the Directors' service contracts are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 119.\n\nApart from the share option schemes, long-term incentive schemes and service contracts, no Director had any beneficial interest in any contract to which the Company or a subsidiary was a party during the year. A statement indicating the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company, including share options, is shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 135.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for managing the business of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, the Company's Articles and any directions given by special resolution.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Company maintains Directors' and Officers' liability insurance that gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against its Directors. The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company Secretary, which represent 'qualifying third party indemnity provisions' (as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006), in relation to certain losses and liabilities that the Directors or Company Secretary may incur to third parties in the course of acting as Directors or the Company Secretary or as employees of the Company or of any associated company. In addition, such indemnities have been granted to other officers of the Company who are Directors of subsidiary companies within the Group. Such indemnities were in place during 2022 and at the date of approval of the Group financial statements.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAt the date of this report, 142,536,884 Ordinary Shares of 10.609756p each have been issued and are fully paid up and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. At the date of this Report, the Company has issued and fully paid up 21,900 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares, 498,434 6.6% Cumulative Preference Shares and 615,562 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares, all of \u00a31 each (the Preference Shares). The rights and obligations attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles are available on the Company's website www.croda.com or copies can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares or on the transfer of securities in the Company. The 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than 12 calendar months in arrears. The 6.6% and 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company, unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than six calendar months in arrears or the business of the general meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for reducing the share capital of the Company, to sell the undertaking of the Company or to alter the Articles. No person holds securities in the Company that carry special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.\n\n## Power to issue or buy back shares\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued shares in the Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to approximately one third of the issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, for general purposes, plus up to a further one third of the Company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, but only in the case of a rights issue.",

Both of these authorities expire on the date of the 2023 AGM, that is 26 April 2023, and so the Directors propose to renew them for a further year.\n\n## Substantial shareholdings\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 in accordance with DTR 5 the holders of notifiable interests in the Company's share capital are shown in the table below.\n\n|                         | Number of  shares   | % of issued  capital   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc.         | 8,534,795           | 6.62%                  |\n| Massachusetts Financial |                     |                        |\n| Services Company        | 6,970,021           | 4.99%                  |\n| Norges Bank             | 5,597,132           | 4.01%                  |\n| Royal Bank of Canada    | 5,093,443           | 3.65%                  |\n\n## Employees\n\nDiversity: We are committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment and to ensuring that no applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of any protected characteristic or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements that cannot be shown to be justified. Group human resources policies are clearly communicated to all of our employees and are available through the Company intranet.\n\nRecruitment and progression: It is established policy throughout the business that decisions on recruitment, career development, promotion and other employment related issues are made solely on the grounds of individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct.\n\nWe give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from people with disabilities, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Should an employee become disabled during their employment with the Company, they are fully supported by our Occupational Health provision. Efforts are made to continue their employment with reasonable adjustments being made to the workplace and role where feasible. Retraining is provided if necessary.\n\nDevelopment and learning: The Company recognises that the key to future success lies in the skills and abilities of its dedicated global workforce. The continuous development of all of our employees is key to meeting the future demands of our customers, especially in relation to enhanced creativity, innovation and customer service.\n\nInvolvement: We are committed to ensuring that employees share in the success of the Group. Owning shares in the Company is an important way of strengthening involvement in the development of the business and bringing together employees' and shareholders' interests. In 2022, 84% of our UK employees and 60% of our non-UK employees participated in one of our all-employee share plans, indicating employees' continued desire to be involved in the Company.\n\nEmployees are kept informed of matters of interest to them in a variety of ways, including the Company magazine, Croda Way; quarterly updates; the Company intranet, Connect; team briefings, podcasts, webinars, Yammer and Croda Now email messages. These communications help achieve a common awareness of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of Croda and of changes within the business. We are committed to providing employees with opportunities to share their views and provide feedback on issues that are important to them. The Directors maintain oversight of employee matters through the Board and Committee meeting processes and information flows, including regular updates on employee matters and employee feedback received through employee engagement surveys. How the Directors engaged with employees and considered their interests when taking key decisions is further detailed on pages 78 to 81.\n\n## Non-financial reporting directive\n\nThe Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and NonFinancial Reporting) Regulations 2016 (the Regulations) require companies to disclose non-financial information necessary to provide investors and other stakeholders with a better understanding of a company's development, performance, position and impact of its activity. Throughout this Annual Report the Directors have disclosed a mix of financial and non-financial KPIs which they believe best reflect the Group's strategic priorities, and which will help to convey an understanding of the culture of the business and the drivers which contribute to the ongoing success of the Company. Please see the non-financial information statement on page 69 which sets out where stakeholders can find information relating to non-financial matters.\n\n## Mandatory XBRL tagging\n\nThe Board reviewed the process that had been developed to ensure that the primary financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, had been tagged in line with required taxonomy.\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nCertain information that is required to be included in the Directors' Report can be found elsewhere in this document as referred to below, each of which is incorporated by reference into the Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7  Information on greenhouse gas emissions can be found on page 65.\n- \u00b7  Information on energy consumption can be found on page 65.\n- \u00b7  Information on energy efficiency can be found on page 65.\n- \u00b7  Information on gas emissions, energy consumption and energy efficiency - other disclosures can be found on page 65.\n- \u00b7  For the purposes of Listing Rule (LR) 9.8.6R(8) the information on climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendation and the TCFD recommended disclosure can be found on pages 60 to 68.\n- \u00b7  Further details of the actions which the Group is taking to reduce emissions can also be found in the Sustainability Report and at www.croda.com.\n- \u00b7  An indication of likely future developments in the Group's business can be found throughout the Strategic Report, starting on page 1.",

Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\n## Audit committee interaction\n\n## Our independence\n\nOur audit plan for FY22 was impacted by the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses ('PTIC') which affected our risk assessment. We identified the significant judgement in relation to whether the PTIC divestment constituted a discontinued operation as a significant risk of fraud and error. Further, we identified the overall PTIC divestment accounting to be a key audit matter due to the complexities involved, allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement.\n\nThe carrying amounts of both the Fragrances and Flavours CGUs are sensitive to key assumptions. There is an impairment risk due to the current trading performance compared to the original acquisition projections and associated management bias linked to this. Therefore, we identified goodwill valuation, in relation to these CGUs, to be a significant risk of fraud and error.\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                                                                      | Vs  FY21   |   Item |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|\n| Divestment of majority of the  Performance Technologies and  Industrial Chemicals businesses  ('PTIC') | + +        |    4.1 |\n| Fragrances and Flavours  goodwill valuation                                                            |            |    4.2 |\n| Valuation of UK defined benefit  pension scheme liabilities                                            |            |    4.3 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe UK defined benefit scheme is still open to future accrual and new members, and small changes in the assumptions and estimates with respect to the obligation would have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. As part of our risk assessment, we removed the US defined benefit pension scheme from the scope of our assessed significant risk, because the potential range of reasonable outcomes is lower than materiality.\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee met five times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the Audit Committee in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the Audit Committee in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.\n\nThe matters included in the report of the Audit Committee on page 96 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities and remain independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nApart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 31 December 2022 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nDuring 2023, we identified that certain KPMG member firms had provided preparation of local GAAP financial statement services and, in some cases, foreign language translation of those financial statements over the period 2019 to 2022 to entities not in scope for the group audit. The services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work was undertaken after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG LLP for each of the impacted financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on Croda International Plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our professional judgment, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of this service would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Audit Committee concurred with this view.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 5 financial years ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As these are the second sets of the Group's financial statements signed by Ian Griffiths, he will be required to rotate off after the FY25 audit.\n\nThe average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is 3.5 years, with the shortest being 1 and the longest being 5.\n\n| Total audit fee                                               | \u00a32.2m         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Audit related fees   (including interim review)               | \u00a30.2m         |\n| Other services                                                | \u00a30.0m         |\n| Non-audit fee as a %   of total audit and audit related fee % | 1.9%          |\n| Date first appointed                                          | 25 April 2018 |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                                    | 5 years       |\n| Next financial period   which requires a tender               | 2028          |\n| Tenure of Group engagement partner                            | 2 years       |\n| Average tenure   of component signing partners                | 3.5 years     |",

As such, we based our Group materiality on normalised PBT of \u00a3379.7m (FY21: \u00a3328.6m), of which it represents 4.7% (FY21: 4.9%).\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets of which it represents 0.3% (FY21: 0.3%).\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world.\n\nOf the Group's 87 (FY21: 87) reporting components, we subjected 11 (FY21: 10) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 4 (FY21: 6) to specified risk-focused audit procedures as these are not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group's results.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup\n\nGroup Materiality\n\nGPM\n\nGroup Performance Materiality\n\nHCM\n\nHighest Component Materiality\n\nPLC\n\nParent Company Materiality\n\nLCM\n\nLowest Component Materiality\n\nAMPT\n\nAudit Misstatement Posting Threshold\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial statements",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's Independent Auditor's Report continued\n\n## The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements. The Group is monitoring Climate Positive targets and Science Based targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00baC by 2030, and to be climate net zero by 2050. During the year, the Group rebaselined its metrics to reflect the impact of the PTIC divestment and decided not to alter its 2030 targets and developed externally validated decarbonisation plans for its manufacturing sites and major office locations. Climate change initiatives impact the Group in a variety of ways including opportunities and risks relating to bio-based raw material supply, operational and supply chain decarbonisation and emerging regulatory requirements such as carbon taxes. Further information is provided on pages 60 to 68.\n\nThe Group considered the impact of climate change and the Group's targets in the preparation of the financial statements, including an evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements. The Group concluded that this did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, as described on page 164 and 165. As part of our audit, we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risks on the Group's financial statements, including their assessment of critical accounting estimates and judgements, and the effect on our audit. We have performed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact, including the goodwill impairment assessment, the estimates made regarding useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, and the valuation of certain unquoted pension assets. We held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. Taking into account the nature of the industry in which the Fragrances and the Flavours CGUs operates, the expected remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and the nature of unquoted pension assets, we assessed that there is not a significant impact on our audit for this financial year.\n\nThere was no significant impact of climate on our key audit matters. We have read the Group's disclosure on TCFD in the front half of the annual report as set out on pages 60 to 68 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period were:\n\n- -The impact on the Group's cashflows from the agreement to acquire Solus Biotech on a debt-free, cash-free basis.\n- -Non completion of the Solus Biotech transaction within agreed timelines which could trigger a partial repayment of the USPP bonds.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as regulatory incidents, site incidents and impact of product quality issues leading to a product recall or loss of revenue which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Group's current and projected cash and facilities (a reverse stress test). We also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure on page 164.\n\nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the Directors' use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- -We consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- -We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- -We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement on page 164 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 164 to be acceptable; and\n- -The same statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Key audit matters\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- -the overall audit strategy;\n- -the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- -directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

If the disposed of business met that definition then the results of that business, and the gain result on disposal, would be presented separately from the results of continuing operations for the current and comparative period.\n\nThe result of continuing operations is a management performance metric and reflects the manner in which results of the Group are interpreted. This gives rise to a significant judgement in the income statement presentation of the results related to PTIC that is susceptible to error and fraud.\n\n## Calculation error\n\nThe divestment of the majority of the PTIC business is a material transaction outside of the normal course of business and affected a number of components across several geographical jurisdictions. The appropriate identification of the component assets and liabilities, and the allocation of the proceeds across these components is an area of higher complexity relative to other areas of the audit and requires additional auditor effort. Controls over such an unusual transaction are not routinely in place which also led to a higher degree of substantive work.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- -Our approach to the audit of the divestment of the majority of PTIC, including the involvement of our taxation and valuation specialists.\n- -Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the divestment being accounted for within continuing operations, rather than as a discontinued operation.\n- -The adequacy of the disclosures relating to this critical accounting judgement.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the area of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- -Whether PTIC was a separate major line of business and a component of the group when assessed against the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and the procedures that we performed, we found the gain on disposal relating to PTIC and the related disclosures to be acceptable and in accordance with accounting standards.\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 101 for details on how the Audit Committee considered this key audit matter as an area of significant attention, page 164 for the accounting policy and Note 28 of the financial statements for disclosures.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- -Accounting analysis: critically assessed the conclusions reached by management in respect of the assessment as to whether the business met the definition of a separate major line of business and a component of the entity relative to the requirements of the relevant accounting standards for the Group.\n- -Tests of details: assessed the accuracy of the calculation of the Group and Parent Company gain on disposal. Compared the divested assets and liabilities to the approved completion accounts.\n- -Our taxation and valuation expertise: involvement of our own valuation and taxation specialists in evaluating the allocation of proceeds and the appropriateness of the resulting taxation charge arising on the gain on disposal for the Group and Parent Company.\n- -Assessing transparency: considered adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the discontinued operations judgement made.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.",

The financial statements (note 12) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- -Our approach to the audit of the Fragrances and Flavours goodwill valuation, including our planned substantive procedures, the involvement of our valuation specialists and the extent of our control reliance.\n- -Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodology and key assumptions used.\n- -The adequacy of the disclosures, particularly as they relate to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the area of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- -The appropriateness of the model, and in particular key assumptions used in the model including EBITDA combined annual growth rate, discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Fragrances and Flavours goodwill valuation and related disclosures to be acceptable (FY21: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 101 for details on how the Audit Committee considered this key audit matter as an area of significant attention, page 166 for the accounting policy and Note 12 of the financial statements for disclosures.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- -Assessing methodology: we obtained the discounted value in use cash flow models and assessed the methodology, principles and integrity of the models.\n- -Our valuation expertise: we involved our own valuation specialists to assist us in challenging the appropriateness of the discount rate assumption.\n- -Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the Group's forecast assumptions for cash flow projections, including the rate of sales growth and operating profit growth in the short to medium term, the long-term growth rates and the appropriateness of discount rates, with reference to internally and externally derived sources.\n- -Historical comparisons: we assessed the Group's historical forecasting accuracy by comparing forecasts from prior years with actual results in those years.\n- -Sensitivity analysis: we performed breakeven analysis on the key assumptions including the discount rate and long-term growth rates.\n- -Assessing transparency: we considered the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of impairment testing and whether disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions properly reflect the risks inherent in the valuations of goodwill.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\nFinancial statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

The UK scheme is also still open to future accrual and new members, and small changes in the assumptions and estimates with respect to the obligation would have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group engages external actuarial specialists to assist them in selecting appropriate assumptions and calculate the obligations.\n- -The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of the defined benefit obligations has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 11) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- -Our approach to the audit of UK defined benefit pension scheme obligations, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists.\n- -Our conclusions on the appropriateness of key assumptions used.\n- -The adequacy of the disclosures, particularly as it relates to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the area of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- -The appropriateness of the valuation of UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities and in particular, the selection of key assumptions used in the valuation (the discount rate, the inflation rate and the mortality rate).\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and the procedures performed, we found the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme obligation to be acceptable (FY21 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 101 for details on how the Audit Committee considered this key audit matter as an area of significant attention, page 168 for the accounting policy and Note 11 of the financial statements for disclosures.\n\nWe continue to perform procedures over recoverability of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors. However, as the relative importance of this matter has reduced in the current period due to the disposal of the PTIC businesses, we have not assessed this as one of the matters of most significance to our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- -Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged key assumptions applied (discount rate, inflation rate, and mortality rate) with the support of our own actuarial specialists, including a comparison of key assumptions against market data.\n- -Actuary's credentials: we assessed the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the Group's actuarial expert.\n- -Sensitivity analysis: we assessed the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in key assumptions.\n- -Assessing transparency: we considered adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the gross obligation to changes in key assumptions.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.",

This included communication from the Group audit team to all full scope and  specified risk-focused component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a  request for these component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and  regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Direct laws context and  link to audit                                                                                                  | The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. The Group is subject  to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including  related companies' legislation), distributable profits legislation, pensions legislation, and taxation legislation, and we  assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial  statement items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Most significant indirect  law/regulation areas                                                                                         | The Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a  material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or  litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have  such an effect: GDPR compliance, health and safety and product liability, competition, anti-bribery and corruption,  intellectual property, employment law, tax, trade compliance laws and environmental legislation, recognising the  nature of the Group's activities.                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                                                                                                         | Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to  enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.  Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an  audit will not detect that breach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Context of the ability of  the audit to detect fraud  or breaches of law or  regulation                                                 | Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some  material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in  accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is  from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures  required by auditing standards would identify it.   In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## \u00a318m\n\n## (FY21: \u00a316m) Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole\n\n## \u00a313.5m\n\n## (FY21: \u00a312m) Performance materiality\n\n## \u00a30.9m\n\n(FY21: \u00a30.8m)\n\nAudit misstatement\n\nposting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a318m (FY21: \u00a316m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of the normalised Group profit before tax from continuing operations ('PBT').\n\nConsistent with FY21, we determined that Group materiality benchmark applied remains the main benchmark for the Group. We normalised by adding back adjustments that do not represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group and by averaging over 3 (FY21: 3) years. The items we adjusted for were exceptional PTIC gain, goodwill impairment and property, plant and equipment impairment (FY21 items we adjusted were exceptional curtailment gains) as disclosed in note 3. We selected 3 (FY21: 3) years to average PBT to account for the fluctuations in the Group's performance due to the impact of COVID19. As such, we based our Group materiality on Group normalised PBT of \u00a3379.7m (FY21: \u00a3328.6m).\n\nOur Group materiality of \u00a318m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBT. When using a benchmark of PBT to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.7% (FY21: 4.9%) to the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a38.7m (FY21: \u00a38.7m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (FY21: 0.3%).\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nThe Parent Company performance materiality was set at \u00a36.5m (FY21: \u00a36.5m), which equates to 75% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the number and level of identified misstatements and control deficiencies during the prior period.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.\n\nThis is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Croda International Plc's Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied\n\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY21: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u00a318m (FY21: \u00a316m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:\n\n|                                    | Total Group Revenue   | Total Group Revenue   | Group Profit Before Tax   | Group Profit Before Tax   | Total Group Assets   | Total Group Assets   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                    | FY22                  | FY21                  | FY22                      | FY21                      | FY22                 | FY21                 |\n| Financial statement Caption        | \u00a3 \u00a322,,008899..33mm   | \u00a31,889.6m             | \u00a3\u00a3778800..00mm            | \u00a3411.5m                   | \u00a3 \u00a333,,661111..99mm  | \u00a33,293.4m            |\n| Group Materiality as % of  caption | 0 0..99%%             | 0.8%                  | 22..33%%                  | 3.9%                      | 0 0..55%%            | 0.5%                 |",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\n## Group audit team oversight\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group has 87 (FY21: 87) reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (FY21: 5%) of total assets or 10% (FY21: 10%) of total revenue or 10% (FY21: 10%) of the Group profit before tax. We selected total assets, total revenue, and profit before tax because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 5 (FY21: 6) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results, with the prior year comparatives indicated in brackets:\n\n| Scope                      | Number of components   | Range of materiality applied   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Full scope audit           | 11 (10)                | \u00a31.8m - \u00a39.9m (\u00a30.9m - \u00a39m)    |\n| Specified audit procedures | 4 (6)                  | \u00a31.8m - \u00a32.7m (\u00a30.9m - \u00a31.5m)  |\n\nThe remaining 22% (FY21: 22%) of total Group revenue, 18% (FY21: 16%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax and 8% (FY21: 12%) of total Group assets is represented by 72 (FY21: 71) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 2% (FY21: 2%) of any of total Group revenue, total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe work on 11 of the 15 components (FY21: 12 of the 16 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team.\n\nThe Group team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- -Understanding of IT is gained centrally on behalf of components that are on the centralised ERP system and findings are shared with relevant component teams.\n- -The Group team adopted a centralised approach to testing revenue, purchases, and journal entries. Data and analytics routines were performed for 13 components, and the Group team assessed the outputs of these routines before sending outputs to component auditors and instructing them to test transactions meeting certain criteria.\n- -The Group team has centrally inspected the PTIC sale and purchase agreement, involved valuation specialists and performed audit procedures on the gain on transaction.\n\nThe Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nIn working with component auditors, we:\n\n- -Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components, including the key audit matter in respect of divestment of the majority of the PTIC businesses.\n- -Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, including specifying the minimum procedures to perform in their audit of revenue, cash and journals.\n- -Visited two (FY21: none) components in-person in Spain and the US as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit approach. Organised regular video conferences with the partners and directors of the Group and component audit teams. At these visits and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component audit teams.\n- -Inspection of component audit teams' key work papers (in person and/or using remote technology capabilities) to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of the components with particular focus on work related to significant risk and assessed the appropriateness of conclusion and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation.

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable law and UKadopted international accounting standards. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a31,122m of committed debt facilities available from its banking group, USPP bondholders and lease providers, with principal maturities between 2023 and 2030, of which \u00a3579.3m (2021: \u00a3334.4m) was undrawn, together with cash balances of \u00a3320.6m (2021: \u00a3112.8m).\n\nThe Directors have reviewed the liquidity and covenant forecasts for the Group's going concern assessment period covering at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Based on these forecasts, the Group continues to have significant liquidity headroom and strong financial covenant headroom under its debt facilities.\n\nA reverse stress testing scenario has been performed which assesses that adjusted operating profit would need to fall by over 90% to trigger an event of default as at 30 June 2024, before considering additional unmodelled actions to conserve cash. The Directors do not consider this a plausible scenario. The Directors have also considered the impact on the Group from the agreement to acquire Solus Biotech for total consideration of approximately \u00a3232m. This acquisition will be funded by the reinvestment of PTIC disposal proceeds and will have no material impact on Croda's leverage and a limited impact on its liquidity. The Directors have also considered the unlikely scenario that if the full reinvestment of PTIC disposal proceeds was not made within the agreed timelines with the USPP bondholders, certain future financial covenant restrictions could trigger a partial repayment of the USPP bonds. In this event any potential repayment could be funded from cash balances and other existing debt facilities. The Directors are therefore satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Group has long recognised the scale of the climate emergency and considers this to offer both opportunities and risks in the future. The Group's current climate change strategy focuses on reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of bio-based raw materials, whilst the benefits in using its ingredients will enable more carbon to be saved than were emitted through operations and supply chain.\n\nThe impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of these financial statements across a number of areas, including; our review of property, plant and equipment remaining useful lives and our evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements which are detailed below, consistent with the risks and opportunities set out on pages 66 to 68. None of these risks had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group will continue developing its assessment of the impact that climate change has on the assets and liabilities recognised and presented in its financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group's significant accounting policies under UK-adopted international accounting standards have been set by management with the approval of the Audit Committee. The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to be made on the applicability of policies to particular situations. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Under UK-adopted international accounting standards an estimate or judgement may be considered critical if it involves matters that are highly uncertain or where different estimation methods could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the Group's results are likely to occur from period to period.\n\nThe critical accounting judgement required when preparing the Group's accounts is as follows:\n\n- (i) Business disposal - The Group completed the divestment of the majority of its Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals ('PTIC') business to a wholly owned subsidiary of Cargill Inc. on 30 June 2022. The Group's assessment that the disposal group does not meet the definition of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, and therefore is not a discontinued operation, is a key judgement. The key considerations in forming this conclusion were:\n- \u00b7 The Group is not exiting a geographical area of operations; Croda will remain active in all territories in which the divested business operates.\n- \u00b7 Whilst the majority of the PTIC business is being divested, a significant proportion remains with Croda via the retained Industrial Specialties product portfolio, supply agreements and retained production capabilities.\n- \u00b7 The complex carve-out requirements of the disposal mean that the operations and cash flows of the divested business cannot be distinguished clearly from the remaining Croda Group.\n\nCroda Sipo in which Croda has a 65% shareholding was excluded from the transaction that completed on 30 June 2022. The Group's assessment that Sipo is not available for sale in its present condition is a key judgement in determining that Sipo is not classified as an asset held for sale at 31 December 2022. The sale of Sipo to Cargill Inc. is subject to reaching agreement with our partner to also sell its stake, which now appears unlikely to occur in the near term.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and assumptions required when preparing the Group's accounts are as follows:\n\n- (i) Post-retirement benefits - as disclosed in note 11, the Group's principal retirement benefit schemes are of the defined benefit type. Year end recognition of the liabilities under these schemes and the valuation of assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant assumptions to be made, relating to key financial market indicators such as inflation and expectations on future salary growth and asset returns. These assumptions are made by the Group in conjunction with the schemes' actuaries and the Directors are of the view that any estimation should be appropriate and in line with consensus opinion. The critical accounting estimate specifically relates to the Group's UK scheme, given the size of the liabilities and their sensitivity to underlying assumptions. Small changes in these assumptions could result in a material adjustment to carrying values in the next financial year.\n- (ii) Goodwill impairment - Management are required to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite lived assets such as goodwill. Accordingly, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment by comparing the carrying value of the underlying Cash Generating Units ('CGUs') to their recoverable amount calculated by detailed value in use calculations. These value in use calculations require the use of estimates to enable the calculation of the net present value of cash flow projections of the relevant CGU. The critical assumptions are as follows:\n- \u00b7 Terminal value growth in EBITDA (calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) - set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term average growth rate, estimated at 3%.\n- \u00b7 Selection of appropriate market participant real post-tax discount rates to reflect the specific nature of the CGU.\n- \u00b7 Specific risk adjusted, real term cash flow projections including key assumptions on revenue growth and operating margins generally over a five-year period unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a longer period.\n\nAn impairment of \u00a334.6m was recorded in relation to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Iberchem's Flavours business. The assumptions selected and associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 12.\n\nExcluding the Flavours CGU, recoverable amounts currently exceed carrying values including goodwill; however, testing did identify that reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Fragrances CGU to be less than the carrying value. The assumptions selected and associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 12.\n\nDue to the nature of the Fragrances and Flavours businesses, including their low carbon footprint, the key assumptions were not materially impacted by the climate change risks and opportunities set out in the Annual Report on pages 66 to 68. The Group's other annual impairment tests were not considered to be materially impacted by the climate change risks and opportunities.\n\nGiven the size of the goodwill balances for the Fragrances and Flavours CGUs and the carrying values' sensitivity to underlying assumptions, small changes in these assumptions could result in a material adjustment to carrying values in the next financial year.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n- (i) The Group adopted the following new accounting policies on 1 January 2022 to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting pronouncements, none of which had a material impact on the Group's financial reporting on adoption, are:\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020;\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use';\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts- Cost of Fulfilling a Contract'; and\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2'.\n- (ii) The IASB has issued the following pronouncements for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 or 1 January 2024:\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 'Reference to the Conceptual Framework';\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' and Amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts';\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current';\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies';\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Non-current Liabilities with Covenants';\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 8 'Definition of Accounting Estimates'; and\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback'; and\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction'.\n\nThe Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and the Group's financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these standards from 1 January 2023 or 1 January 2024 as applicable.",

The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nIntra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.\n\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nThe Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with the equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.\n\n## Intangible assets Goodwill\n\nOn acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as CGUs. Goodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. For goodwill balances where the relevant group of CGUs exceeds the size of the Group's operating segments, impairment testing is performed at the operating segment level.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised immediately against the goodwill value. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is measured on a market-based approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. Value in use is estimated with reference to estimated risk adjusted future post-tax cash flows in real terms discounted to net present value using a market participant real post-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and size risk premium specific to the CGU. Post-tax calculations, rather than pre-tax, are used as they are considered more accurate. For disclosure purposes, pre-tax discount rates are then back-solved using the equivalent pre-tax cash flows, and therefore there is no material difference between the calculations on a pre-tax or post-tax basis. Where required, specific risks associated with the CGU are adjusted through changes to the future cash flow projections. The Group uses growth estimates that track below the Group's historical growth rates unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a different treatment.\n\n## Other intangible assets arising on acquisition\n\nOn acquisition, intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they can be identified through being separable from the acquired entity or arising from specific contractual or legal rights.\n\nOnce recognised, such intangible assets will be initially valued using an appropriate methodology. There were no acquisitions in 2022. For acquisitions in 2021 the following intangible asset types recognised and valuation methodologies applied were:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology processes (relief-from-royalty and replacement cost)\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships (income approach)\n- \u00b7 Trade names and brands (relief-from-royalty)\n\nFollowing initial recognition, the asset will be written down on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which range from 7 to 15 years for technology processes and from 6 to 20 years for trade names, brands and customer relationships. Useful lives are regularly reviewed to ensure their continuing relevance.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific, technical or commercial knowledge and understanding, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred. Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are applied to a plan for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'. Development uncertainties typically mean that such criteria are not met, most commonly because the Group can only demonstrate the existence of a market at a late stage in the product development cycle, at which point the material element of project spend has already been incurred and charged to the income statement. This includes, for example, substantiating potential product claims for use by our customers. Until the desired outcome of such work can be proven, at an economic production cost, the market for a product cannot be said to exist. Furthermore, the Group does not have the ability to reliably measure the development expenditure attributable to all projects during development.\n\nWhere, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch.\n\nIntangible assets relating to products in development are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment. Any impairment losses are written off to the income statement.\n\n## Computer software\n\nCloud computing arrangements are assessed and classified as either service contracts or intangible assets. Computer software licences that meet the definition of an intangible asset, covering a period of greater than a year, are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 7 years.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes intra-Group sales. The Group recognises revenue on completion of contractual performance obligations, generally when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nThe principal activity from which the Group generates revenue is the supply of products to customers from its various manufacturing sites and warehouses, and in some limited instances from consignment inventory held on customer sites. Products are supplied under a variety of standard terms and conditions, and in each case, revenue is recognised when contractual performance obligations between the Group and the customer are satisfied. This will typically be on dispatch or delivery. When sales discount and rebate arrangements result in net variable consideration, appropriate provisions are recognised as a deduction from revenue at the point of sale. The Group typically uses the expected value method for estimating rebates, reflecting that such contracts have similar characteristics and a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not be required.\n\n## Interest and dividend income\n\nInterest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Government grants\n\nThe Group recognises government grant income related to assets when the grant becomes receivable and deducts the income from the cost of the associated asset. Government grant income is recognised separately in the Group Statement of Cash Flows.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks or returns that are different from those of other segments. Operating segments presented in the financial statements are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has been identified as the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' (revised). In respect of defined benefit plans (pension plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation), obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans are the net of plan obligations and assets. A scheme surplus is only recognised as an asset in the balance sheet when the Group has the unconditional right to future economic benefits in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. For those schemes where an accounting surplus is currently recognised, the Group expects to recover the value through reduced future contributions. No allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of either the future expenses of running the schemes or for non-service-related death in service benefits which may arise in the future. The operating costs of such plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised as financial income or an expense as appropriate.\n\nService costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined contribution schemes (pension plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity) are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Other post-retirement benefits\n\nSome Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either (i) terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or (ii) providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of cash and equity settled, sharebased incentive schemes. These are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payments', which requires an expense to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The expense is based on the fair value of each instrument which is calculated using the Black Scholes or binomial model as appropriate. Any expense is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting for non-market-based performance criteria.\n\n## Currency translations\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial period. Exchange profits or losses on trading transactions are included in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;\n- (ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and\n- (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders' equity.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. Temporary differences arise on differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax base and primarily relate to the difference between tax allowances on tangible fixed assets and the corresponding depreciation charge, and upon the net pension fund deficit. Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences. No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit such earnings.\n\nSimilarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such differences can be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nAll taxation is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Income statement presentation\n\nAdjusted results are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the columnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. The same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those items that in the Directors' view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. In the current year exceptional items relate to the gain on business disposal, discount unwind and fair value adjustment in respect of contingent consideration, goodwill impairment and property, plant and equipment impairment. Exceptional items in the prior year related to discount unwind and fair value adjustment in respect of contingent consideration, a pension curtailment gain (arising from transfer of the Dutch scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement), acquisition costs and fees incurred in preparation of the disposal of part of the PTIC business. Details can be found in note 3 on pages 173 and 174.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part of a business combination. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. The Group's policy is to write off the difference between the cost of all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\nReviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence, the impact of climate change as well as normal wear and tear, and adjustments are made where appropriate. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 15 to 40 years for land and buildings, and 3 to 25 years for plant and equipment. All individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Group's 'plant and equipment' asset class predominantly relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Group's manufacturing facilities. Consequently, the Group does not seek to analyse out of this class other items such as motor vehicles and office equipment.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired. If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In addition to this, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## Leases\n\nWhen entering into a new contract, the Group assesses whether it is, or contains, a lease. A lease conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date and discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, more typically, the Group's incremental borrowing rate (when the implicit rate cannot be readily determined).\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or changes in the Group's assessment of whether a purchase, extension or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe Group adopts recognition exemptions for short-term (less than 12 months) and low value leases and elects not to separate lease components from any associated fixed non-lease components.\n\nThe Group classifies payments of lease liabilities (principal and interest portions) as part of financing activities. Payments of short-term, low value and variable lease components are classified within operating activities.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments where deemed appropriate to hedge its exposure to interest rates and short-term currency rate fluctuations. The Group's accounting policy is set out below.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument as either: (i) a hedge of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (ii) a hedge of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge).\n\n## (i) Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives, for example interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. The forward elements of the forward exchange contracts are excluded from the designation of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging, which is recognised in equity in a cost of hedging reserve. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the current amount and timing of the respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the time or amount of the hedged transactions.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhen a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Any difference between the proceeds\n\n(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. With the exception of contingent consideration and forward foreign exchange contracts, trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based on the present value of the expected future payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Continent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value and associated discount unwind are recognised in the income statement. Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value on a mark-to-market basis.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount on a first in first out basis. Cost comprises all expenditure, including related production overheads, incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the inventory to its location and condition at the balance sheet date. Net realisable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable variable selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where appropriate. Profits arising on intra-group sales are eliminated in so far as the product remains in Group inventory at the year end.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is recognised based on lifetime expected losses, but principally comprises balances where objective evidence exists that the amount will not be collectible. Such amounts are written down to their estimated recoverable amounts, with the charge being made to operating expenses.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Cash and bank overdrafts are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, there is an intention to settle on a net basis and interest is charged on a net basis.",

Provisions are made immediately where a legal or constructive obligation is identified, can be quantified and it is regarded as more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. The Group does consider the impact of discounting when establishing provisions and provisions are discounted when the impact is material and the timing of cash flows can be estimated with reasonable certainty.\n\n## Share capital\n\n## Investment in own shares\n\n- (i) Employee share ownership trusts - shares acquired by the trustees of the employee share ownership trust (the Trustees), funded by the Company and held for the continuing benefit of the Company are shown as a reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent. Movements in the year arising from additional purchases by the Trustees of shares or the receipt of funds due to the exercise of options by employees are accounted for within reserves and shown as a movement in equity attributable to owners of the parent in the year. Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company's income statement as incurred.\n- (ii) Treasury shares - where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital as treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability when the liability is irrevocable. Accordingly, final dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders and interim dividends are recognised when paid.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are measured at fair value, with movements in the fair value being recognised in the income statement or equity on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of results.

Profit for the year continued\n\nThe exceptional items in the current year reflect the gain on business disposal, discount unwind and fair value adjustment both in respect of contingent consideration, the goodwill impairment of the Group's Flavours Cash Generating Unit (note 12) and an impairment relating to the write-off of unusable manufacturing plant in Japan. Movements in contingent consideration have been presented as exceptional as they are not directly representative of the underlying business performance in the period, and therefore this presentation provides a meaningful basis to make comparisons between reporting periods. The gain on business disposal and impairment charges have been presented as exceptional due to their size and one-off nature. The exceptional items in the prior year related to the discount unwind and fair value adjustment both in respect of contingent consideration, a pension curtailment gain (arising from transfer of the Dutch scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement), acquisition costs and fees incurred in preparation of the disposal of part of the PTIC business.\n\n|                                                                                                             | 2022  \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Services provided by the Group's auditors                                                                   |            |           |\n| Audit services                                                                                              |            |           |\n| Fees payable to the Group auditors for the audit of Parent Company and consolidated financial statements    | 0.3        | 0.2       |\n| Fees payable to the Group auditors and its associates for the audit of the Company's subsidiaries           | 1.9        | 1.4       |\n| Other audit services                                                                                        |            |           |\n| Audit-related assurance and other services including fees payable in relation to the Group's interim review | 0.2        | 0.1       |\n|                                                                                                             | 2.4        | 1.7       |\n\n## 4.

The reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items is 16.2% (2021: 21.6%).\n\nThe reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items includes the tax arising on the gain of the PTIC divestment and associated business disposal costs. Whilst the gain was subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which business units were sold, a number of local exemptions have resulted in the overall gain being taxed at a rate significantly lower than the UK's standard tax rate of 19.0%. This has reduced the reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items in the current year. The impairment of goodwill, also included in exceptional items, is a non-taxdeductible expense and included within expenses and write-offs not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nCroda operates in many tax jurisdictions other than the UK, both as a manufacturer and distributor, with the majority of those jurisdictions having rates higher than the UK, considerably so in some cases. It is the exposure to these different tax rates that increases the effective tax rate above the UK standard rate and also makes it difficult to forecast the Group's future tax rate with any certainty given the unpredictable nature of exchange rates, individual economies and tax legislators. Other than the exposure to higher overseas tax rates, there are no significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported tax charge based on its adjusted accounting profit. Given the global nature of the Group, and the number of associated cross-border transactions between connected parties, we are exposed to potential adjustments to the price charged for those transactions by tax authorities. However, the Group carries appropriate provisions relating to the level of risk.\n\nLegislation to increase the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, effective from 1 April 2023. The UK deferred tax is calculated at 25%. The overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe UK, like many other jurisdictions, will bring into effect its supporting Pillar 2 tax legislation from 31 December 2023. First applicable to the Group's 31 December 2024 period end, this legislation will effectively mandate the incurrence of a minimum effective tax rate of 15% (in aggregate) across each of its trading jurisdictions.\n\nInitial assessments, supported through an appraisal of those preliminary safe harbours communicated by the OECD, validate the Group's view that no material tax exposures are expected to arise under this legislation. Notwithstanding this, the Croda Group continues to proactively monitor developments in this area and has actioned an internal roadmap to ensure the Group is compliant ahead of the first reporting event (currently 30 June 2026).",

Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2023 and beyond has been measured using the rate due to prevail in the year of reversal.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised in all material cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered. At 31 December 2022, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of \u00a339.1m (2021: \u00a332.6m) of losses across the Group as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future. If all earnings were remitted, an additional \u00a315.8m (2021: \u00a39.3m) of tax would be payable.\n\nAll movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in the income statement with the exception of the items shown in note 5(b).\n\nOf the gross deferred tax assets, \u00a36.7m are expected to reverse within 12 months of the balance sheet date. No material reversal of any of the deferred tax liability is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date based on the Group's current capital expenditure programme.",

All of the Group's final salary type pension schemes (which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life based on salary in the final years leading up to retirement) are closed to future service accrual with the exception of a small number of 'grandfathered' employees in the US scheme.\n\nThe UK scheme, which remains open to new members, operated on a final salary basis until 5 April 2016, following which the scheme changed to a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) defined benefit scheme, with annual pensionable earnings capped and pensions in payment indexed based on CPI (previously RPI) for service accrued from 6 April 2016. This change reduces the future comparable cost and risk attached to the UK scheme. The US scheme operates a cash balance pension scheme that provides a guaranteed rate of return on pension contributions until retirement (other than for 'grandfathered' employees). From 1 October 2017 the US scheme was closed to new joiners, who will receive defined contribution benefits. The US plans also do not generally receive inflationary increases once in payment. With the exception of this difference in inflationary risk, the Group's main defined benefit pension schemes continue to face materially similar risks, as described on pages 182 and 183.\n\nThe majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.\n\nPlan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, predominantly lies with the particular scheme's board of trustees with appropriate input from the relevant Group company. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each scheme's regulations and any relevant legislation.\n\nDuring the period the business divestment resulted in a curtailment gain of \u00a33.9m on cessation of defined benefit accrual, primarily within the Group's UK pension scheme, which has been recognised in the Group income statement as part of the gain on business disposal. During 2021 the Group's primary Netherlands scheme was converted into a collective defined contribution scheme for both past and future service. This change resulted in a curtailment gain of \u00a311.2m on the cessation of defined benefit accrual, which was recognised in the Group income statement as an exceptional item.",

Where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. The UK mortality improvement scale has been updated to CMI2021, in order to reflect the most recent CMI model with no weighting for 2020 and 2021 experience given uncertainty around the long-term impact of COVID-19 on life expectancy. The mortality experience analysis for the scheme will be carried out in the future as part of the 30 September 2023 funding valuation for the UK Croda Pension Scheme. Applying the mortality tables adopted, the expected future average lifetime of members currently at age 65 and members at age 65 in 20 years' time is as follows:\n\n|        | Current age 65   | Current age 65   | Age 65 in  20 years   | Age 65 in  20 years   |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|        | UK               | US               | UK                    | US                    |\n| Male   | 20.2             | 20.9             | 21.5                  | 22.1                  |\n| Female | 23.3             | 22.8             | 24.8                  | 23.9                  |\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the significant assumptions is as follows:\n\n|                                                          | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Sensitivity                               | Of increase                               | Of decrease                               |\n| Discount rate                                            | 0.5%                                      | -6.3%                                     | 7.0%                                      |\n| Inflation rate                                           | 0.5%                                      | 4.7%                                      | -4.5%                                     |\n| Mortality (assumes a one-year change in life expectancy) | 1 year                                    | 3.6%                                      | -3.6%                                     |\n\nThe above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 14.3 years (2021: 18.1 years).\n\nThe assets in the schemes comprised:\n\n|                                          | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2022  %   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2021 %   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Quoted                                   |           |           |           |          |\n| Equities                                 | 70.1      | 7%        | 188.2     | 14%      |\n| Government bonds                         | 336.9     | 36%       | 590.8     | 44%      |\n| Corporate bonds                          | 56.3      | 6%        | 70.6      | 5%       |\n| Other quoted securities                  | 24.2      | 2%        | 28.7      | 2%       |\n| Unquoted                                 |           |           |           |          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                | 98.1      | 10%       | 73.1      | 5%       |\n| Real estate (pooled investment vehicles) | 60.3      | 6%        | 61.6      | 5%       |\n| Derivatives                              | (46.1)    | -5%       | 10.0      | 1%       |\n| Other                                    | 369.5     | 38%       | 317.1     | 24%      |\n|                                          | 969.3     | 100%      | 1,340.1   | 100%     |\n\nDerivatives presented above represent the scheme's net position on Government bond repurchase agreements and other swap contracts (valued on a mark-to-market basis) which form part of the scheme's Liability Driven Investment (LDI) portfolio. The non-derivative assets in the LDI portfolio have been presented in the relevant asset category. During September and October 2022 significant volatility in UK interest rates impacted pensions scheme's that use LDI funds. The Scheme's low level of leverage in the LDI portfolio and significant collateral headroom has meant that the Scheme has remained resilient to this volatility. As a result of market movements, the Scheme's asset allocation during Q4 2022 was out of line with the target allocation with an overweight position to return seeking assets. The Trustee and investment consultant reviewed the Scheme's investments and instructed various trades to rebalance the Scheme's portfolio towards the target allocation. The increases in interest rates over the year have seen an improvement in the Scheme's overall funding position and the Trustee and its advisors are continuing to review and monitor the situation. Other investments include; a fund of hedge funds, which consists of a fund of multiple investment managers across both traditional markets such as equities and credit and also more specialist diversified strategies; infrastructure type investments that hold assets linked to the value and income from UK and overseas infrastructure.",

The schemes hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term. As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities. However, the Group and the pension trustees (Trustees) believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group's long-term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently. See below for more details on the Group's asset-liability matching strategy.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nSome of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, the level of inflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation. The majority of the schemes' assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit. In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes' liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an assetliability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes. Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous years.\n\nInvestments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A significant portion of assets in 2022 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds. The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long-term with an acceptable level of risk. The UK scheme makes use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.\n\nThe latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme was completed as at 30 September 2020. As a result, no deficit funding payments to this scheme are required prior to completion of the next triennial valuation (as at 30 September 2023). The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually. As at 1 December 2021 the scheme was 150.2% funded.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill\n\nThe Group's goodwill balance predominantly relates to the value of commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses with Croda's established global sales, marketing and R&D networks. This goodwill is allocated to the Group's Cash Generating Units (CGUs) expected to benefit from that combination based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows.\n\nFollowing the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business as announced in the 2022 Interim Statement, the retained business now forms a new Industrial Specialties sector. Accordingly, the Group has combined the previously reported operating business segments for the year ended 31 December 2021 for both Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals and shown as Industrial Specialties. The divestment included the disposal of standalone CGUs Ionphase and Rewitec.\n\nThe Fragrances CGU includes the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Parfex S.A. ('Parfex') in June 2021. This is in line with the level at which goodwill is monitored by Management following the integration of Parfex into the Group.\n\nAs discussed in the accounting policies note on page 166, goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant CGU's recoverable amount compared to the unit's carrying value including goodwill. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections with the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Terminal value growth rates - set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term average growth rate, estimated at 3%.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - set using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow projections - based on management's most recent risk-adjusted view of future trading, with assumptions including revenue growth, operating margins, maintenance capital expenditure and working capital days.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to operating business segments as follows:\n\n|                        | 2022 Restated 2021   | 2022 Restated 2021     | 2022 Restated 2021   | 2022 Restated 2021   | 2022 Restated 2021      | 2022 Restated 2021   |\n|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n|                        | Standalone CGUs \u00a3m   | Allocated  goodwill \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m             | Standalone  CGUs  \u00a3m | Allocated  goodwill  \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m             |\n| Consumer Care          | 370.3                | 219.2                  | 589.5                | 385.4                | 213.7                   | 599.1                |\n| Life Sciences          | 163.3                | 69.2                   | 232.5                | 151.2                | 69.5                    | 220.7                |\n| Industrial Specialties | 22.6                 | -                      | 22.6                 | 30.9                 | 1.3                     | 32.2                 |\n|                        | 556.2                | 288.4                  | 844.6                | 567.5                | 284.5                   | 852.0                |\n\nThe allocated goodwill primarily relates to \u00a363m (2021: \u00a359m) associated with the 2020 acquisition of Iberchem as it relates to revenue synergies with Croda's existing Consumer Care business and \u00a3192m (2021: \u00a3192m) associated with the 2006 acquisition of Uniqema (with all other balances individually less than \u00a310m). Due to the geographical and operational scale of the Uniqema acquisition, this goodwill balance is tested for impairment at an operating business segment level. Standalone CGUs operate independently of the Group's core regional operating assets, are capable of generating largely independent cash inflows and therefore goodwill relating to standalone CGUS is tested separately for impairment annually.\n\nFor impairment testing performed at an operating business segment level, cash flow projections are based on the Group's current year results and a growth rate of 3% (an appropriate risk-adjusted view based on past experience reflecting the market and territories in which the Group operates), discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 9.9% pre-tax (2021: 8.5%). No reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the operating segments to be less than their carrying value. Based on the testing performed, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## Standalone CGUs\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill (post impairment) is allocated to Standalone CGUs as follows:\n\n|              | 2022  \u00a3m   |   Restated 2021 \u00a3m |\n|--------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Incotec      | 71.2       |               67.6 |\n| Biosector    | 26.0       |               24.6 |\n| Sipo         | 22.6       |               22.1 |\n| Ionphase     | -          |                6.5 |\n| Rewitec      | -          |                2.3 |\n| Avanti       | 66.1       |               59   |\n| Fragrances   | 269.3      |              255.5 |\n| Flavours     | 94.4       |              123.6 |\n| Alban Muller | 6.6        |                6.3 |\n|              | 556.2      |              567.5 |",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFor all Standalone CGUs the recoverable amount was based on value in use calculations, including Sipo, which was based on fair value less cost to sell in the prior year. Cash flow projections have been based on specific risk adjusted estimates for five years taking management's most recent view of medium-term trading prospects. Unless otherwise stated, cash flow projections assume an appropriate view of past experience, specifically considering revenue growth in relation to market share, maintaining operating margins, maintenance capital expenditure and working capital days. Previously Biosector, Fragrances and Flavours cash flow projections were based on 10-year projections that supported the acquisitions, however these have been refreshed in the year based on management's latest view and capped to a 5-year period to reduce the risk with longer term forecasting, consistent with other CGU's cash flow projections. Due to the changes in the cash flow projections, where applicable, comparative growth rates are not presented. Discount rates have been calculated for standalone CGUs considering specific size risk premiums. Excluding Fragrances and Flavours, discount rates have increased in the year as a result of the independent inputs into the calculation, predominantly the increase in risk-free rates. Given the diverse geographical spread of the Fragrances and Flavours business, the risk-free rates has been less impacted by changes in interest rate compared to the Group's other CGUs. The terminal value growth rates and discount rates applied in these CGU level calculations are set out below:\n\n|              | 2022   | Terminal value  growth rate  2021   | 2022   | Pre-tax discount rate 2021   |\n|--------------|--------|-------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------|\n| Incotec      | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 11.0%  | 8.9%                         |\n| Biosector    | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 13.6%  | 11.0%                        |\n| Sipo         | 3.0%   | n/a                                 | 12.4%  | n/a                          |\n| Avanti       | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 12.8%  | 11.0%                        |\n| Fragrances   | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 10.6%  | 10.5%                        |\n| Flavours     | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 10.5%  | 10.4%                        |\n| Alban Muller | 3.0%   | n/a                                 | 12.8%  | n/a                          |\n\nAn impairment of \u00a334.6m was recorded in relation to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Iberchem's Flavours business. This principally reflected the impact of significant cost inflation which was not fully recovered, with future value of the business being behind the acquisition case. The assumptions underpinning the cash flow projection used in the value in use calculation reflect management's most recent five-year business plan. These projections use an appropriate view of past experience, specifically that operating margins will improve in the medium to long-term and sales growth targets will be achieved resulting in approximately 14% compound average growth rates ('CAGR') at a sales level and 20% EBITDA CAGR over the period.\n\nExcluding Flavours, based on the annual impairment testing performed for all standalone CGUs no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2022 and standalone CGUs remain on track to perform to our long-term expectations. In forming this conclusion, the Directors have reviewed sensitivity analysis which considered all reasonably possible downsides on key assumptions, both individually and in combination, and considered whether these would give rise to an impairment. This analysis concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Standalone CGUs to be less than the carrying value, other than for the Fragrances and Flavours CGUs.\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Fragrances CGU exceeded its carrying value by approximately \u00a3111m (2021: \u00a317m) and therefore the Directors concluded that no impairment was required; however, the calculations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions. The key assumptions considered by the Directors, where a reasonably possible change could give rise to an impairment, were the EBITDA CAGR (set at approximately 16%), pre-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate. Sensitivity disclosures for both the Fragrances and Flavours CGUs are set out below.\n\n## Sensitivity to changes in assumptions\n\nThe recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom or impairment charge, is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at the cash flow projections, long-term growth rate, and the discount rate. Although it is not management's current expectation, the impact on the recoverable amount when applying a reasonably possible change in these assumptions would be as follows for the year ended 31 December 2022:\n\n|                                                       | Flavours    | Flavours    | Flavours     | Fragrances   | Fragrances   | Fragrances   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                       | Sensitivity | Increase \u00a3m | Decrease  \u00a3m | Sensitivity  | Increase \u00a3m  | Decrease \u00a3m  |\n| Incremental increase/(decrease) in recoverable amount |             |             |              |              |              |              |\n| Change in pre-tax discount rate by:                   | 1.0%        | (21.1)      | 27.7         | 1.0%         | (80.0)       | 104.7        |\n| Change in long-term growth rates by:                  | 1.0%        | 28.5        | (20.0)       | 1.0%         | 109.5        | (76.8)       |\n| Change in EBITDA compound annual growth rate by:      | 5.0%        | 39.8        | (33.9)       | 5.0%         | 167.1        | (141.3)      |\n\nThe above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, some of the assumptions may be correlated.",

Interest is charged on this agreement at a floating rate based on SONIA, ICE LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency, plus a variable margin. In May 2022, the Group obtained a new \u00a3100m 364 day committed revolving credit facility, the facility remained undrawn and was subsequently cancelled in November 2022. In July 2022, the Group's existing three-year amortising Term Loan for US$200m was repaid and cancelled. Interest was charged on this agreement at a floating rate based on ICE LIBOR plus a variable margin. The margin the Group paid on this borrowing over and above standard rates was determined by the Group's net debt to EBITDA ratio.",

In January 2020 the existing US$100m fixed rate 10-year note matured and was repaid, this was replaced with a new US$100m fixed rate 10-year note (27 January 2020). On 27 June 2016, the Group issued \u00a3100m and \u20ac100m of fixed rate notes. On 6 June 2019, the Group issued a further \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m of fixed rate notes.\n\nThe table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities. Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.\n\n|                                       | Book value 2022 \u00a3m   | Fair  value  2022  \u00a3m   | Book  value  2021  \u00a3m   | Fair value 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| Cash deposits                         | 320.6                | 320.6                   | 112.8                   | 112.8                |\n| Other investments                     | 3.4                  | 3.4                     | 3.3                     | 3.3                  |\n| 2019 Club facility due 2026           | (18.0)               | (18.0)                  | (262.2)                 | (262.2)              |\n| US$200m 3 year term loan due 2023     | -                    | -                       | (125.4)                 | (125.4)              |\n| US$100m 3.75% fixed rate 10 year note | (83.0)               | (74.4)                  | (74.1)                  | (78.2)               |\n| \u20ac30m 1.08% fixed rate 7 year note     | (26.5)               | (26.3)                  | (25.2)                  | (25.5)               |\n| \u20ac70m 1.43% fixed rate 10 year note    | (61.9)               | (57.8)                  | (58.7)                  | (61.5)               |\n| \u00a330m 2.54% fixed rate 7 year note     | (30.0)               | (29.7)                  | (30.0)                  | (30.3)               |\n| \u00a370m 2.80% fixed rate 10 year note    | (70.0)               | (64.8)                  | (70.0)                  | (71.9)               |\n| \u20ac50m 1.18% fixed rate 8 year note     | (44.2)               | (40.1)                  | (41.9)                  | (43.5)               |\n| \u00a365m 2.46% fixed rate 8 year note     | (65.0)               | (58.1)                  | (65.0)                  | (65.7)               |\n| US$60m 3.70% fixed rate 10 year note  | (49.8)               | (45.4)                  | (44.5)                  | (47.4)               |\n| Other bank borrowings                 | (51.6)               | (51.6)                  | (34.0)                  | (34.0)               |\n| Other loans                           | (22.6)               | (22.6)                  | (14.5)                  | (14.5)               |\n| Contingent consideration              | (9.9)                | (9.9)                   | (26.1)                  | (26.1)               |\n| Preference share capital              | (1.1)                | (1.1)                   | -                       | -                    |\n| Forward foreign currency contracts    | (1.3)                | (1.3)                   | (2.3)                   | (2.3)                |\n\nFor financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one-year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short-term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.",

The three classes of preference shares rank pari passu with each other but ahead of the ordinary shares on a winding up. Rights on a winding up are limited to repayment of capital and any arrears of dividends.\n\n## Borrowing facilities\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3579.3m (2021: \u00a3334.4m). In addition, the Group had other undrawn facilities of \u00a353.1m (2021: \u00a340.1m) available. Of the Group's total committed facilities of \u00a31,122.5m, \u00a31,066.0m expire after 2023. New and repaid borrowings disclosed in the Group Statement of Cash Flows reflect routine short-term cash management, comprising regular monthly drawdowns and repayments on the Group's revolving credit facilities. It also reflects the repayments made to the Group's revolving credit facility and the term loan facility following the business disposal.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee. Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk. Regular reports are received from all sectors and regional operating units to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken. In the management definition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. The Group's risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group's foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so. Currency exposure arising from significant one-off transactions (for example acquisitions or disposals) is reviewed and hedged through forward contracts if required.\n\nFor 2022, had the Group's basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker/stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been \u00a327.6m (2021: \u00a329.4m) lower/higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Group's overseas entities, and equity would have been \u00a3162.4m (2021: \u00a3156.5m) lower/higher.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group Accounts continued\n\n## 20. Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Cash flow hedging\n\nDuring the year, the Group held two instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency on a highly probable future business disposal and debt repayment (hedged items). As at 31 December 2021, the combined nominal value of the contracts was \u00a3601.9m and the average forward contract rates were 0.85 (EUR:GBP) and 1.12 (EUR:USD). These contracts were contingent on the successful completion of the business disposal, were designated as cash flow hedges and provided certainty over approximately 85% of the estimated FX exposure on these forecast future transactions. The forecast future transactions were completed in the year ended 31 December 2022 and the associated instruments settled. The cumulative cash flow hedging reserve of \u00a36.5m credit (2021: \u00a33.7m credit) and cost of hedging reserves of \u00a36.0m debit (2021: \u00a36.0m debit) were reclassified to the income statement and reported within the gain on business disposal. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\nThe Group also holds forward foreign currency contracts to hedge certain intercompany loans. The contracts are classified as fair value through profit and loss and had a carrying amount of \u00a31.3m liability at 31 December 2022, reported within trade and other payables. As at 31 December 2022 the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was \u00a3128.1m (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. In 2016, the Group had a policy of maintaining no more than 60% of its gross borrowings at fixed interest rates in normal circumstances. During 2016, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3136m special dividend and consequent increase in core debt requirements. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a3100m and \u20ac100m with an average maturity of 2.6 years and interest rate of 2.07%. During 2017, the policy formally increased the upper limit for fixed rate debt to 75% of gross borrowings. During 2019, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3151.5m special dividend. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m with an average maturity of 5.1 years and interest rate of 2.49%. In January 2020 the Group repaid its US$100m 10-year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 5.94%, and replaced it with a US$100m 10-year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 3.75%. At 31 December 2022, approximately 70% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, aside from the loan notes referred to above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group's fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 2.55% (2021: 2.53%). As at 31 December 2022, the Group's floating rate liabilities are based on SONIA, ICE LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency.\n\nBased on the above, had interest rates moved by 100 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post-tax profits would have moved by \u00a33.6m (2021: \u00a35.1m) due to a change in interest expense on the Group's floating rate borrowings.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.\n\nOn a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Group's cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders. The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital.\n\nIn order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt. Given the Group's strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 44 to 47.\n\nUnderlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group. The Group's ROIC now stands at 14.1% against a post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.5%. The Group's target is to maintain ROIC at two to three times WACC over the long-term. In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure its ability to service its debt. Both net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2022. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 44 to 47. The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year. Additional information on progress against Key Performance Indicators can be found on pages 48 to 51.",

Provisions for remediation costs are made when there is a present obligation, it is probable that expenditures for remediation work will be required, and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. The costs are based on currently available facts and prior experience. Environmental liabilities are recorded at the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled at the balance sheet date. Remediation of environmental damage typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin. In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available. Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly, and the timing and quantum of costs are inherently uncertain. The level of environmental provision is based on management's best estimate of the most likely outcome for each individual exposure.\n\nDuring the year, site restoration provisions have been made for certain leased sites with an existing obligation to restore the environment or dismantle assets. The provisions are based on currently available facts and prior experience and are recorded at the estimated amount as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the size of the provisions and utilisation timescales, the impact is not material.\n\n## 22.

Also granted in the year were 16,914 shares under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and 6,693 shares under the Restricted Share Plan.\n\nDuring the year consideration of \u00a33.6m was received on the exercise of options over 90,189 shares. The options were satisfied with shares transferred from the Group's employee share trusts. Since the year end a further 1,299 shares have been transferred from the trusts.

Employees then enter into a savings contract over three years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved. Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract. For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2022          | 2021          |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Grant date                          | 15 Sep 2022   | 16 Sep 2021   |\n| Share price at grant date           | 6568p         | 9144p         |\n| Exercise price                      | 5509p         | 7327p         |\n| Number of employees                 | 646           | 727           |\n| Shares under option                 | 69,318        | 55,474        |\n| Vesting period                      | Three years   | Three years   |\n| Expected volatility                 | 26%           | 20%           |\n| Option life                         | Six months    | Six months    |\n| Risk free rate                      | 3.1%          | 0.3%          |\n| Dividend yield                      | 1.6%          | 1.0%          |\n| Possibility of forfeiture           | 7.5% p.a.     | 7.5% p.a.     |\n| Fair value per option at grant date | 1758.1p       | 2094.0p       |\n| Option pricing model                | Black Scholes | Black Scholes |",

Share-based payments continued\n\n## Croda International Plc Performance Share Plan 2014 ('PSP')\n\nThe PSP scheme was established in 2014 and replaced the Company's previous Executive long-term incentive plans. The PSP provides for awards of free shares (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years dependent upon an EPS performance related sliding scale (non-market condition), an NPP growth measure (non-market condition), sustainability conditions in relation to decarbonisation roadmaps and emissions (non-market conditions) and the Group's total shareholder return (market condition). The PSP is discussed in detail in the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 102 to 140). Shares (on an after-tax basis) are subject to a two-year post vesting holding period. For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2022                  | 2022                  | 2021                   | 2021                  |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                     | Market condition      | Non-market condition  | Market  condition      | Non-market condition  |\n| Grant date                          | 22 Mar 2022           | 22 Mar 2022           | 24 Mar 2021            | 24 Mar 2021           |\n| Share price at grant date           | 7390p                 | 7390p                 | 6401p                  | 6401p                 |\n| Number of employees                 | 67                    | 67                    | 68                     | 68                    |\n| Shares under conditional award      | 42,676                | 79,254                | 45,546                 | 84,585                |\n| Vesting period                      | Three                 | Three                 | Three                  | Three                 |\n|                                     | years                 | years                 | years                  | years                 |\n| Expected volatility                 | 24%                   | 24%                   | 20%                    | 20%                   |\n| Dividend yield                      | 1.4%                  | 1.4%                  | 1.4%                   | 1.4%                  |\n| Possibility of forfeiture           | 3.45% p.a.            | 3.45% p.a.            | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.            |\n| Fair value per option at grant date | 3111p                 | 7098p                 | 2420p                  | 6136p                 |\n| Option pricing model                | Closed form valuation | Closed form valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form valuation |\n\n| A reconciliation of option movements over the year is as follows:               | 2022      | 2022                               | 2021      | 2021                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Number    | Weighted  average  exercise  price | Number    | Weighted average exercise  price |\n| Outstanding at 1 January                                                        | 426,300   | -                                  | 461,005   | -                                |\n| Granted                                                                         | 121,930   | -                                  | 130,131   | -                                |\n| Forfeited                                                                       | (14,536)  | -                                  | (108,077) | -                                |\n| Exercised                                                                       | (134,579) | -                                  | (56,759)  | -                                |\n| Outstanding at 31 December                                                      | 399,115   | -                                  | 426,300   | -                                |\n| For options exercised in year, weighted average share price at date of exercise |           | 6870p                              |           | 6205p                            |\n| Weighted average remaining life at 31 December (years)                          | 1.2       |                                    | 1.3       |                                  |\n\n## Croda International Plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan ('DBSP')\n\nThe DBSP scheme was established in 2014. Under the DBSP, one third of any annual bonuses due to certain senior executives are deferred. The size of award is determined by the amount of the total bonus divided by one third and converted into a number of Croda shares using the market value of shares at the time the award is granted. Awards are increased by the number of shares equating to the equivalent value of any dividend paid during the option period. The awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant unless the recipient has been dismissed for cause. There are no performance conditions applied to the award. The DBSP is also discussed in the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 102 to 140).\n\n|                                | 2022        | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Grant date                     | 22 Mar 2022 | -      |\n| Share price at grant date      | 7390p       | -      |\n| Number of employees            | 11          | -      |\n| Shares under conditional award | 16,914      | -      |\n| Vesting period                 | Three years | -      |",

Under the scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month. For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years' service. The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.\n\n## 24. Shareholders' equity\n\nCroda International Plc Qualifying Share Ownership Trust (QUEST), Croda International Plc Employee Benefit Trust (CIPEBT) and Croda International Plc AESOP Trust (AESOP) each hold shares purchased on the open market or transferred from treasury shares to satisfy the future issue of shares under the Group's share option schemes. As at 31 December 2022 the QUEST had a net amount due from the Company of \u00a319.8m (2021: \u00a316.1m) and held 57,216 (2021: 30,640) shares transferred at a nil cost (2021: nil cost) with a market value of \u00a33.8m (2021: \u00a33.1m). As at 31 December 2022 the CIPEBT was financed by a repayable on demand loan to the Company of \u00a337.8m (2021: \u00a326.9m) and held 688 (2021: 910) shares transferred at a nil cost (2021: nil cost) with a market value of \u00a30.1m (2021: \u00a30.1m).\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the AESOP had issued all its previously held shares, as financed by the Company, and thus had no residual loan balance with the Company. All of the shares held by the QUEST and CIPEBT were under option at 31 December 2022 and, except for a nominal amount, the right to receive dividends has been waived.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the total number of treasury shares held was 2,901,442 (2021: 3,018,203) with a market value of \u00a3199.3m (2021: \u00a3303.2m).\n\n## 25.

The gain on business disposal includes foreign exchange gains that resulted from the settlement of proceeds and associated intercompany balances across the Group shortly following completion.\n\nIncome tax payable on the gain on business disposal has been calculated on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, applying the relevant corporation tax rates and exemptions.\n\n## 29.

These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## A. Accounting policies\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 ('FRS 100') issued by the Financial Reporting Council. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in compliance with the provisions of the Act and the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are provided in the Group financial statements of Croda International Plc.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial statements which appear on pages 202 to 207 have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquiries, including a review of forecasts, budgets and banking facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence.\n\n## Principal accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies which have been applied by the Company when preparing the financial statements are in accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101 is based on the recognition and measurement requirements of Adopted IFRSs, under which the Group financial statements have been prepared. As a result, the accounting policies of the Company are consistent with those used by the Group as presented on pages 164 to 171, except for those relating to the recognition and measurement of goodwill and the recognition of revenue, which are not directly relevant to the Company financial statements. Investments are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Investments are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment, at which point the carrying value is reviewed against the underlying net assets or forecast cash generation of the entity.\n\nThe Group accounting policy for financial risk factors is also relevant to the preparation of the Company financial statements and is disclosed on pages 193 and 194.\n\n## B. Profit and loss account\n\nOf the Group's profit for the year, \u00a3505.9m (2021: \u00a32.2m) is included in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board on 27 February 2023 but which is not presented as permitted by Section 408 Companies Act 2006.\n\nIncluded in the Company profit and loss account is a profit before tax and fees on the disposal of Equus UK Topco Limited (PTIC business) of \u00a36.5m (2021: \u00a3nil). Also included is \u00a3522.9m (2021: \u00a325.4m) income from shares in Group undertakings, partly related to the PTIC business disposal, and a charge of \u00a30.3m (2021: \u00a30.2m) in respect of the Company's audit fee.\n\n## C.

Share-based payments\n\nThe total charge for the year in respect of share-based remuneration schemes was \u00a35.4m (2021: \u00a35.9m). The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.\n\nThe key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss account are set out in note 23 to the Group financial statements.\n\n## M. Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Company has guaranteed loan capital and bank overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to \u00a3153.5m (2021: \u00a3272.3m).\n\n## N.

To register, shareholders will require their investor code (IVC): this is an 11 digit number starting with five or six zeros and can be found on your dividend tax voucher or your share certificate. Receiving corporate communications by email has a number of benefits including being more environmentally friendly, reducing unnecessary waste, faster notification of information to shareholders and a reduction in company costs.\n\nShareholders who register on the above website can also check their shareholding, view their dividend history, choose their dividend options, register changes of address and dividend mandate instructions.\n\n## Share price information\n\nThe latest ordinary share price is available on our website at www.croda.com.\n\nThe middle market values of the listed share capital at 31 December 2022, or last date traded*, were as follows:\n\n| Ordinary shares        | 6663p   |\n|------------------------|---------|\n| 5.9% preference shares | 88.5p*  |\n| 6.6% preference shares | 96.5p*  |\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan ('DRIP')\n\nOrdinary shareholders may wish to know about this plan, which allows you to use your dividends to buy further shares in Croda.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder information continued\n\n## How to avoid scams\n\n- \u00b7 Treat all unexpected calls, emails and text messages with caution. Don't assume they're genuine, even if the person seems to know some basic information about you.\n- \u00b7 Don't be pressured into acting quickly. A genuine bank or financial services firm won't mind waiting if you want time to think.\n- \u00b7 Never give out your bank account or credit card details unless you are certain who you are dealing with.\n- \u00b7 If you're buying a financial product such as a loan, insurance, investment or pension, only deal with an FCA-authorised firm - check the FS Register to see if the firm is registered. Always access the Register from the FCA website, rather than through links in emails or on a firm's website (it might be part of the scam).\n- \u00b7 Double-check the URL and contact details of a firm in case it's a 'clone firm' pretending to be a real firm, such as your bank or a genuine investment firm.\n- \u00b7 Check the list of unauthorised firms and individuals the FCA have received complaints about. If the firm isn't on their list, don't assume it's legitimate - it may not have been reported to them yet.\n- \u00b7 Check your bank account and credit card statements regularly.\n- \u00b7 Don't give access to your device by downloading software or an app from a source you don't trust. Scammers may be able to view, take control of your device and access your bank account.\n- \u00b7 Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more about investment scams.\n\nYou can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## Secretary and Registered Office\n\nTom Brophy (Company Secretary) Cowick Hall, Snaith, Goole, East Yorkshire DN14 9AA\n\nTel: +44 (0)1405 860551\n\nFax: +44 (0)1405 861767\n\nWebsite: www.croda.com\n\nRegistered in England number 206132\n\n## Registrars\n\nLink Group\n\nPXS1, Central Square\n\n29 Wellington Street, Leeds, LS1 4DL\n\nTel:\n\n0371 664 0300 (from UK) +44 (0) 371 664 0300 (from overseas)\n\nCalls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider.
