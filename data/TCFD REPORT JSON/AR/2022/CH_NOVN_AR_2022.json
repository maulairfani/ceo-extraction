In 2022, we initiated a major  transformation of our organization to further improve our innovation capabilities and align with our growth strategy as a pure-play medicines company.\n\nWe expect these changes to simplify our business, enhance accountabilities and strengthen our commercial activities by enabling us to better focus on our in-market products and high-value pipeline assets. Overall, our e/fforts are set to support our long-term sales and profit growth and help us create sustainable shareholder value.\n\nAs part of this transformation, which includes our intention to spin o/ff our Sandoz generics and biosimilars Division, we merged our Oncology and Pharmaceuticals commercial organizations and created a new Operations organization that combines our manufacturing and services activities. Besides sub stantial cost savings, we expect these steps to increase our operational agility and strengthen our business in key markets such as the United States and China.\n\nThe organizational changes, which we expect to finalize in 2023, complete the portfolio shift we started in 2014. Over this time, we have divested several non-core businesses and spun o/ff our eye-care division Alcon. With a view to boosting our innovation power, we have also made substantial investments in cutting-edge technology platforms, including gene and/uni00A0cell therapy, radioligand therapy and RNA/uni00A0technology.\n\nNovartis delivered on its sales and operating profit targets in 2022 despite the  challenges of a volatile macroeconomic environment and while executing on our ongoing transformation, which entailed job/uni00A0reductions due to structural changes. This performance was supported by cost discipline and continued operational streamlining, as  well  as  the  strong  uptake  of/uni00A0 recently  launched medicines, such as multiple sclerosis treatment Kesimpta , and continued strong demand for our cardiovascular  medicine Entresto and  psoriasis  treatment Cosentyx .\n\nLast year also saw new leadership at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and our Global Drug Development organization, the research and development (R&D) engines of Novartis, and a renewed focus on improving governance and speeding up the transition between early drug discovery and clinical development. These measures should help further strengthen our portfolio of medicines, which we have consistently broadened in recent years with launches including cancer treatments Pluvicto and/uni00A0 Scemblix .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have also further intensified our e/fforts to integrate our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities into our daily business, which we believe is vital for the success of Novartis. Among a variety of steps aimed at reaching as many patients as possible, we renewed our commitment to continue our R&D e/fforts in neglected tropical diseases and to work further toward the elimination of malaria. In addition, we are partnering with the American Society of Hematology to deepen our e/fforts to fight against sickle cell disease in Africa.\n\nThe Board of Directors also remained vigilant in its governance oversight e/fforts by putting added emphasis on values such as integrity as Novartis pivots towards becoming a high-performance, pure-play medicines company. Likewise, the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors are keeping up the intensive dialogue with stake holder groups and working towards achieving our vision to be the most valued and trusted medicines companies in the world.\n\nI thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 3.2% to CHF 3.20 at the next Annual General  Meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJoerg Reinhardt Chair of the Board of Directors",

        "page_content": "## CEO's letter\n\n2022 was a year of transformation for Novartis. After more than USD 100 billion in acquisitions and divestures over the last several years, our structural transformation from a diversified healthcare conglomerate into a focused, innovative medicines company will be largely complete after the planned spin-o/ff of Sandoz in 2023.\n\nWe also begin 2023 with a simplified organizational structure that will spur innovation and give us a stronger foundation for growth in a rapidly changing global business environment.\n\nWhile Novartis has pursued bold portfolio change, core elements of our company remain the same. Our vision is to become the most trusted and valued medicines company in the world - valued not only for our business performance, but also for the di/fference our innovation makes for patients and society.\n\nThe world is counting on us to succeed. Fewer than 10% of diseases known to a/ffect humans are currently treatable, and globally, people live an average of 10 years with a disease or disability. Yet new treatments broadly still reach only a fraction of eligible patients, and manageable conditions like heart disease cause millions of avoidable deaths each year.\n\nOur performance in 2022 showed that we are making progress in addressing society's greatest disease burdens. Our focus on cardiovascular disease, for example, gives countries and healthcare systems solutions to address the world's leading cause of death and disability. Entresto, our medicine for heart failure and hypertension, is estimated to be treating around 10 million patients worldwide, while our cholesterol-lowering siRNA treatment Leqvio is now approved in 70 countries.\n\nWe saw robust growth momentum across our in-market medicines. This includes stronger-than-expected uptake in the US for Pluvicto , our novel radioligand therapy for advanced prostate cancer, highlighting our ability to turn the promise of next-generation medicines into a reality for patients.\n\nDespite challenging macroeconomic conditions and an unstable geopolitical environment, we delivered a solid financial performance that underscores the progress we are making, with 4% growth in net sales in constant currencies (cc) and 8% growth (cc) in core operating income compared with the previous year. Looking ahead, we aim to generate sales growth of 4% CAGR over the next five years, and grow above peer median beyond 2027.\n\nOur investments in R&D are key to achieving these ambitions. In 2022, we saw a positive Phase III readout for iptacopan, which was discovered at NIBR, in a rare and deadly blood disorder. We saw an important positive Phase III result for Pluvicto in earlier lines of prostate cancer. And\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe also reported positive Phase III results for Cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa, o/ffering the potential to expand one of our most successful medicines and bring a new treatment option to patients with this painful skin disease.\n\nAs we continue innovating for patients, millions around the world are still without proper access to healthcare. Translating the latest science into lasting progress requires us to work with healthcare systems and other stakeholders to advance access for underserved patients in low- and middle-income countries, while also tackling access barriers in some of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nIn the US, for example, we expanded our 10-year Beacon of Hope initiative, which seeks to address racial disparities in healthcare, including by increasing diversity among clinical trial participants and investigators. We also pledged to invest USD 250 million in R&D for the treatment of malaria and neglected tropical diseases, building on our decades-long commitment to global health priorities. We continue to make progress in other aspects of our ESG agenda, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by nearly half since 2016.\n\nAs we look to the future as a focused medicines company, our dedication to innovation and excellence will drive us forward. We have set clear growth ambitions and we are confident we will meet them. Through reshaping Novartis, we are set to reimagine medicine for decades to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->",

You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as well as our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and share price, could be materially adversely a/ffected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered material.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Key products and commercial priorities\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commercial success of our new or existing key products. The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, unexpected side e/ffects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products.\n\nHealthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various\n\nreasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of e/fficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other reasons. The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention and management focus. Such competition could significantly a/ffect the revenue from our products and our results of operations. This impact could also be compounded to the extent that such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales.\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to successfully prioritize, integrate and execute our research and development programs for new products or new indications for existing products, given our focus on innovative medicines\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe engage in extensive and costly research and development  activities,  both  through  our  own  internal resources and through collaborations with third parties, in an e/ffort to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products that address unmet and changing medical needs, and that are commercially successful. Our ability to grow our business and our product pipeline; to replace sales lost due to branded competition, entry of generics, or other reasons; and to bring to market products that take advantage of new and potentially disruptive technologies, including cell, gene and radioligand therapies, depends in significant part on the success of these e/fforts.\n\nFailure to successfully develop our pipeline products is typically the result of the inherent uncertainty of science, suboptimal internal execution, or both. Key elements of internal execution include our ability to prioritize our investments on our highest potential value assets, optimize  the  transition  of  assets  from  research  to",

Information on the Company-  Item  4.B  Business  overview-Innovative Medicines-Research and development' with regards to the research and development e/fforts of our Innovative Medicines Division.\n\nOur new products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing and are approved by means of a highly complex, lengthy, and expensive approval process that varies substantially from country to country and may have very specific requirements for the recruitment of patients for clinical trials. We face increasing and evolving regulatory approval and reimbursement requirements. If we fail to successfully progress late-stage assets and the core elements of drug development for key programs, this could have a negative impact on the development of our product pipeline, and ultimately on the success of our business and our financial results.\n\nIn addition, in the US it is becoming increasingly challenging to adequately recruit a su/fficient number of US patients in clinical trials due to new and changing requirements for recruitment of patients into such trials. As a result, we may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to support the desired indications and product profile for a particular disease that is needed to drive clinical adoption of our new products, and thereby achieve the full potential of our assets (also known as the 'target product profile'). Similarly, the post-approval regulatory burden has also increased. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals for our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, change to product specifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability.\n\nThe  clinical  testing,  regulatory  processes  and post-approval activities described above become more di/fficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during periods of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This is due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials, as well as ensuring the supply of trial materials. For a further description of the research and development of, and approval processes for, the products of our Innovative Medicines Division, see the sections headed 'Research and development' and 'Regulation' included in the description of our Innovative Medicines Division under 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines.'\n\nOur Sandoz Division has made, and expects to continue to make, significant investments in the development of biotechnology-based, 'biologic' medicines that are intended for sale as bioequivalent or 'biosimilar' versions of currently marketed biotechnology products. While the development of such products is typically significantly less costly and complex than the development  of  the  equivalent  originator  medicines,  it  is nonetheless significantly more costly and complex than that  for  typical  small-molecule  generic  products. For/uni00A0more information about the research and development  e/fforts  of  our  Sandoz  Division,  see  'Item  4. Information  on  the  Company-Item  4.B  Business\n\noverview- Sandoz-Development and registration.' In addition, many countries do not yet have fully developed legislative or regulatory pathways to facilitate the development of biosimilars, and to permit their sale in such a way that they are readily substitutable alternatives to the originator product. Further delays or di/fficulties in the development or marketing of biosimilars could put at risk the significant investments that Sandoz has made, and will continue to make, in its Biopharmaceuticals business. Failure to successfully develop and market biosimilars could have a material adverse e/ffect on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole. For more information about the approval processes that must be followed to market Sandoz Division products, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Sandoz-Regulation.'\n\nFurthermore, our research and development activities must be conducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data privacy, current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, diversity and inclusion in the recruitment of patients to clinical trials, and animal welfare. Should we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative financial consequences as a result of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that investments in research and development activities may not bring the expected benefits to the Group.\n\n## Pricing, reimbursement and access\n\n## Risk description\n\nPricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur business has continuously experienced significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many sources, including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy changes; and public controversies, political debate, investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may negatively impact both our product pricing and the availability of our products.\n\nIn addition, we face numerous cost-containment measures imposed by governments and other payers. These include government-imposed industrywide price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pricing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based on cost-benefit analyses, the importation of drugs from lower-cost countries to higher-cost countries, the shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher co-payments and co-pay accumulator programs, the limiting of physicians' ability to choose among competing medicines, the mandatory substitution of generic drugs for the patented equivalent, pressure on physicians to reduce  the  prescribing  of  patented  prescription medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property",

        "page_content": "protections, and growing requirements for increased transparency on pricing. For more information on price controls, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Price controls.'\n\nRecent trends in the external environment may have an impact on the likelihood of these pricing and reimbursement pressures occurring. A worldwide slowdown in economic growth following the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine (contributing to challenges such as high energy costs and inflation) has led to increased strain on fiscal budgets in many major economies. In addition, legislative developments such as those in the US (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act) and in Europe (e.g., the EU Joint Health Technology Assessment) pose potential further pressures on pricing and timelines for reimbursement in these countries.  These external factors may materially a/ffect our ability to achieve value-based prices; to achieve and maintain an acceptable return on our investments in the research and development of our products; and may impact our ability to research and develop new products.\n\nIn addition, our Sandoz Division has faced and may continue to face intense competition from other generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical companies that aggressively compete for market share, including through significant price competition. Such competitive actions may increase the costs and risks associated with our e/fforts to introduce and market generic and biosimilar products, may delay the introduction or marketing of such products, and may further limit the prices at which we are able to sell these products. In particular, in the US in past years, industrywide price competition among generic pharmaceutical companies and consolidation of buyers caused significant declines in sales and profits of Sandoz.\n\n## Alliances, acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to identify, execute, and/or realize the expected benefits from our external business opportunities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nAs part of our strategy, from time to time we acquire and divest products or entire businesses and enter into strategic alliances and collaborations. For example, in February 2022, we closed the acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics. This strategy is partly dependent on our ability to identify strategic external business opportunities and to close transactions with third parties on acceptable terms.\n\nOnce the terms of a strategic transaction have been agreed with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all, nor can we be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our e/fforts on such transactions can also divert management's attention from our existing businesses.\n\nAfter a transaction is closed, e/fforts to develop and market acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. This may occur\n\ndue to di/fficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within expected time frames or at all; differences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis standards, including, for example, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which can be costly and time-consuming to remediate. Furthermore, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin o/ff businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose, or that any completed divestment or spin-o/ff will achieve the expected strategic benefits, operational e/fficiencies or opportunities, or that the divestment or spin-o/ff will ultimately maximize shareholder value.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\n## Risk description\n\nExpiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany products of our Innovative Medicines Division are protected by intellectual property rights, which may provide us with exclusive rights to market those products for a limited time, and to enable our purpose of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our research and development. However, the strength and duration of those rights can vary significantly from product to product and from country to country, and they may be successfully challenged by third parties or governmental authorities.\n\nLoss of intellectual property protection and the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for a patented branded medicine in a country typically result in a significant and rapid reduction in net sales and operating income for the branded product. Such competition can occur after successful challenges to intellectual property rights or the regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual property rights. Such competition can also result from the entry of generic or biosimilar versions of another medicine in the same therapeutic  class  as  one  of  our  drugs  or  in  a  competing therapeutic class, from a Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property by governmental authorities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual property and governing laws in certain countries around the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufacturers may sometimes conduct so-called 'launches at risk' of products that are still under legal challenge for infringement, or whose patents are still under legal challenge for validity, before final resolution of legal proceedings.\n\nWe also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets,",

If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, then our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses.\n\nWe may also be subject to assertions of intellectual property rights against our innovative medicines by third parties. If successful, these actions may involve payment of future royalties or damages, for example for patent infringement, and may also involve injunctive relief requiring the removal of one or more dosage strengths of a product from the market (or removal of a therapeutic indication from the product's approved labeling) for some period of time or throughout the life of the asserted intellectual property right. Such damages or such an injunction may have a material impact on our operating income and net sales.\n\nIn any given year, we may experience a potentially significant impact on our net sales from products that have already lost intellectual property protections, as well as products that may lose protection during the year. Because we may have substantially reduced marketing and research and development expenses related to products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the initial loss of protection for a product during a given year could also have an impact on our operating income for that year in an amount corresponding to a significant portion of the product's lost sales. The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors. These include, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or di/fficulty of manufacturing a competitor product and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single competitor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceutical products in such geographies; and our ability to successfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also o/ffset the income lost to generic or biosimilar competition. For more information on the patent and  generic  competition  status  of  our  Innovative Medicines Division products, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Intellectual property.'\n\n## Strategic transformations\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to meet organizational transformation programs objectives and/or unintended adverse impacts on our business\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nFrom time to time, we reassess our business organization to ensure we have the optimal structure with which to execute our strategy. In April 2022, we announced a new  organizational  structure  and  operating  model designed to support our innovation, growth, and productivity ambitions as a focused medicines company. See 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Overview.'\n\nIn addition, in October 2021 we announced the commencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division. After exploring all options, ranging from retaining the business  to  separation,  on  August  25,  2022,  we announced our intention to separate our Sandoz Division into a new publicly traded standalone company, by way of a 100% spin-o/ff in order to maximize shareholder value. See 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Sandoz.'\n\nOur inability to successfully implement our new organizational structure and operating model or to successfully complete the spin-o/ff of our Sandoz Division could have a material adverse e/ffect on the success of the Group as a whole, and could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition. The overall extent and pace of these organizational changes, and the additional workload and complexity for our employees in some areas, could trigger uncertainty, stress and fatigue among employees, potentially resulting in instability within the organization that could lead to failure of these organizational changes to succeed or to achieve the desired benefits. As a result, the expected benefits of these organizational changes may never be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nIncreasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being judged by performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can contribute to the long-term sustainability of our company's performance. An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and to meet societal expectations can result in negative impacts on our recruitment, retention, operations, financial results, reputation, and share price.\n\nTopics related to large societal changes such as social inequity, access to medicines and climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. For example, a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions. Our actions related",

For this reason, the role of our Board of Directors and executive o/fficers in supervising various sustainability issues is becoming increasingly important.\n\nWe actively manage a broad range of ESG matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment. We have created a Sustainability & ESG O/ffice, which, in coordination with the ESG Committee of the Executive Committee of Novartis, is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets. However, considering investors' increasing focus on ESG matters, the fast pace of change of external expectations, and a range of upcoming regulations, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet society or investors' expectations.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Cybersecurity and IT systems\n\n## Risk description\n\nCybersecurity breaches, data loss and catastrophic loss of IT systems\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are heavily dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology (IT) systems, including internet-based systems to support our business processes. We have also outsourced significant parts of our IT infrastructure to third-party providers, and we currently use these providers to perform business-critical IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, whether our own or those of the third-party providers we contract, and we have experienced and may in the future experience such cybersecurity threats and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT systems make them potentially vulnerable to external and internal security threats; outages; malicious intrusions and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-sponsored cybercrimes; malware; misplaced data, lost data or data errors; programming or human errors; or other similar events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of such threats and attacks has increased, as virtual and remote working has become more widely used, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to our reliance on third-party providers, we have experienced and may in the future experience interruptions, delays or outages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by or caused by third-party providers. Interruptions in the service provided by these third parties could a/ffect our ability to perform critical tasks.\n\nA significant information security or other event, such as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party service provider, has previously and could in the future negatively impact important business processes, such as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of data and information to health authorities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obligations, and communication between employees and with third parties. IT issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead to, the compromise of trade secrets or other intellectual property that could be sold and used by competitors to accelerate the development or manufacturing of competing products; to the compromise of personal financial and health information; and to the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strategies and information about network infrastructure, which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions in software or medical devices that make significant use of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients.\n\nAlthough we have experienced some of the events described above, to date they have not had a material impact on our operations. Nonetheless, the occurrence of any of the events described above in the future could disrupt our business operations and result in enforcement actions or liability, including potential government fines and penalties, claims for damages, and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\nAny significant events of this type could require us to expend significant resources beyond those we already invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or enhance our protective measures, and to enable the continuity of our business.\n\n## Fragmented IT landscape and strategic technology programs implementation\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to address fragmented business processes, unclear data ownership, and IT applications and infrastructure nearing their end-of-life, may disrupt our core business processes\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on various IT systems to operate our complex global business. Historically, while highly overlapping data strategy and architectural needs exist across our businesses, in the past we built distinct solutions across both prior business units and our various geographies, which have led to a fragmented and complex landscape of IT systems.  Additionally, several of our current IT systems are reaching the end of their useful life, which, together with our fragmented IT landscape, may cause disruptions to our operational stability. As a result, we started to implement several companywide IT programs with a view toward replacing and consolidating outdated IT systems. For example, we have completed the conceptual design phase and started to build a new global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that seeks to simplify, standardize and digitize processes in our",

We expect the first implementation of our new ERP system to begin in the first quarter of 2024, with full implementation by 2028. In addition, we are also implementing other IT projects, seeking to simplify and standardize our processes, systems and tools, and create a unified data marketplace. Implementation and operation of the new ERP system and other IT projects involves certain risks, including a failure of the new ERP system and other IT projects to operate as expected, a failure to properly integrate with other systems we use, potential loss of data or information, compliance issues, or cost overruns and delays. Any disruptions or malfunctions of the new ERP system and other IT projects could cause critical information to be delayed, lost, defective, corrupted,  or  rendered  inadequate  or  inaccessible, which could negatively impact our operations and the e/ffectiveness of our internal controls.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals in key roles and markets\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on attracting and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our businesses and functions to achieve our business objectives. If we are unable to sustain our supply of key personnel - including senior members of our scientific and management teams, high-quality researchers and development specialists and skilled employees in key markets - our ability to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely a/ffected. In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the diversity of our workforce may decline.\n\nThe market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive, and we anticipate this trend will persist longterm. We face a challenge to attract and retain top talent in several areas, including biology, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufacturing, IT, oncology, and advanced therapy platforms (i.e., gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and 'xRNA'). In addition, many biotechnology companies have received significant inflows of capital and are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent.\n\nIn recent years, we have adopted new ways of working  that  include  location  flexibility  and  increasingly recruiting from a global pool of talent. However, the success of our business continues to depend on having employees who possess local knowledge of, and experience in, our key markets. The external talent supply is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for Novartis. In the United States, China and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, as they find ample career opportunities available closer to home.\n\nIn addition, in April 2022 we announced a new, integrated organizational structure and operating model. The\n\ncorporate reorganization undertaken to implement this new organizational structure has resulted in significant redundancies and senior leadership changes that may reduce  morale,  increase  employee  distraction  and prompt higher voluntary turnover, any of which could negatively impact our competitiveness and ability to achieve strategic objectives. For more information on this new organizational structure see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Overview.'\n\nThe risks associated with the challenging external talent market and the implementation of our new organizational structure will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and e/ffectively develop employees and maintain an internal pipeline with critical skills, experiences, and leadership to deliver our business priorities. As a result, development, engagement, motivation, succession planning and performance rewards for our critical talent are essential to achieve our business priorities.\n\n## Third-party management\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe outsource the performance of certain key business functions and services to third parties. Such activities include research and development collaborations, manufacturing operations, warehousing and distribution, certain finance functions, sales and marketing activities, data management and others. Some third parties, particularly those in developing countries, do not have internal compliance systems or resources comparable to those of Novartis. As a result, our investment and e/fforts in relation to third party management include focusing on risk management and the oversight of such third parties.\n\nOur reliance on third parties poses certain risks, including the misappropriation of our intellectual property, the failure of the third party to comply with regulatory and quality assurance requirements, the failure of the third party to comply with environmental, anti-bribery and human rights standards and regulations, unexpected supply disruptions, breach of our agreement by the third party, and the unexpected termination or nonrenewal of our agreement by the third party.\n\nIn addition, governments require, and the public expects, Novartis to take responsibility for and report on compliance  with  various  human  rights,  responsible sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other actions of our third-party contractors around the world.\n\nUltimately, if third parties fail to meet their obligations to us, we may lose our investment in the relationship with the third parties or fail to receive the expected benefits of our agreements with such third parties. In addition, should any of these third parties fail to comply with the law or our standards, or should they otherwise act inappropriately while performing services for us, there is a risk that we could be held responsible for their acts, that our reputation may su/ffer, and that penalties may be imposed on us.",

Such legal requirements are extensive and complex.\n\nThe laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry and applicable to us are broad in scope, are subject to change, and have evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. For example, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to various significant legal proceedings, such as private party litigation, government investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. These types of matters may take various forms based on evolving government enforcement and private party litigation priorities, and could include, for example, matters pertaining to pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cybersecurity; data privacy; regulatory interactions; and intellectual property. Such matters can involve civil and/or criminal proceedings and can retroactively challenge practices previously considered to be legal.\n\nThere is also a risk that governance for our medical and patient support activities, and our interactions with governments, public o/fficials/institutions, healthcare professionals,  healthcare  organizations  and  patient organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may undertake activities based on improper or inadequate scientific justification.\n\nOur Sandoz Division may from time to time seek approval to market a generic version of a product before the expiration of patents claimed by the marketer of the patented product. We do this in cases in which we believe the relevant patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by our generic product. As a result, a/ffiliates of our Sandoz Division frequently face patent litigation, and in certain circumstances we may make the business decision to market a generic product even though patent infringement actions are still pending. Should we elect to do so and conduct a so-called 'launch at risk,' we could face substantial damages if the final court decision is adverse to us.\n\nLegal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, such legal proceedings and investigations, even if meritless, may a/ffect our reputation, may create a risk of\n\npotential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, and may lead to civil litigation and/or criminal exposure. As a result, having considered all relevant factors, we have in the past and may again in the future enter into major settlements of such claims without bringing them to final legal adjudication by courts or other such bodies, despite having potentially significant defenses against them, to limit the risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such settlements may require us to pay significant sums of money and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for extended periods.\n\nFor information on significant legal matters pending against us, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Commitments and contingent liabilities.'\n\nNew requirements may also be imposed on us due to  changing  government  and  societal  expectations regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable corporate behavior generally. For example, we are faced with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we do business, including with respect to disclosures concerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, healthcare  organizations  and  patient  organizations. These laws and regulations include requirements that we disclose payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as information relating to the costs and prices for our products, which represent evolving standards of acceptable corporate behavior. These requirements may incur significant costs, including substantial time and additional resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions with healthcare professionals and organizations into compliance with these evolving standards.\n\nIn addition to legal and regulatory requirements, we aim to meet the evolving societal expectations of the public and our investors regarding ethical behavior and the increasing importance placed on ESG matters.\n\nTo support our e/fforts to comply with the many requirements that impact us, we have a significant global ethics and compliance program in place, and we devote substantial time and resources to e/fforts to ensure that we conduct business in a lawful manner, and in line with society's expectations. Despite our e/fforts, an actual or alleged failure to comply with the law or with heightened public expectations could lead to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance, or to other significant losses.\n\n## Manufacturing and product quality\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe development and manufacture of our products is complex and heavily regulated by governmental health authorities around the world.

Any significant failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory  requirements,  or  with  health  authorities' expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical trials, shut down production facilities or production lines, and recall commercial products. A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and reputational harm.\n\nIn addition, the technically complex manufacturing processes required to manufacture many of our products increase the risk of both production failures and product recalls and can increase the cost of producing our goods. Some of our products require a supply of highly specialized raw materials, such as cell lines, tissue samples, bacteria, viral strains and radioisotopes. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as CAR/hyphen.capT therapies, gene therapies and radioligand therapy products, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production processes or in material used have led to, and may in the future lead to, production failures or recalls. See 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B. Business overview-Sandoz-Production.'\n\n## Supply chain\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to maintain continuity of product supply\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our products and raw materials, we may rely on a single source of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products, and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and 'xRNA', all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. Due to this complexity, there is a risk of production and supply of critical raw materials failures, which may result in supply interruptions or product recalls due to manufactured products not meeting required specifications.\n\nIn addition, due to the inherent complexities of our manufacturing processes and the supply chains for advanced therapy platforms, we are required to plan our production activities and purchase of materials well in\n\nadvance. If we su/ffer from third-party raw material shortages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail to accurately predict when a new product will be approved for sale, then we may not be able to produce su/fficient product to meet demand. These issues could be made worse during a pandemic, such as the COVID19 pandemic, or geopolitical events, such as  the war in Ukraine, and could lead to (i) a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products, resulting in the short-term unavailability of critical materials; (ii) logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our inability to ship products from one place to another due to restrictions imposed as a result of a pandemic or geopolitical events and any related sanctions, which can also impact transportation and warehousing costs; or (iii) our inability to properly operate a manufacturing site due to restrictions imposed as the result of a pandemic or any issues arising from geopolitical events.\n\nOur or our third-party suppliers' inability to manage such issues could lead to shutdowns, product shortages, or to us being entirely unable to supply products to patients for an extended period of time. Furthermore, as our products are intended to promote the health of patients, such shortages or shutdowns could endanger our reputation and have led to, and could continue to lead to, significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\n## Data privacy\n\n## Risk description\n\nNoncompliance with personal data protection laws and regulations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients and other individuals' personal information, including via social media and mobile technologies. In addition, the operation of our business requires data to flow across the borders of numerous countries in which there are di/fferent, potentially conflicting, and frequently changing, data privacy laws in e/ffect. Examples of such laws include: the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took e/ffect in May 2018; the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took e/ffect in January 2020; Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law, which entered into force in September 2020; and the Personal Information Protection Law in China, which took e/ffect in November 2021. Such laws impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect, share, export or otherwise process personal information, and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons.\n\nEvents involving the substantial loss of personal information, use of personal information without a legal basis, or other privacy violations could give rise to significant liability, reputational harm, damaged relationships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary",

Such events could also lead to restrictions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders. In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these frameworks but also within individual legal frameworks themselves. This divergence may constrain the implementation of global business processes and may lead to di/fferent approaches on the use of health data for scientific research, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n\n## Falsified medicines\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of falsified medicines on patient safety, and reputational and financial harm to Novartis and our products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe continue to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to falsified medicines, which include counterfeit,  stolen,  tampered  and  illegally  diverted medicines as defined by the World Health Organization.\n\nFalsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of adverse  events  related  to  falsified  medicines  and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system a/ffect patient confidence in genuine medicines and in healthcare systems in general. These events could also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from the falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to the genuine one. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines that are not properly stored and later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Furthermore, there is a direct financial loss when, for example, falsified medicines replace sales of genuine medicines, or genuine medicines are recalled following the discovery of falsified products.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Geopolitical developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of geo- and socio-political threats\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nChallenging political conditions currently exist in various parts of the world, including an economic downturn; risk of direct conflicts between nations, such as the war in Ukraine; a global pandemic; resistance in certain areas against free trade; anti-corporate sentiment; and social unrest.\n\nThe imposition of tari/ffs, including those imposed by the US and China, and the possibility of additional tari/ffs or other trade restrictions relating to trade could have a material negative impact on our business. Given that the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations remains uncertain, we cannot yet determine the nature or extent of the potential impact on our business. For example, if tari/ffs on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical\n\ningredients (APIs) were increased, this could impact the profitability of our products and disrupt our supply chain. Increasing opposition to free trade may increase the risks we face in our e/fforts to improve and harmonize standards in regulation and intellectual property.\n\nFurthermore, significant conflicts continue in certain parts of the world. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and di/fficulties of international transactions, which could in turn significantly impact time to market and our ability to supply our products to patients in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimbursement levels for innovative therapies.\n\n## Macroeconomic developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of macroeconomic developments\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur business may be impacted by deteriorating macroeconomic and financial conditions directly a/ffecting consumers. Given that patients, in many countries, directly pay a sizable portion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that consumers may cut back on prescription drugs due to financial constraints.\n\nNegative macroeconomic developments may also adversely a/ffect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers, and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Although we make e/fforts to monitor the financial condition and liquidity of these third parties, our ability to do so is limited, and some of them may become unable to pay their bills in a timely manner or may even become insolvent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with fiscally challenged government payers, or with third parties with substantial exposure to such payers.\n\nAt the same time, significant changes, and potential future volatility in financial markets, the consumer and business environment, the competitive landscape, and the global political and security landscape make it increasingly di/fficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook that we have given or might give may be overtaken by events or may otherwise prove to be inaccurate. Although we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues and earnings at the time at which we give such guidance, based on then-current knowledge and conditions, there is a risk that such guidance or outlook will prove to be incorrect.\n\nAsset price corrections in financial markets may also result in lower returns on our financial investments. In addition, pricing pressures in developed markets resulting from e/fforts to reduce the cost of healthcare (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, which targets drug prices) may have a negative impact on our revenue and our net sales. In addition, inflation has an impact on our operating costs due to the increased cost of supplies. Higher costs for energy, raw materials, wages, and capital will increase our operating costs, potentially reducing our net sales.",

Financial Statements-Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of climate change and increased risk of major natural disasters\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nNovartis is exposed to a broad range of climate risks such as transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon pricing, and the cost of and access to capital) and physical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, sea level rise, and flooding from severe weather events), which could vary in magnitude and impact across di/fferent countries.\n\nClimate change has triggered, and may continue to trigger, the adoption of new regulatory requirements across the globe. To comply with such legislation, we may be required to increase our investment in technology to reduce our energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, legislative and regulatory action, both current and in the future, includes or could include carbon pricing, climate risk related disclosures, and changes in zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. As a result, the combined impact of these transition risks could increase our direct operating costs and impact our supply chain. We have also committed to incorporating the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework into our business, which includes providing qualitative and quantitative disclosures on climate-related topics on a recurring basis. As a result of these transition risks, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025, and carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. Any failure to achieve these commitments in the expected time frame, or at all, could result in negative impacts on our reputation, our operations, and the price of our shares.\n\nClimate change has created, and will continue to create, physical risks to our business. Some of our\n\nproduction facilities that depend on the availability of significant water supplies are located in areas where water is increasingly scarce. Other facilities are located in areas that, due to increasingly violent weather events, rising sea levels, or both, are increasingly at risk of substantial flooding. In regions where such a risk is present, this has an impact not only on our own operations but also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result in the loss of life, increased costs, business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and disruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access our medicines.\n\nFurthermore, our corporate headquarters, the headquarters of our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and a number of major Innovative Medicines Division production and research facilities are located near earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in various locations around the world. A major earthquake could result in loss of life, business interruptions and the destruction of our facilities.\n\n## Tax laws and developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nChanges in tax laws or their application\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur multinational operations are taxed under the laws of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our e/ffective tax rate, which could adversely a/ffect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in di/fferent countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially di/fferent from the amounts accrued.\n\nIn 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working toward a global tax framework that ensures that corporate income taxes are paid where consumption takes place, in addition to introducing a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are still under discussion by the OECD and political leaders. The OECD expects that the implementation of these new principles will begin globally in 2024. Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which the Group",

In 2020, the EU announced that it would introduce new centralized taxation powers (which have not yet been introduced) to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the European Commission continues to extend the application of its policies seeking to limit fiscal aid by member states to particular companies, together with the related investigation into member states' practices regarding the issuance of rulings on tax matters relating to individual companies. Although we have taken steps to comply with evolving initiatives such as these of the OECD and the EU, and we will continue to do so, significant uncertainties remain as to the outcome of our e/fforts. For more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 6. Income taxes' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.'\n\n## General risks\n\n## Indebtedness\n\n## Risk description\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely a/ffect our operations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had USD 20.2 billion of non-current financial debt, and USD 5.9 billion of current financial debt. Our current and long-term debt requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other capital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. We may also have di/fficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring new debt on terms that we would consider to be commercially reasonable, if at all.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Risk description\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant impairment charges\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, including most recently through our acquisitions of Gyroscope Therapeutics, The Medicines Company, Xiidra , Endocyte, Novartis Gene Therapies, and AAA. As a result, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future if\n\nthe fair value of the intangible assets and the groupings of cash-generating units containing goodwill would be less than their carrying value on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at any point in time.\n\nWe regularly review our intangible and tangible assets for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2022, for example, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of USD 1.3 billion.\n\nFor  a  detailed  discussion  of  how  we  determine whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rates\n\n## Risk description\n\nNegative e/ffect on financial results due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nChanges in exchange rates between the US dollar, our reporting currency, and other currencies can result in significant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows.\n\nIn addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that countries could take a/ffirmative steps that could significantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps could include 'quantitative easing' measures and potential withdrawals by countries from common currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial di/fficulties, including countries experiencing high inflation rates, and highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of foreign currency. Currency exchange controls and sanctions could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings from our local a/ffiliates, or to pay intercompany payables due from those countries.\n\nDespite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge against foreign currency exchange risks, as a significant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in currencies other than the US dollar, including expenditures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate volatility may negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition, and may impact the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict. Furthermore, depending on the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may be materially adversely a/ffected at a time when the same currency movements are benefiting some of our competitors.\n\nFor more information on the e/ffects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated financial statements and on how we manage currency risk, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.B Liquidity and  capital  resources-Effects  of  currency",

Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Key customers\n\n## Risk description\n\nOngoing consolidation among our distributors and retailers, and the concentration of credit risk\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nA significant portion of our global sales is made to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains and other purchasing organizations. For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately 16%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of net sales in 2022. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to 16%, 14% and 7%, respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2022. The trend has been toward further consolidation among some distributors and retailers. As a result, we may be a/ffected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. Furthermore, these customers  are  gaining  additional  purchasing  leverage, increasing the pricing pressures facing our businesses. These pressures can impact our Sandoz Division in particular, the generic products of which can often be obtained from numerous competitors. Moreover, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result of this concentration among our customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial di/fficulties, the e/ffect on us would be substantial, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to us.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of environmental liabilities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and remediate contaminated sites, including in connection with activities in the past by businesses that are no longer part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation e/fforts may take many years. While we have set aside provisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts for which we have provided in the Group\n\nconsolidated financial statements. If environmental contamination resulting from our facility operations, business activities or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including the safety of our employees and contractors, and the environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required to increase our provisions for environmental liabilities.\n\nSee also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\n## Pension plans\n\n## Risk description\n\nInaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to calculate our pension plan and other post-employment obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the discount rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide our management with historical statistical information, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates.\n\nAssumptions and estimates that we use may di/ffer materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors. Depending on events, such di/fferences could have a material e/ffect on our total equity, and may require us to make additional contributions to our pension funds.\n\nFor more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underlying actuarial assumptions, see 'Item 18.

Projects typically enter Confirmatory Development and become the responsibility of our Global Drug Development organization during Phase II testing. (For more information about our drug development program, see '-Research and development-Development program.') Projects are listed in alphabetical order by compound code, or by product name where applicable. Projects include those seeking to develop potential uses of new\n\nmolecular entities as well as potential additional indications or new formulations for already marketed products. The table below, entitled 'Projects removed from the development table since 2021,' highlights changes to the table entitled 'Selected development projects' from the previous year.\n\nThe year that each project entered the current phase of development refers to the year of the first patient's first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For projects in Phase II, the year refers to the first patient's first visit in the first Phase II trial, which can occur before the Confirmatory Development stage. Prior to 2020, we reported the current phase based on the year in which the decision to enter the phase was made. To maintain continuity, we have included certain previously disclosed projects, noted below, that have not yet achieved 'first patient, first visit' in any Phase I/hyphen.capIII study for the reported indication and route of administration. We have disclosed these projects using our previous reporting criteria.\n\nA reference to a project being in registration means that an application has been submitted to a health authority for marketing approval. Compounds and new indications in development are subject to required regulatory approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limitations. These compounds and indications are in various stages of development throughout the world. It may not be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all of the new compounds and new indications referred to in this Form/uni00A020-F in any country or in every country. See '-Regulation' for more information on the approval process.",

However, certain of our marketed products and development projects, such as cell and gene therapies, are administered only once. Net sales of the vast majority of our products are not subject to material changes in seasonal demand.\n\n## Production\n\nOur primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards, and that are produced in the most cost-e/ffective and sustainable manner. The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials.\n\nIn 2022, we began to integrate Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA), a Novartis company that focuses on radioligand therapies, into our existing manufacturing and supply structure. We manufacture our products across the following technologies at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, cell and gene therapy, RNA therapy and radioligand therapy (see also '-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment'). In our manufacturing network, we maintain state-of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our suppliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. These processes include: chemical and biological syntheses; radioisotope handling, which relates to our radioligand therapies; sterile processing, including CAR/hyphen.capT cell processing; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, develop new and innovative technologies, and review and adapt\n\nour manufacturing network to meet our needs and those of our patients and customers.\n\nWe produce raw materials for manufacturing in-house or purchase them from a number of third-party suppliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse e/ffect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards.\n\nBecause the manufacturing of our products is complex and highly regulated by governmental health authorities, supply is never guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities. We have experienced supply interruptions for our products in the past, and there can be no assurance that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. However, we have implemented a global manufacturing strategy to maximize business continuity in case of such events.\n\n## Marketing and sales\n\nThe Innovative Medicines Division serves customers with 21 564 field force representatives, as of December 31, 2022, including supervisors and administrative personnel. These trained representatives present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises certain products via digital and traditional media channels, including the internet, television, newspapers and magazines. Novartis also pursues co-promotion or co-marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other companies in various markets.",

        "page_content": "The marketplace for healthcare is evolving. Customer groups beyond prescribers have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is responding by adapting our business practices to engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated additional changes related to marketing and sales techniques in the healthcare industry. For example, many healthcare professionals have increased their use of virtual platforms when interacting with pharmaceutical companies, and prefer to receive information in a more convenient and personalized way. In response, Novartis is working to implement a new customer engagement model that combines traditional face-to-face visits with digital and other methods of engaging healthcare professionals to improve the e/fficiency and e/ffectiveness of every interaction. We are similarly changing our approach to engaging healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.\n\nAlthough specific distribution patterns vary by country, Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primarily to wholesale and retail drug distributors, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed healthcare providers. The growing number of so-called 'specialty' drugs in our portfolio has resulted in increased engagement with specialty pharmacies.\n\nIn the US, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other countries, national health services are often the only significant payer for healthcare services. In an e/ffort to control prescription drug costs, almost all managed care organizations and national health services use formularies that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care organizations and national health services also increasingly use cost-benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine whether or not to continue to reimburse existing drugs. We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products.\n\nThe trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of Innovative Medicines Division products continues in the US and internationally, both within and across countries. This has increased our customers' purchasing leverage and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers.\n\nDrug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. This issue has received significant attention in the US, especially  with  the  recent  passage  of  the  Inflation\n\nReduction Act (please see '-Price controls' for more information). At Novartis, we are increasing our e/fforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets. These include contract structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements.\n\nIn 2021, Novartis reached an agreement with the National Health Service (NHS) in England to implement a  first-of-its-kind  population  health  management approach designed to provide faster and broader access to Leqvio for certain high-risk patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  Novartis is engaging in similar collaborations with other countries.\n\nAdditionally,  following  conditional  approval  of Zolgensma in Europe in 2020, Novartis Gene Therapies established 'Day One' early access agreements in multiple European countries. These agreements support early patient access by allowing a variety of customizable options, including retroactive rebates, deferred payments, installment options, outcome-based rebates, and collaborations with healthcare systems to optimize disease management. These e/fforts have expanded globally, and we now have multiple early access agreements and  pay-for-performance  agreements  (i.e.,  outcome-based arrangements) in place in various markets around the world. Zolgensma is approved in 45 countries.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. We compete against other major international corporations that have substantial financial and other resources, as well as against smaller companies that operate regionally or nationally. Competition within the industry is intense and extends across a wide range of activities, including pricing, product characteristics, customer service, sales and marketing, and research and development.\n\nLike  other  companies  selling  patented  pharmaceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from companies selling competing patented products. Generic forms of our products may follow the expiry of intellectual property protection or regulatory exclusivities, and generic companies may also gain entry to the market through successfully challenging our intellectual property rights and exclusivities. We use appropriate, legally permissible measures to defend those rights and exclusivities. (See also '-Intellectual property' below). We also may face competition from over-the-counter (OTC) products that do not require a prescription from a physician.\n\nThere is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking to use their expertise to establish or expand their presence in healthcare, including technology companies seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of data and data management in our industry.\n\n## Research and development\n\nThe discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15/uni00A0years from the initial research to bringing a drug to market. This includes",

        "page_content": "approximately six to eight years from Phase/uni00A0I clinical trials to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a substantial risk that a compound (i.e., drug or biologic) or other therapeutic candidate will not meet the requirements to progress further. In such an event, we may be required to abandon the development of a potential therapy in which we have made a substantial investment.\n\nWe manage our research and development expenditures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether or not to proceed with development projects on a project-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the project's potential to meet a significant unmet medical need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the science underlying the project, and the potential of the project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical development) to generate significant positive financial results for the Company. Once a management decision has been made to proceed with the development of a particular molecule, the level of research and development investment required will be driven by many factors. These include the medical indications for which it is being developed, the number of indications being pursued, whether the molecule is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of development, and the level of evidence necessary to demonstrate clinical e/fficacy and safety.\n\n## Research program\n\nOur research program is conducted by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), which is the research and early development innovation engine of Novartis. NIBR is responsible for the discovery of new medicines for diseases with unmet medical need. We focus our work in areas where we believe we can have the most impact for patients. This requires the hiring and retention of highly talented employees, a focus on fundamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across di/fferent disease areas, continuous improvement in technologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, working with patients to understand their diseases and the potential benefits of therapies, close alliances with clinical and commercial colleagues, and the establishment of strategic external alliances.\n\nApproximately 5 500 full-time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals work at NIBR sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; and Emeryville, California. They contribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience; oncology; hematology; muscle disorders; ophthalmology; autoimmune diseases; and respiratory and allergic diseases. Research at the Friedrich Miescher Institute focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and the Novartis Institute for Tropical  Diseases  (NITD),  in  Emeryville,  California, focuses on discovering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis.\n\nAll drug candidates go through proof-of-concept trials to enable an early assessment of the safety and e/fficacy of the drug while collecting basic information on pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health\n\nauthorities. Following proof of concept, our Global Drug Development unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates.\n\nIn 2022, we integrated the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), which is based in San Diego, US, into NIBR. This enables closer collaboration with colleagues across NIBR and gives greater access to biological, therapeutic, and translational platforms to researchers across Novartis. The NIBR San Diego site is focused on developing novel technology to drive drug discovery research, including regenerative medicine, small interfering RNA therapy and covalent drug discovery.\n\n## Development program\n\nOur  Global  Drug  Development  (GDD)  organization oversees and executes drug development activities, working collaboratively with NIBR, our commercial organization and other parts of the Company on our overall pipeline  strategy.  The  GDD  organization  includes centralized global functions such as Regulatory A/ffairs and Global Development Operations, and global Development Units, and has approximately 12 800 full-time equivalent employees worldwide.\n\nThe traditional model of clinical development consists of three phases:\n\nPhase/uni00A0I: The first clinical trials of a new compound generally performed in a small number of healthy human volunteers - to assess the drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range. These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of its action.\n\nPhase/uni00A0II: Clinical studies performed with patients who\n\nhave the target disease, with the aim of continuing the Phase/uni00A0I safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the e/fficacy of the drug in the patient population, and determining the appropriate doses for further evaluation. Phase/uni00A0III: Large-scale clinical studies with several hundred to several thousand patients, which are conducted to establish the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in specific indications for regulatory approval. Phase/uni00A0III trials may also be used to compare a new drug against a current standard of care to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the new medicine.\n\nIn each of these phases, physicians monitor volunteer patients closely to assess the safety and e/fficacy of a potential new drug or indication.\n\nAlthough we use this traditional model, we have tailored the development process to be simpler, more flexible and more e/fficient. We divide the development process  into  two  stages:  Exploratory  Development  to establish proof of concept, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Exploratory Development consists of clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) studies, which are small clinical trials (typically involving between five and 15 patients) that combine elements of traditional Phase/uni00A0I/II testing. NIBR  conducts  these  customized  trials,  which  are designed to give early insights into issues such as safety, e/fficacy and toxicity for a drug in a given indication. Once a positive proof of concept has been established, the",

        "page_content": "drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of GDD. Confirmatory Development has elements of traditional Phase/uni00A0II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall benefit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Exploratory and Confirmatory Development may be combined and su/ffice for registration under certain conditions such as high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval.\n\nThe vast amount of data that must be collected and evaluated makes clinical testing the most time-consuming and expensive part of new drug development. The next stage in the drug development process is to seek registration for the new drug. For more information, see '-Regulation.'\n\nOur Innovation Management Board (IMB) is responsible for all strategic aspects of our development portfolio and oversees our drug development budget as well as major project phase transitions and milestones following a positive proof-of-concept outcome, including transitions to Confirmatory Development and the decision to submit a regulatory application to the health authorities. The IMB is also responsible for the endorsement of overall development strategy, the endorsement of development project priorities, and decisions on project discontinuations. Our Chief Executive O/fficer chairs the IMB, and other representatives from Novartis senior management, with expertise spanning multiple fields, are among its core and extended membership.\n\n## Alliances and acquisitions\n\nOur Innovative Medicines Division enters into business development agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products and access new markets. We license products that complement our current product line and are appropriate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in the future. We review products and compounds we are considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use for our own internally discovered drugs.\n\nIn February 2022, Novartis completed the acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings Plc. Through the acquisition, Novartis added PPY988 (GT005), an investigational one-time gene therapy for geographic atrophy, to its portfolio.\n\nFor more information about recent business acquisitions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe international pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Regulatory authorities around the world administer numerous laws and regulations regarding the testing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and marketing of drugs, and review the safety and e/fficacy of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on the non-clinical and clinical development of pharmaceutical products. These regulatory requirements, and the implementation of them by local health authorities around the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product, and the amount of time and expense associated with that development.\n\nHealth authorities, including those in the US and the EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such authorization or registration must subsequently be maintained. In recent years, the registration process has required increased testing and documentation for the approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.\n\nTo register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, e/fficacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. In every country, the submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to market the product will be granted. Although the criteria for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in most countries, the formal structure of the necessary registration documents and the specific requirements, including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a drug is registered and marketed in one country, the registration authority in another country may request additional information from the pharmaceutical company prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug may be approved for di/fferent indications in di/fferent countries.\n\nThe registration process generally takes between six months and several years, depending on the country, the quality of the data submitted, the e/fficiency of the registration authority's procedures, and the nature of the product. Many countries provide for accelerated processing of registration applications for innovative products of particular therapeutic interest. In recent years, the US and the EU have made e/fforts to harmonize registration requirements in order to achieve shorter development and registration times for medical products. However, the requirement in many countries to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement levels with government regulators and other payers can substantially extend the time until a product may finally be available to patients.\n\nThe following provides a summary of the regulatory processes in the principal markets served by Innovative Medicines Division a/ffiliates:",

        "page_content": "## United States\n\nIn the US, applications for drug registration are submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for marketing of pharmaceutical products intended for commercialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical development and registration process is typically intensive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, the company may file/uni00A0a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the scientific information that has been gathered about the compound. This typically includes information regarding the clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug's clinical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) must be filed for new indications and dosage forms for a previously approved drug.\n\nOnce an application is submitted, the FDA assigns reviewers from its sta/ff, including experts in biopharmaceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/ toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these content experts provide written evaluations of the NDA or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and are used by senior FDA sta/ff in its final evaluation of the NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then provides to the NDA or BLA's sponsor an approval, or a 'complete response' letter if the NDA or BLA application is not approved. If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The sponsor must then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure.\n\nOnce the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including any cases of adverse reactions. For some medications, the FDA requires additional post-approval studies (Phase/uni00A0IV) to evaluate long-term e/ffects or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions.\n\nThroughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA requires compliance with standards relating to good laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the manner in which we may promote our products.\n\n## European Union\n\nIn the EU, there are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in more than one EU member state at the same time: the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to obtain a national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. The procedure used for first authorization must continue to be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indication for a licensed product.\n\nUnder the centralized procedure, applications are made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the European Union (all member states). The centralized procedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered  medicines;  and  orphan  medicines (medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and medicines for which authorization would be in the interest of public health. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, the company may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then receives and validates the application, and the specialized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints a rapporteur and co-rapporteur to review it. They use experts from their countries to carry out the assessment but can also draw on expertise from other member states ('multinational teams'). The entire review cycle must be completed within 210/uni00A0days, although there are 'clock stops' to allow the company to respond to questions set forth in the rapporteur and co-rapporteur's assessment report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the company's complete response is received by the EMA. If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clarification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to justify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non-approval of the application, and their opinion is transferred to the EC. The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60/uni00A0days, on average, after a positive CHMP recommendation.\n\nUnder both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference member state (RMS) which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authorization in the RMS, which is then recognized by the concerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the application  is  done  simultaneously  in  the  RMS  and  all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120/uni00A0days. Within an additional 90/uni00A0days, the concerned member states review the application and can issue objections or requests for additional information. On Day 90, each concerned member state must be assured that the product is safe and e/ffective, and that it will cause no undue risks to the public health. Once an agreement has been reached, each member state grants national marketing authorizations for the product.\n\nAfter receiving the marketing authorizations, the company must submit periodic safety reports to the relevant health authority (EMA for the centralized procedure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addition, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented",

For some medications, post-approval studies (Phase/uni00A0IV) may be imposed to complement available data with additional data to evaluate longterm e/ffects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or PASS) or to gather additional e/fficacy data (called a Post-Approval E/fficacy Study, or PAES).\n\nEuropean marketing authorizations have an initial duration of five years. The holder of the marketing authorization must actively apply for its renewal after this first five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the competent authority performs a full benefit-risk review of the product. Should the authority conclude that the benefit-risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing authorization  can  be  suspended  or  revoked.  Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless it is determined that the product must be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing authorization automatically lapses. Any marketing authorization that is not followed within three years of its granting by the actual placing on the market of the corresponding medicinal product ceases to be valid.\n\n## Price controls\n\nIn most of the markets where we operate, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Due to increasing political pressure and governmental budget constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain robust - and potentially even strengthened - and to have a continued negative influence on the prices we are able to charge for our products.\n\n## Direct governmental e/fforts to control prices\n\nUnited States:  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the 'Act') was signed into law, which mandates the negotiation of eligible Medicare Part B and Part D drugs; redesigns the Medicare Part D benefit, including a USD 2 000 out-of-pocket  cap  for  Medicare  beneficiaries;  and imposes penalties for Medicare drugs that increase in price faster than the rate of inflation. Under the Act, the US government is required to negotiate the Medicare prices of single-sourced small molecule drugs that have been on the market for seven years following FDA approval as well as single-sourced biologics that have been on the market for 11 years after FDA approval.\n\nMedicare drugs with the highest total cost to the US government will be selected for negotiation once they become eligible. Exemptions include orphan drugs with an indication for one rare disease or condition, drugs with a total cost to the US government of less than USD/uni00A0200 million, and plasma-derived drugs.\n\nThe negotiated price will be publicly available and will become e/ffective for selected drugs nine years after FDA approval for eligible small molecules and 13 years after approval for eligible biologics. The negotiated price will be implemented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  10 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2026;\n\n- \u00b7 an additional 15 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2027;\n- \u00b7 an additional 15 eligible combined Medicare Part/uni00A0B and Part D drugs in 2028;\n- \u00b7 an additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part/uni00A0B and Part D drugs in 2029; and\n- \u00b7 an additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part/uni00A0B and Part D drugs each year after 2029\n\nNovartis will participate in the Medicare negotiation process if Novartis drugs are selected. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that choose not to participate in the negotiation process will be subject to an excise tax of up to 95% of sales.  Novartis may also be a/ffected by other provisions of the Act, such as price increase penalties for Medicare Part D drugs starting in 2022 and for Medicare Part B drugs in 2023, and rebates on eligible Medicare Part D sales starting in 2025.\n\nIn addition, by December 31, 2022, 20 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring manufacturer price transparency reporting, with eight of these states also allowing for drug a/ffordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The disclosure requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. It is expected that state legislatures will continue to focus on drug pricing in 2023 and that similar bills will be passed in more states.\n\nEurope: In Europe, our operations are subject to significant price and marketing regulations. Many governments are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member states, these include reforms to permit the reimbursed use of o/ff-label medicines, despite the presence of licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict cost-benefit assessments. In addition, prices for marketed products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individual EU member state pricing. Member states also collaborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU countries have passed legislation to impose further mandatory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or financial claw-backs on the pharmaceutical industry. The calculation of these rebates and claw-backs may lack transparency in some cases and can be di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars\n\nIn response to rising healthcare costs, most governments and private medical care providers have established reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for more expensive",

        "page_content": "brand-name pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic substitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, including many European countries, have similar laws. We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other jurisdictions are increasingly introducing laws and regulations encouraging the development of biosimilar versions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to have an impact on pricing.\n\n## Cross-border sales\n\nPrice controls in one country can have an impact in other countries as a result of cross-border sales. In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to customers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada - which has relatively stringent price controls are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Such imports from Canada and other countries into the US are currently illegal in most states. However, six US states (Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Vermont) have enacted laws allowing the import of pharmaceutical drugs from select foreign countries. The Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must certify that each state's importation plan is safe and cost-e/ffective before it can be implemented.\n\nWe expect that pressures on pricing will continue worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us to earn an adequate return on our investment in that product.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe attach great importance to intellectual property (IP) rights  -  including  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and regulatory data protection - as essential to our purpose of reimagining medicine to improve and extend people's lives, and to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. The IP system provides a means to attract the investments needed to conduct and sustainably finance innovative R&D, and to manage the risks inherent in our work. For example, we seek IP protection under applicable laws for significant product developments in major markets. Among other things, patents may cover the products themselves, including the product's active ingredient or ingredients and its formulation. Patents may cover processes for manufacturing a product, including processes for manufacturing intermediate substances used in the manufacture of the product. Patents may also cover particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a particular disease, or its dosage regimen. In addition, patents  may  cover  tests  for  certain  diseases  or\n\nbiomarkers - which can improve patient outcomes when administered with certain drugs - as well as assays, research tools and other techniques used to identify new drugs. The protection a/fforded, which may vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its duration and its scope of coverage.\n\nIn the US and other countries, the law recognizes that product development and review by the FDA and other health authorities can take an extended period, and provides an extension of patent term for a period related to the time taken for the conduct of clinical trials and for the health authority's review. However, the length of this extension and the patents to which it applies cannot be known in advance and can only be determined after the product is approved. In practice, it is not uncommon for patent term extensions (PTEs) or supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) to not fully account for the time it took to develop the product and receive marketing authorization. As a result, it is rarely the case, for example, that a 'product's active ingredient(s) will have a full patent term at the time the product is approved by the FDA and other health authorities.\n\nIn addition to patent protection, various countries provide regulatory-based protection, including regulatory data protection (RDP) and/or other market exclusivities, for a prescribed period of time. RDP is a distinct type of IP right providing exclusivity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a regulatory application that relies on the sponsor's clinical trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from approving the application for a set period of time. The RDP period can vary depending on the type of data included in the sponsor's application. When it is available, market exclusivity, unlike RDP, may preclude a competitor from obtaining marketing approval for a product even if a competitor's application relies on its own data. RDP and market exclusivity periods generally run from the date a product is approved, and so their expiration dates cannot be known with certainty until the product approval date is known and exclusivity has been granted by the relevant authorities.\n\n## United States Patents\n\nIn the US, a patent issued from an application filed today will receive a term of 20/uni00A0years from the earliest application filing date, subject to potential patent term adjustments for delays in patent issuance based upon certain delays in prosecution by the United States Patent and Trademark O/ffice (USPTO). A US pharmaceutical patent that claims a product, method of treatment using a product, or method of manufacturing a product may also be eligible for a PTE. This type of extension may only extend the patent term for a maximum of five/uni00A0years, and may not extend the patent term beyond 14/uni00A0years from regulatory approval. Only one patent may be extended for a product based on FDA review.\n\n## RDP and market exclusivity\n\nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the FDA may provide regulatory-based protection, which runs in parallel to any patent protection.\n\n- \u00b7  A new small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient receives five years of RDP, during which time a competitor generally may not obtain final approval of an",

        "page_content": "application to the FDA based on a sponsor's clinical data.\n\n- \u00b7  A  new  biologic  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug.\n- \u00b7  The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an additional six-month period of pediatric market exclusivity if the sponsor makes a timely submission of the reports of the pediatric studies in response to the FDA's Written Request. The sponsor must also have a patent-based and/or regulatory-based exclusivity period for the product to which the pediatric market exclusivity is appended.\n- \u00b7  Orphan drug exclusivity provides seven years of market exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases. During this period, a potential competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug for the same indication even if the competitor's application does not rely on data from the sponsor.\n\n## European Union Patents\n\nPatent applications in Europe may be filed in the European Patent O/ffice (EPO) or in a particular country or countries. The EPO system permits a single application to be granted for the EU plus other non-EU countries such as Switzerland, Turkey and the UK. When the EPO grants a patent, it is then validated in the countries that the patent owner designates. The term of a patent granted by the EPO or a European country o/ffice is 20/uni00A0 years from the earliest application filing date. Pharmaceutical patents can be granted a further period of exclusivity under the SPC system. SPCs are designed, in part, to account for the time taken to receive marketing authorization of a product by the European health authorities. An SPC may be granted to provide, in combination with the patent, up to 15/uni00A0years of exclusivity from the date of the first European marketing authorization. However, an SPC cannot last longer than five/uni00A0years. The SPC duration may be extended by a further six/uni00A0months if the product is the subject of an agreed and successfully  completed  pediatric  investigation  plan.  The post-grant phase of patents, including the SPC system, is currently administered on a country-by-country basis under national laws that, while di/ffering, are intended to (but do not always) have the same e/ffect.\n\n## RDP and market exclusivity\n\nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the EU provides a system of regulatory data protection for authorized human medicines that runs in parallel to any patent protection. The system for new drugs being approved today is usually referred to as '8+2+1' because it provides an initial period of eight/uni00A0years of data protection, during which a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a further period of two/uni00A0years of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used to support applications for marketing authorization but a competitive product cannot be launched; and a possible one-year extension of the market exclusivity period if, during the initial eight-year\n\ndata exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indication with 'significant clinical benefit.' This system generally applies both to national and centralized authorizations in the EU plus other non-EU countries such as the UK.\n\nThe EU also has an orphan drug exclusivity system for medicines. If a medicine is designated as an orphan drug, then it benefits from 10/uni00A0years of market exclusivity after it is authorized, during which time an application for the same or similar medicine for the same indication will not generally be accepted or granted. Under certain circumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric extension.\n\n## Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property\n\nThird parties can challenge our IP, including patents, patent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities (such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusivity), through various proceedings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the United States Patent and Trademark O/ffice (USPTO) through various proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and PostGrant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent o/ffices. The outcomes of such challenges can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nIn addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to market a generic version of one of our products by, for example, designing around our patents or marketing the generic product for non-patent-protected indications, or filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and preparing its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Also, even though we may own, co-own or in-license patents  protecting  our  products,  and  conduct  freedom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless assert that one of our products infringes a third-party patent for which we do not have a license, seeking remedies such as monetary damages or an injunction against our continued marketing of the product.\n\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that our IP rights will protect our products or that we will be able to avoid adverse e/ffects from the loss of IP protection or from third-party patents in the future.\n\n## Intellectual property protection for certain key marketed products and compounds in development\n\nWe present additional details below regarding certain IP protection for the listed Innovative Medicines Division products.

In 2022, the Sandoz Division achieved consolidated net sales of USD 9.2/uni00A0billion, representing 18.3% of the Group's total net sales. Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products including active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nSandoz is organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics, Anti-Infectives and Biopharmaceuticals. In Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets  finished  dosage  forms  of  small-molecule pharmaceuticals for sale to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, including finished dosage form anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates - mainly antibiotics - for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers. In Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- and other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars.\n\nThe Sandoz strategic ambition is to be the world's leading and most valued generics and biosimilars company . Our divisional strategy focuses on three areas: developing a broad and consistent pipeline of generic and biosimilar launches across key geographies and across a broad range of therapeutic areas; positioning Sandoz to be 'first in' by having a strong pipeline with a focus on being first to market and 'last out' by way of competitive costs and stable supply; and instilling a true 'generic mindset,' with a focus on priorities, simple and rapid decision-making, and focused resource allocation.\n\nSandoz is a global market leader in biosimilars, with a total of eight approved and marketed products, and a pipeline of over 15 molecules. In addition to internally developed projects, our biosimilar portfolio comprises\n\n## Established Brands\n\n- \u00b7 Sandostatin SC and Sandostatin LAR:\n\nSandostatin SC: There is generic competition in the US and the EU.\n\nSandostatin LAR: There is generic competition in most EU countries but no generic competition in the US.\n\n## Compounds in development\n\nWe provide certain patent information for non-marketed compounds in development that have been submitted to the FDA and/or the EMA for registration but have not yet been approved by either agency. For these products, Novartis will seek all appropriate RDP, will continue to seek additional intellectual property protection for significant product developments, and will apply for PTEs and SPCs in keeping with the great importance we attach to intellectual property.\n\n- \u00b7  VDT482 (tislelizumab). US: Patent on composition of matter (2033). EU: Patent on composition of matter (2033).\n\npublicly announced commercialization agreements with BioCon, Gan & Lee, EirGenix, Polpharma Biologics and Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd. Availability of our biosimilars varies by country.\n\nSandoz is also the global market leader in generic antibiotics. Its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site is the hub of the last fully vertically integrated penicillin production chain in Europe, which o/ffers certain competitive advantages including added supply chain resilience.\n\nIn January 2020, we closed the previously announced acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated, consisting of o/ff-patent branded medicines with a focus on anesthetics and specialty brands.\n\nIn July 2020, Sandoz and the Austrian government announced a planned combined investment of more than EUR 150 million to enhance the long-term competitiveness and supply resilience of European production for key antibiotics.\n\nIn May 2021, Sandoz confirmed details of a previously announced investment of EUR 100 million in antibiotic manufacturing technology for its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site, and announced an additional EUR 50 million investment in a new sterile production line in Palafolls, Spain. In November 2022, Sandoz announced an additional EUR 50 million investment to support increased manufacturing capacity for finished dosage form penicillin at its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site.\n\nIn October 2021, Sandoz announced that its planned acquisition of GSK's global cephalosporin antibiotics business, first announced in February 2021, had been successfully closed.\n\nOn October 1, 2021, Sandoz Inc., the US subsidiary of Sandoz, entered into a settlement agreement with the Civil Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning the department's years-long pricing investigation into the US generic drug industry.

As part of the settlement, Sandoz agreed to certain corporate integrity obligations as part of a corporate integrity agreement with the O/ffice of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which have now been implemented. The settlement contains no new factual allegations against Sandoz and, in 2020, the Group fully provisioned for this settlement and disclosed the agreement in principle as part of the March 2020 resolution. For more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\nIn August 2022, Novartis announced its intention to separate the Sandoz business to create a standalone company by way of a 100% spin-o/ff, concluding the\n\nStrategic Review announced in October 2021. The Strategic Review determined that a 100% spin-o/ff would be in the best interests of shareholders as it would create two standalone companies focused on their respective growth strategies. The new company is planned to be incorporated in Switzerland and to be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, with an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program in the US. Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including consultation with works councils and employee representatives (as required), general market conditions, tax rulings and opinions, final Board of Directors endorsement and shareholder approval in line with Swiss corporate law. The transaction is expected to be generally tax neutral to Novartis, with completion expected in the second half of 2023.\n\n## Key marketed products\n\nThe Sandoz global portfolio covers a wide range of therapeutic areas.

Sales of our anti-infective products and over-the-counter cough and cold products are subject to material changes in seasonal demand, while sales of the vast majority of our other products are not. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted seasonal variation in recent years.\n\n## Production\n\nFor information on the production of our products, see '-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative MedicinesProduction.'\n\nIn September 2020, as part of a broader reorganization of Novartis Technical Operations (NTO), we established the Sandoz Technical Operations (STO) platform within NTO. STO focuses on producing generic medicines for Sandoz, as well as related external supply operations and supply chain. In October 2021, Sandoz created a new position, Global Head, Sandoz Operations. This new, broader role, includes full operational and financial accountability for manufacturing and supply as of January 1, 2023, and was established in anticipation of the intended Sandoz 100% spin-o/ff.\n\nDue to impurities found in the active ingredient batches sourced from third-party manufacturers, we recalled Sandoz valsartan, losartan and irbesartan products in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and ranitidine film-coated tablets in the second half of 2019, from several markets, in line with our quality standards for all of our marketed products. The discovery of nitrosamines in some types of drug products led several health regulators (e.g., EMA, FDA and others) to conduct a detailed analysis of these impurities in a/ffected medicinal products. Novartis works with health authorities around the world to continuously review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines. The EMA, FDA and other health authorities have provided guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamines in medicines. The EMA review concluded in March 2021 for chemical human medicines and in July 2021 for biological human medicines. Based on guidance from health authorities, any chemical and/or biological human medicines products identified with a potential risk for nitrosamines will undergo further testing. For these\n\nproducts, we have provided initial testing and potential control strategy updates to the EMA and other health authorities. Due to constant and rapidly evolving health authority requirements, the risk assessment and related testing that we may be required to perform may increase. We will submit and communicate the final outcome of any risk assessment and related testing to the relevant health authorities within their expected time frame, and make changes to the control strategy update, if necessary.\n\nBeginning in September 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall of all finished product batches of losartan and losartan HCT products exceeding or potentially exceeding acceptable regulatory limits of the losartan azide impurity in the losartan drug substance. This impurity, which is viewed as an industrywide issue, was initially considered a mutagen that may increase the risk of cancer over time if allowed to rise above certain levels. This recall was unrelated to the nitrosamine-related recalls described above, and supply was re-established in March 2022. Since the voluntary recall, further information has been provided to the EMA by Novartis and other companies in the industry, and the EMA has concluded that the losartan azide impurity is to be classified as a non-mutagenic impurity.\n\n## Marketing and sales\n\nSandoz sells a broad portfolio of products, including the products of our Retail Generics franchise and biosimilars, to wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare outlets. Sandoz adapts its marketing and sales approach to local decision-making processes, depending on the structure of the market in each country.\n\nIn response to rising healthcare costs, many governments and private medical care providers, such as health",

        "page_content": "maintenance organizations, have instituted reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of bioequivalent generic versions of originator pharmaceutical products, such as those sold by our Retail Generics franchise. In the US, statutes have been enacted by all states that permit or require pharmacists to substitute a less expensive generic product for the brand-name version of a drug that has been prescribed to a patient. Generic use is growing in Europe, but penetration rates in many EU countries (as a percentage of volume) remain well below those in the US.\n\nRecent trends have been toward continued consolidation among distributors and retailers of Sandoz products, both in the US and internationally, which has increased our customers' purchasing leverage.\n\nLegislative or regulatory changes can have a significant impact on our business in a country. For more information on such changes, see '-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Price controls.'\n\nOur Anti-Infectives franchise supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates - mainly antibiotics - for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.\n\nOur Biopharmaceuticals franchise operates in an already mature market framework in Europe and some other markets, while the business environment is rapidly evolving in the US and many international markets. Regulatory pathways for approving biosimilar products are at various stages of maturity by market, but in some cases are still relatively new or still in development. Policies have not yet been fully defined or implemented regarding the substitution and reimbursement of biosimilars in many markets, including the US.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for generic products is characterized by increasing demand for high-quality pharmaceuticals that can be marketed at lower costs due to comparatively minimal initial research and development investments. Increasing pressure on healthcare expenditure and numerous patent and data exclusivity period expirations have encouraged more generic product launches, resulting in increased competition among the companies selling generic pharmaceutical products, leading to ongoing price pressure. In particular, Sandoz faces increased industrywide pressure on prices for generic products, particularly in the US, driven by factors including customer consolidation and growing competition from other manufacturers of generic medicines. These factors contributed to a decline in industrywide US sales that began in 2017 and continued through 2022.\n\n## Development and registration\n\nDevelopment of Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals is jointly overseen by Sandoz and GDD, and is governed by the IMB. Development and registration activities for Retail Generics products, and registration activities for Biopharmaceuticals products, are also overseen by Sandoz.\n\nBefore a generic pharmaceutical may be marketed, intensive technical and clinical development work must be performed to demonstrate, in bioavailability studies, the  bioequivalence  of  the  generic  product  to  the\n\nreference product. Nevertheless, research and development costs associated with generic pharmaceuticals are generally  much  lower  than  those  of  the  originator pharmaceuticals, as no original drug discovery, preclinical studies or clinical trials on dose finding, safety and e/fficacy are typically performed by the generics company. As a result, the di/fferent focus and lower costs of the  generic  pharmaceutical  model  ultimately  allow generic pharmaceutical products to be o/ffered at lower prices, which support and contribute to the cost containment goals of healthcare systems.\n\nWhile generic pharmaceuticals are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilar products contain a version of the active substance of an already approved biological reference medicine. Due to the inherent variability and complexity of biologic products, including batch-to-batch di/fferences and variations following manufacturing changes, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars di/ffer significantly from that of generics.\n\nThe development of a biosimilar product is much more technically challenging than the development of a typical generic small-molecule pharmaceutical. While generic pharmaceuticals normally do not require clinical studies in patients, regulators worldwide do still require such targeted studies for biosimilar products. International regulators are nonetheless increasingly discussing the potential for 'tailored development' (which refers to proposals that seek to implement a more e/fficient and expedited biosimilar development process that eliminates the current need for comparative clinical e/fficacy and safety studies of biosimilars, without any resulting compromise on quality, safety or e/fficacy) for certain molecules. Biosimilars are engineered to match the reference medicine in quality, safety and e/fficacy. This is achieved by systematically defining the target range of the reference medicine and then comparing the biosimilar to the reference medicine at various development stages to confirm biosimilarity and to establish that there are no clinically meaningful di/fferences between the proposed biosimilar and the reference biologic. Because the purpose of a biosimilar clinical development program is to confirm biosimilarity and not to establish e/fficacy and safety de novo, the clinical studies required are less than those required for a reference biologic. Therefore, the cost of development for a biosimilar is usually less than that of a reference biologic.\n\nThe development and registration sta/ff employed by a/ffiliates of the Sandoz Division are based worldwide, including at facilities in Holzkirchen, Germany; Hyderabad, India; Kundl, Austria; Ljubljana, Slovenia; and Rudolstadt, Germany. In November 2020, Sandoz completed (i) the previously announced closure of the Holzkirchen, Germany, development and registration site, with the exception of patch development and the project management group, and (ii) the closure of the product development and registration site as well as the maintenance and development regulatory centers in Unterach, Austria. We conduct an ongoing review of our global development and regulatory network to consolidate and streamline operations and optimize our network structure to enable Sandoz to compete sustainably in an increasingly challenging generics environment. In 2021, Sandoz completed the previously announced closures of its maintenance regulatory center in Barleben, Germany,  its  Fougera  development  center  located  in",

An ANDA is generally permitted to be filed four years after the initial approval of the reference product and generally cannot be fully approved by the FDA until any regulatory exclusivity of the reference product has expired. The process typically takes nearly two years from the filing of the ANDA until FDA approval. However, delays can occur if issues arise, for example, regarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study data, labeling requirements for the generic product, or qualifying the supply of active ingredients. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires a generic manufacturer to certify in certain situations that the generic product does not infringe on any current applicable patents on the product held by the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference product, or to certify that such patents are invalid. This certification often results in a patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the generics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the Hatch-Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month stay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to resolve the intellectual property issues. For generic applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing a certification claiming non-infringement or patent invalidity, the Hatch-Waxman Act generally provides those applicants  with  180/uni00A0 days  of  marketing  exclusivity, enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market their product alongside the reference product at a certain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual property issues have been resolved. However, after such point in time, the generic applicants must launch their products within certain time frames or risk losing the marketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a first-to-file applicant.\n\nIn the EU, decisions on the granting of a marketing authorization are made either by the European Commission based on a positive recommendation by the EMA under the centralized procedure, or by a single member state under the national or decentralized procedure. See '-Innovative Medicines-Regulation-European Union.' Companies  may  submit  abridged  applications  for approval of a generic medicinal product based upon its 'essential similarity' to a medicinal product authorized and marketed in the EU following the expiration of the product's data exclusivity period. In such cases, the generics company is able to submit its abridged application based on the data submitted by the innovator\n\ncompany for the reference product, without the need to conduct extensive Phase/uni00A0III clinical trials of its own. For all products that received a marketing authorization in the EU after late 2005, the abridged application can be submitted throughout the EU. However, the data submitted by the innovator company in support of its application for a marketing authorization for the reference product is generally protected for 10 years after the first grant of marketing authorization in all member states, and can be extended for an additional year if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity period, the innovator company registers a new therapeutic indication with 'significant clinical benefit.' In the case of orphan drugs, it may be extended with a two-year pediatric extension. See 'Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative MedicinesIntellectual property.'\n\n## Biosimilars\n\nThe  regulatory  pathways  for  approval  of  biosimilar medicines are still being developed and established in many countries of the world. A regulatory framework for the approval of biosimilars has been established in the EU, Japan, Canada and the US, while the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance. Sandoz has successfully registered and launched the first biosimilar (or biosimilar-type) medicine in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and many countries in Latin America and Asia. Sandoz was the first company to secure approval for and launch a biosimilar under the US biosimilar pathway that was established as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). The approval of biosimilars in Europe follows a process similar to that followed for small molecules. However, biosimilars usually have to be approved through the centralized procedure because they are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. As part of the approval process in the EU, biosimilars have to demonstrate comparability to the reference medicine in terms of safety, e/fficacy and quality through an extensive comparability exercise, based on strict guidelines set by the authorities. Regulators will only approve a biosimilar based on data that allows the regulators to conclude that there are no clinically meaningful di/fferences between the reference medicine and the biosimilar.\n\nIn the US, under the BPCIA, a biosimilar must be highly similar with no clinically meaningful di/fferences compared to the reference medicine. Approval of a biosimilar in the US requires the submission of a BLA to the FDA, including an assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics; an e/fficacy study; and possibly a pharmacodynamics study. The BLA for a biosimilar can be submitted as soon as four years after the initial approval of the reference biologic, but can only be approved 12/uni00A0 years after the initial approval of the reference biologic.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure that our products do not infringe valid intellectual property rights held by others, including taking steps to proactively challenge intellectual property rights that we believe should not have been granted.

At the same time, aging populations  are  putting  pressure  on  healthcare resources, while access to healthcare remains a challenge around the world. As a result, we see challenges and opportunities in our business environment: the need for  continuous  innovation  in  healthcare,  increasing access to medicines, the adoption of new working practices and the growing use of data science and technology. The following are some major trends currently shaping our business environment.\n\n- \u00b7 Spending on healthcare continues to grow. The need for high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever. Over the next five years, global spending on medicines is forecast to rise faster than GDP in many developed countries. The price of medicines remains a key issue as increased healthcare spending and a more uncertain economic outlook weigh on government budgets.\n- \u00b7 Aging populations are fueling a rise in chronic illness . Aging and lifestyle changes are triggering an increase in noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, causing millions of preventable deaths and putting further pressure on healthcare resources.\n- \u00b7 Medical science continues to accelerate. Scientific innovation is advancing at an unprecedented pace. In recent years, new types of treatments have been approved, including RNA therapies, gene and cell therapies, and radioligand therapies, which o/ffer targeted approaches to treating serious diseases. Because these medicines are complex, they require focused investment and expertise to bring them to reality for patients.\n- \u00b7 Access to healthcare remains a formidable challenge. Worldwide, millions of patients struggle to access the medicines they need. This may be because of cost, inequity, or structural issues in healthcare systems. While access to medicines remains an acute issue in lower-income countries, it is a problem in developed",

        "page_content": "countries too, where the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that deep health inequities remain entrenched.\n\n- \u00b7 Patients are moving to the center of healthcare. Patients are demanding more say over their treatment through patient representative groups and other means. In response, healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies are adapting, moving toward a more integrated, end-to-end approach, with an increased focus on patient engagement in drug development and other areas. At the same time, patients are becoming more important as data owners - as personal data allows more targeted treatments and supports development of new medicines.\n- \u00b7 Economic uncertainty is growing, post-COVID-19 pandemic . The global economy is facing considerable uncertainty, driven by concerns over rising energy prices and geopolitical instability. Forecasts suggest the current economic slowdown is likely to continue in 2023. In our own industry, the COVID-19 pandemic put strain on supply chains and highlighted the importance of resilient supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients  -  the  raw  materials  used  to  make  finished medicines. See 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Pricing, reimbursement and access-Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare,' and 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Macroeconomic developments-Impact of macroeconomic developments.'\n- \u00b7 Biopharma searches for more e/fficiency. At a time of growing economic uncertainty, investors are looking for sustainable growth in margins and earnings. To remain competitive, pharmaceutical companies are moving to more agile, cost-e/fficient business models, particularly as they invest to build specialized capabilities in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing. Meanwhile, rates of return on R&D are increasing for the first time in several years, largely because of emergency approvals during the COVID-19 pandemic and faster innovation cycles.\n- \u00b7 New technologies are reshaping our industry . The use of data science and technology is increasing across the industry in everything from R&D to manufacturing and marketing. This has brought greater e/fficiency, but it also requires new investment and skills. Importantly, new technologies are helping close gaps between companies, healthcare systems and patients - for example, by providing insights into the social determinants of heart health enabling the development of new prevention measures.\n- \u00b7 Working practices are changing . Working practices are changing in many countries. Demand for new skills is increasing, especially in areas such as data science. Workforces are becoming more flexible and more diverse, allowing companies to tap into new talent pools - important at a time of skills shortages in many parts of the economy.\n- \u00b7 Climate change is increasingly a/ffecting human health. Climate change could undermine decades of progress in improving human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance is also rising. At the same time, more governments are looking to decarbonize their economies over the long-term, while companies also face increased scrutiny over the sustainability of their operations and\n\nsupply chains. See 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk  factors-Climate  change-Impact  of  climate change and increased risk of major natural disasters.'\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur strategy as a focused medicines company is to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and novel access approaches.\n\nWe have made significant progress in transforming Novartis from a diversified healthcare conglomerate into a focused medicines company. In doing so, we have divested or spun o/ff non-core businesses and made targeted acquisitions to focus on our core business: discovering and developing new medicines and finding new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to execute on our strategy by putting in place a new organizational structure to support innovation, growth and productivity. We also updated our strategic priorities and announced our intention to spin-o/ff our Sandoz business, which paves the way for Novartis to advance as a company focused fully on innovative medicines. See 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Overview' and 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Sandoz.'\n\nOur strategy has clear focus areas and priorities to meet the challenges and opportunities we see in our business environment, and ensure we continue to create value for our stakeholders and society.\n\nOur focus areas determine where we invest most of our time, energy and resources and include:\n\n- \u00b7 Core therapeutic areas with high unmet patient needs: cardiovascular;  immunology;  neuroscience;  solid tumors; and hematology.\n- \u00b7 Technology platforms where we have the depth and scale to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies: Chemistry; biotherapeutics; xRNA; radioligand therapy; and gene and cell therapy.\n- \u00b7 Priority geographies which, taken together, account for the majority of the forecast growth in global healthcare spending: US, China, Germany and Japan. While these are our priority countries, we will continue to invest in other markets worldwide.\n\nOur focus areas are supported by three strategic priorities, which determine how we implement our strategy. These three strategic priorities are:\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth . Delivering new medicines for major diseases is at the core of our purpose and value creation as a company. We focus on high-value innovative medicines with the potential to transform the treatment of diseases across our five core therapeutic areas.  To do this, we seek to maximize the potential of our key in-market and launch medicines, while finding new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible and investing in R&D to deliver the next generation of high-value therapies for patients over the longer term. As part of our e/fforts, we continue our longstanding commitment to reduce the burden of infectious and tropical diseases that predominantly a/ffect underserved populations in low- and middle-income countries.",

For us,\n\nthis is about building an agile, diverse workforce and making sure we attract and retain the right talent for the future.\n\nScaling data science and technology. We are investing in data science and technology to increase e/fficiency, support innovation, better respond to the needs of patients and healthcare professionals, and ultimately improve the way we develop and deliver our medicines. Building trust with society. We aim to increase access to our medicines for underserved populations around the world and follow high standards of ethical behavior wherever we operate.",

Sales growth was driven by volume growth of 11 percentage points, mainly driven by continued strong growth from Entresto , Kesimpta , Kisqali, Pluvicto and Cosentyx . Generic competition had a negative impact of 3 percentage points, mainly due to Gilenya, Afinitor/Votubia , and Gleevec/Glivec . Pricing had a negative impact of 4 percentage points. Sales in the US were USD 17.7 billion (+5%) and in the rest of the world USD 32.8 billion (-6%, +4% cc).\n\nBy division, Innovative Medicines delivered net sales of USD/uni00A041.3 billion (-2%, +4% cc) and Sandoz net sales were USD/uni00A09.2 billion (-4%, +4% cc).\n\nIn Emerging Growth Markets, which comprise all markets excluding the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, sales to third parties were USD/uni00A013.5 billion (+2%, +9% cc) driven by China (USD/uni00A03.1 billion) growing 2% (+6% cc).\n\nOperating income was USD 9.2 billion (-21%, -13% cc), mainly due to higher restructuring costs (USD 1.2 billion) primarily related to the implementation of the previously announced streamlined organizational model, higher impairments (USD 1.0 billion), and lower divestment gains (USD 0.6 billion). Operating income margin was 18.2% of net sales, decreasing by 4.4 percentage points (-3.8 percentage points cc).\n\nNet income was USD 7.0 billion compared with USD 24.0 billion in the prior year, impacted by Roche income in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, net income declined -9% (cc). Earnings per share were\n\nUSD 3.19 compared with USD 10.71 in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, EPS declined -7% (cc).\n\nNet cash flows from operating activities amounted to USD 14.2 billion, compared with USD 15.1 billion in 2021. This decrease was mainly due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower dividends from associated companies (2021 included the USD 0.5 billion dividends received from our investment in Roche, which was divested in the fourth quarter of 2021), partly o/ffset by lower income taxes paid and favorable hedging results.\n\nFree cash flow amounted to USD 11.9 billion (-10% USD), compared with USD 13.3 billion in 2021, mainly due to a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities and lower divestment proceeds, partly o/ffset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe also present our core results 1 , which exclude the impact of amortization, impairments, disposals, acquisitions, restructurings and other significant items, to help investors understand our underlying performance.\n\nCore operating income was USD 16.7 billion (0%, +8% cc), benefiting from higher sales, partly o/ffset by higher research and development (R&D) investments. Core operating  income  margin  was  33.0%  of  net  sales, increasing by 0.9 percentage points (+1.3 percentage points cc).\n\nCore net income was USD 13.4 billion (-5%, +3% cc) as growth in core operating income was partly o/ffset by the loss of Roche core income. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core net income grew +11% (cc).",

Guidelines position Entresto as the first choice RASi versus ACEi/ARB in patients with HFrEF. Entresto benefits from the adoption of guideline directed medical therapy for these patients in all geographies. In the US, Entresto benefits from being added to guidelines for patients with HFpEF (with LVEF below normal). In China, Entresto has been listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for both HFrEF and hypertension, e/ffective January 2022. In China and Japan, Entresto volume growth is fueled by increased penetration in hypertension in addition to growth in heart failure. It is estimated that around 10 million patients are on treatment with Entresto .\n\nLeqvio (USD 0.1 billion) launch in the US and other markets is ongoing, with focus on patient on-boarding, removing access hurdles and enhancing medical education. Leqvio is the first and only small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol approved in the US and was launched in January 2022. In the US, Leqvio is covered at or near label for 76% of patients eleven months after launch. Leqvio in the US has been assigned a unique Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code (J-code) and average sales price. Leqvio is now approved in 70 countries. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.\n\n## IMMUNOLOGY\n\nSales in the Immunology therapeutic area reached USD 7.3 billion (+1%, +7% cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Cosentyx and Ilaris .\n\nCosentyx (USD 4.8 billion, +1%, +5% cc) sales grew in Emerging Growth Markets, Europe and Japan, partly o/ffset by decline in the US due to higher revenue deductions. In China, Cosentyx growth was fueled by increased biologic uptake and inclusion in approximately 1,900 hospital listings. Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has proven its sustained e/fficacy and consistent safety profile across five systemic inflammatory conditions and has treated more than 960,000 patients worldwide.\n\nXolair (USD 1.4 billion, -4%, +6% cc) sales grew (cc) in Emerging Growth Markets, Europe and Japan. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of revenue as operating income but does not record any US sales.\n\nIlaris (USD 1.1 billion, +7%, +15% cc) showed continued growth across all geographies. Contributors to growth include the adult-onset Still's disease indication, together with the other adult rheumatology indications in the US and Europe, as well as strong performance for the Periodic Fevers Syndrome indications in Japan.\n\n## NEUROSCIENCE\n\nSales in the Neuroscience therapeutic area were USD 5.1 billion (+1%, +5% cc), sales growth (cc) mainly driven by Kesimpta , which was partly o/ffset by sales decline of Gilenya .\n\nGilenya (USD  2.0  billion,  -28%,  -24%  cc)  sales declined mainly in Europe and in the US due to generic pressure.\n\nZolgensma (USD 1.4 billion, +1%, +5% cc) has been approved in 47 countries to date. As this represents most major markets, sales growth is now mainly driven by the Incident patient population where we've seen double digit growth in 2022. Access pathways are now in place in 35 countries with negotiations ongoing in additional markets.\n\nKesimpta (USD 1.1 billion, +194%, +200% cc) showed strong sales growth driven by launch momentum across all geographies. Kesimpta is a targeted B-cell therapy that can deliver powerful and sustained high e/fficacy, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and the flexibility of an at home self-administration for a broad population of RMS patients. Kesimpta is now approved in 80 countries with more than 36,000 patients treated.\n\nMayzent (USD 0.4 billion, +27%, +32% cc) sales grew across all geographies in MS patients showing signs of progression despite being on other treatments. Mayzent is the first and only oral disease-modifying therapy studied and proven to delay disease progression in a broad SPMS patient population.\n\nAimovig (USD 0.2 billion, +1%, +11% cc) sales grew in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets. Aimovig is reimbursed in 32 markets and has been prescribed to over 759,000 patients worldwide. Earlier this year, Aimovig was submitted for approval in China. In October 2022, Novartis reached an agreement in Germany by which Aimovig is reimbursed as a 1 st line prophylactic migraine treatment based on the HER/hyphen.capMES trial.\n\n## SOLID TUMORS\n\nSales in the Solid Tumors therapeutic area were USD 4.7 billion (+15%, +21% cc), sales growth mainly driven by Kisqali , Pluvicto and Tafinlar + Mekinist .\n\nTafinlar + Mekinist (USD 1.8 billion, +5%, +11% cc) sales grew across all geographies, driven by demand in BRAF+ adjuvant melanoma and NSCLC indications, while maintaining demand in the highly competitive BRAF+ metastatic melanoma market. Tafinlar + Mekinist remains the worldwide targeted therapy leader in BRAF+ melanoma. Following FDA approval in late June, Tafinlar + Mekinist is the first and only therapy with a tumor-agnostic indication for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have a BRAF V600E mutation, which drives tumor growth in more than 20 di/fferent tumor types.\n\nKisqali (USD 1.2 billion, +31%, +38% cc) sales grew strongly across all geographies, based on increasing recognition of its overall survival and quality of life benefits in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. It is a CDK4/6",

There are approximately 500 centers actively treating patients globally. In the second quarter of 2022, there was a temporary suspension in manufacturing during the quarter; production and deliveries of patient doses resumed in early June.\n\nPiqray (USD 0.4 billion, +13%, +14% cc) sales grew mainly in the US, benefiting from indication expansion into  PIK3CA-related  overgrowth  spectrum  (PROS). Piqray is the first and only therapy specifically developed for the approximately 40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who have a PIK3CA mutation, which is associated with a worse prognosis.\n\nPluvicto (USD 0.3 billion) launch is progressing well, with more than 160 active centers ordering. Pluvicto is the first and only radioligand therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have already been treated with other anticancer treatments (ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy).\n\nTabrecta (USD 0.1 billion, +48%, +48% cc) sales grew across all geographies, as the first therapy approved by the FDA to specifically target metastatic NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14).\n\n## HEMATOLOGY\n\nSales in the Hematology therapeutic area were USD 6.5 billion (0%, +7% cc), sales growth (cc) mainly driven by Promacta / Revolade , Jakavi and Scemblix .\n\nPromacta / Revolade (USD 2.1 billion, +4%, +9% cc) growth was driven by the US, Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, partly o/ffset by decline in Japan. Sales growth was driven by increased use in second-line persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as first-line and/or second-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia.\n\nTasigna (USD 1.9 billion, -7%, -1% cc) sales declined in Europe, Japan and the US, partly o/ffset by growth in Emerging Growth Markets.\n\nJakavi (USD 1.6 billion, -2%, +9% cc) sales grew (cc) in Europe, Emerging Growth Markets, Japan, driven by strong demand in both the myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications. In May, EC approved Jakavi for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with acute or chronic GvHD who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies.\n\nKymriah (USD 0.5 billion, -9%, -2% cc) sales declined in the US and Europe due to lower DLBCL demand in both geographies and was partly o/ffset by growth in Emerging Growth Markets and Japan. In May, EC and FDA approved Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients\n\nwith relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\nAdakveo (USD 0.2 billion, +18%, +19% cc) continued to grow worldwide, reaching more than 11,800 patients with vaso-occlusive crises caused by sickle cell disease to date.\n\nScemblix (USD 0.1 billion) continued its strong launch uptake in the US, with launches underway in EU and Japan, demonstrating the high unmet need in CML, particularly patients previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or with the T315I mutation. In October 2022, US FDA converted the accelerated approval of Scemblix to a full approval, confirming the clinical benefit after longer exposure.\n\n## OTHER PROMOTED BRANDS\n\nSales for Other Promoted Brands were USD 3.1 billion (-9%, -1% cc).\n\nLucentis (USD 1.9 billion, -13%, -4% cc) sales declined in Japan and Europe mainly due to competition, which was partly o/ffset by growth in Emerging Growth Markets.\n\nXiidra (USD 0.5 billion, +4%, +4% cc) sales grew mainly in the US.\n\nUltibro Group (USD 0.5 billion, -18%, -9% cc) sales declined in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets due to competition and was partly o/ffset by growth in Japan. Ultibro Group consists of Ultibro Breezhaler , Seebri Breezhaler and Onbrez Breezhaler .\n\nBeovu (USD 0.2 billion, +9%, +18% cc) sales grew in Europe, Emerging Growth Markets and Japan, partly o/ffset by decline in the US. Beovu received approval for diabetic macular edema (DME) in the EU in the first quarter of 2022, and in the US in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## ESTABLISHED BRANDS\n\nThe Established Brands had sales of USD 9.9 billion (-19%, -13% cc).\n\nSandostatin (USD 1.2 billion, -12%, -10% cc) declined across all geographies due to ongoing competitive pressure, including generic competition ex-US.\n\nGalvus Group  (USD  0.9  billion,  -21%,  -12%  cc) declined in Japan, Europe and Emerging Growth Markets.\n\nGleevec / Glivec (USD 0.7 billion, -27%, -22% cc) declined due to increased generic competition.\n\nExforge Group (USD 0.7 billion, -18%, -12% cc) declined across all geographies.\n\nDiovan Group (USD 0.7 billion, -16%, -9% cc) declined in Emerging Growth Markets, Japan and Europe.\n\nAfinitor / Votubia (USD 0.5 billion, -45%, -41% cc) declined in the US and Europe driven by generic competition.\n\nVoltaren / Cataflam (USD 0.3 billion, -10%, 0% cc) sales were stable (cc).\n\nZortress / Certican (USD 0.3 billion, -24%, -14% cc) declined in the US and Japan.\n\nExjade / Jadenu (USD 0.3 billion, -43%, -38% cc) declined due to pressure from generic competition.\n\nNeoral / Sandimmun(e) (USD 0.3 billion, -16%, -8% cc) declined across all geographies.",

This decrease was due to the divestment of our investment in Roche that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 where a gain of USD 14.6 billion was recognized.\n\n## Interest expense and other financial income and expense\n\nInterest expense amounted to USD 837 million, broadly in line with prior year.\n\nOther financial income and expense amounted to an income of USD 20 million compared to an expense of USD 80 million in the prior year, as higher interest income was partly o/ffset by financial expenses and currency losses.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe tax rate was 16.9% compared to 8.1% in the prior year period. In the prior year, the tax rate was impacted by the Roche income from associated companies (including the divestment gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Roche in December 2021), the impact of increases in uncertain tax positions and prior-year items. For comparability, excluding these impacts, the prior year tax rate would have been 16.8%, broadly in line with 16.9% in the current year.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income was USD 7.0 billion (-71%, -67% cc), impacted by Roche income in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Roche income, net income declined -9% (cc).\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share were USD 3.19 compared with USD 10.71 in the prior year, mainly due to prior year Roche income. Excluding the impact of Roche income, EPS declined -7% (cc).",

This decrease was due to the divestment of our investment in Roche that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n## Core interest expense and other financial income and expense\n\nCore interest expense amounted to USD 837 million, broadly in line with prior year.\n\nCore other financial income and expense amounted to an income of USD 141 million compared to an expense of USD 41 million in the prior year as higher interest income was only partly o/ffset by currency losses.\n\n## Core income taxes\n\nThe core tax rate (core taxes as a percentage of core income before tax) was 16.3% compared to 15.8% in the prior year. For comparability, excluding Roche Income from  associated  companies  (divested  in  December 2021), the prior year core tax rate would have been 16.7% compared to 16.3% in the current year, decreasing mainly as a result of a change in core profit mix.\n\n## Core net income\n\nCore net income was USD 13.4 billion (-5%, +3% cc) as growth in core operating income was partly o/ffset by the loss of Roche core income. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core net income grew +11% (cc).\n\n## Core earnings per share\n\nCore EPS was USD 6.12 (-3%, +6% cc), benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. Excluding the impact of Roche core income, core EPS grew +14% (cc).\n\n- 1 For an explanation of non-IFRS measures and reconciliation tables, see '-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis.'",

As part of our\n\nlong-term  strategy  to  focus  Novartis  as  a  leading medicines company, we announced and/or completed several acquisitions and divestments during 2022 and 2021.\n\nA detailed description of significant transactions in 2022 and 2021, can be found in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe Group's management has assessed the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Group's independent statutory auditor also issued an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Both the Group's management and\n\nits external auditors concluded that the Group maintained, in all material respects, e/ffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. For more details, see 'Item 15. Controls and Procedures.'\n\n## Approach to risk management\n\nSee 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item  6.C  Board  practices-Corporate  governance-Information and control systems-Risk\n\nmanagement' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis\n\nNovartis uses certain non-IFRS metrics when measuring  performance,  especially  when  measuring  current-year results against prior periods, including core results, constant currencies and free cash flow.\n\nDespite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring the Group's performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors.\n\nBecause of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS measures) may not be\n\ncomparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how the Group's management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with IFRS financials.\n\nAs an internal measure of Group performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Group's performance  management  process  is  not  solely restricted to these metrics.",

        "page_content": "## Core results\n\nThe Group's core results - including core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss, and certain acquisition- and divestment-related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD/uni00A0 25 million are also excluded: integration- and divestment-related income and expenses; divestment gains and losses; restructuring charges/releases and related items; legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and equipment, software, and financial assets, and income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD/uni00A025 million threshold.\n\nNovartis believes that investor understanding of the Group's performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance, since core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these core measures in addition to IFRS and other measures as important factors in assessing the Group's performance.\n\nThe following are examples of how these core measures are utilized:\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to monthly reports containing financial information prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these core measures.\n- \u00b7  Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS and core measures.\n\nAs an internal measure of Group performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Group's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results measures is that they provide a view of the Group's operations without including all events during a period, such as the e/ffects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments of purchased intangible assets, impairments to property, plant and equipment and restructurings and related items.\n\n## Constant currencies\n\nChanges in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can a/ffect the Group's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency e/ffects.\n\nConstant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate e/ffects so that an estimate\n\ncan be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates:\n\n- \u00b7  The impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-USD functional currencies to USD\n- \u00b7  The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency.\n\nWe calculate constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD (excluding the IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' adjustments to the local currency income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies), using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD.\n\nWe use these constant currency measures in evaluating the Group's performance, since they may assist us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also consider equivalent measures of performance that are not a/ffected by changes in the relative value of currencies.\n\n## Growth rate calculation\n\nFor ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared with the prior year is shown as a positive growth.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nNovartis defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities associated with purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of financial assets and of other non-current assets. Excluded from free cash flow are cash flows from investing activities associated with acquisitions and divestments of businesses and of interests in associated companies, purchases and sales of marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and net cash flows from financing activities.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Group's ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is available for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS.",

Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax e/ffect. Due to these factors and the di/ffering e/ffective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 7.6 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 1.2 billion. The average tax rate on the adjustments is 15.7% since the full year core tax charge of 16.3% has been applied to the pre-tax income of the period.\n- 6 Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated on the amount of net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG.",

This decrease was mainly due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower dividends from associated companies (2021 included the USD 0.5 billion dividends received from our investment in Roche, which was divested in the fourth quarter of 2021), partly o/ffset by lower income taxes paid and favorable hedging results.\n\nNet cash inflows from investing activities amounted to USD 1.5 billion, compared with USD 4.2 billion in 2021.\n\nThe current year cash inflows were driven by net proceeds of USD 4.7 billion from the sale of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; USD 0.5 billion from the sale of intangible assets, financial assets and property, plant and equipment. These cash inflows were partly o/ffset by cash outflows of USD 1.5 billion for purchases of intangible assets; USD 1.2 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; USD 0.1 billion for purchases of financial assets; and USD 0.9 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (primarily the acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc for USD 0.8 billion).\n\nIn 2021, net cash inflows from investing activities of USD 4.2 billion were driven by proceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 2.3 billion from the sale of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; and USD 1.4 billion from the sale of intangible assets, financial assets and property, plant and equipment. These cash inflows were partly o/ffset by USD 16.4 billion cash outflows for purchases of\n\nmarketable securities and time deposits, mainly due to the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 1.6 billion for purchases of intangible assets (including the upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd); USD 1.4 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; USD 0.6 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of GSK's cephalosporin antibiotics business for USD 351 million); and USD 0.2 billion for purchases of financial assets.\n\nNet  cash  outflows  used  in  financing  activities amounted to USD 20.6 billion, compared with USD 16.3 billion in 2021.\n\nThe current year cash outflows were mainly driven by USD 10.6 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 7.5 billion for the dividend payment; USD 2.5 billion in aggregate for the repayment of two US dollar bonds; and USD 0.3 billion payments of lease liabilities. These cash outflows were partly o/ffset by cash inflows of USD 0.3 billion from the net increase in current financial debts.\n\nIn 2021, net cash outflows used in financing activities of USD 16.3 billion were driven by USD 7.4 billion for the dividend payment; USD 3.0 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 3.5 billion net decrease in current financial debts; and USD 2.2 billion for the repayment of two bonds denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion and of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity. Payments of lease liabilities and other financing cash flows resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 0.2 billion.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, see '-Item 5.A Operating results-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis-Free cash flow' for further information.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the three major categories of the IFRS consolidated statements of cash flows to free cash flow:\n\n|                                                              | 2022                                                   | 2022                                                 | 2022                                                  | 2021                                                   | 2021                                                | 2021                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| (USD millions)                                               | IFRS  cash flow                                        | Adjustments                                          | Free  cash flow                                       | IFRS  cash flow                                        | Adjustments                                         | Free  cash flow                                        |\n| Net cash flows from operating activities                     | /one.tab/four.tab/space.tab/two.tab/three.tab/six.tab  |                                                      | /one.tab/four.tab/space.tab/two.tab/three.tab/six.tab | /one.tab/five.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/one.tab |                                                     | /one.tab/five.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/one.tab |\n| Net cash flows from/(used in) investing activities  /one.tab | /one.tab/space.tab/four.tab/six.tab/eight.tab          | - /three.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/five.tab/nine.tab   | - /two.tab/space.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/one.tab         | /four.tab/space.tab/two.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab         | - /five.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab   | - /one.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/eight.tab/nine.tab      |\n| Net cash flows used in financing activities  /two.tab        | - /two.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/five.tab/six.tab/two.tab | /two.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/five.tab/six.tab/two.tab | /zero.tab                                             | - /one.tab/six.tab/space.tab/two.tab/six.tab/four.tab  | /one.tab/six.tab/space.tab/two.tab/six.tab/four.tab | /zero.tab                                              |\n| Free cash flow                                               |                                                        |                                                      | /one.tab/one.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/four.tab/five.tab |                                                        |                                                     | /one.tab/three.tab/space.tab/two.tab/eight.tab/two.tab |",

adjustments.\n\nGoodwill decreased by USD 0.3 billion, mainly due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased by USD 0.8 billion, as net additions were more than o/ffset by depreciation, unfavorable currency translation adjustments and impairments.\n\nFinancial and other non-current assets decreased by USD 1.7 billion, driven by the decrease of the prepaid post-employment benefit plans of USD 0.9 billion, resulting mainly from the pension accounting e/ffects from increases in actuarial discount rates and of USD 0.6 billion from fair value losses on listed equity and fund investments.\n\nRight-of-use assets, investments in associated companies and deferred tax assets were broadly in line with December 31, 2021.\n\nTotal current assets of USD 36.9 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased by USD 8.8 billion compared to December 31, 2021.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by USD 4.9 billion, mainly due to the dividend payment, the purchase of treasury shares and net repayments of financial debt, partly o/ffset by the cash generated from operating activities and from investing activities, which includes the net proceeds from the sales of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits.\n\nMarketable securities, commodities, time deposits and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 4.5 billion mainly driven by the net sales of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits.\n\nInventories increased by USD 0.5 billion and trade receivables and other current assets and income tax receivables were broadly in line with December 31, 2021.\n\nWe consider our provisions for doubtful trade receivables to be adequate. We particularly monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an",

        "page_content": "elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic environment, historical experience, country and political risk, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are monitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these trade receivables and may require the Group to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. At December 31, 2022, amounts past due for more than one year were not significant in elevated credit risk countries.\n\nFor a table showing an overview of the aging analysis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the provision for doubtful trade receivables as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, see 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 15. Trade receivables.'\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could devalue  their  currency.  Currency  exposures  are described in more detail in '-E/ffects of currency fluctuations.'\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal non-current liabilities of USD 29.4 billion decreased by USD 4.4 billion compared to December 31, 2021.\n\nNon-current financial debts decreased by USD 2.7 billion, mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.3 billion from non-current to current financial debts of two EUR denominated bonds with notional amounts of EUR 750 million and EUR 1.25 billion maturing in 2023 and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.4 billion.\n\nProvisions and other non-current liabilities decreased by USD 1.3 billion, mainly driven by decreases in accrued liabilities for employee benefits of USD 1.2 billion (primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities for defined benefit pension plans of USD 0.9 billion, resulting from the pension accounting e/ffects from increases in actuarial discount rates), and in contingent consideration of USD 0.3 billion, a reclassification of non-current legal matters provisions to current portion of USD 0.2 billion, partly o/ffset by the increase in other non-current liabilities of USD 0.4 billion.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities decreased by USD 0.4 billion and non-current lease liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2021.\n\nTotal current liabilities of USD 28.7 billion decreased by USD 1.6 billion compared to December 31, 2021.\n\nProvisions and other current liabilities and current income tax liabilities decreased by USD 0.8 billion, mainly driven by the decrease in the commitment for repurchase of own shares liability of USD 2.8 billion, partly o/ffset by increases in restructuring provisions of USD 0.8 billion (primarily due to the initiative announced in April 2022, to implement a new streamlined organizational model), in provisions for legal matters of USD 0.5 billion, including a USD 0.2 billion reclassification from non-current provisions for legal matters, and in provisions for revenue deductions of USD 0.3 billion.\n\nCurrent financial debts and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 0.4 billion, mainly due to the repayment of two US dollar bonds of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 billion, the closure during the third quarter of 2022 of the interest-bearing accounts of employees payable on demand, which amounted to USD 1.8 billion at December 31, 2021, and favorable currency translation adjustments, partly o/ffset by the reclassification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.3 billion and an increase of USD 1.9 billion in commercial paper.\n\nTrade payables decreased by USD 0.4 billion and current lease liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2021.\n\nIn our key countries, Switzerland and the United States, assessments have been agreed by the tax authorities up to 2017 in Switzerland and up to 2014 in the United States, with the exception of one open United States position related to the 2007 tax filing. Uncertainties also exist on the application of a taxing right based on a German non-resident tax regulation for specific revenues derived from German registered intellectual property rights.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent di/fficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\n## Equity\n\nThe Group's equity decreased by USD 8.4 billion to USD 59.4 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021.\n\nThis decrease was mainly due to the cash-dividend payment of USD 7.5 billion, purchase of treasury shares of USD 10.9 billion, unfavorable currency translation differences of USD 0.5 billion and fair value adjustments on equity securities of USD 0.4 billion. This was partially o/ffset by the net income of USD 7.0 billion, decrease of the treasury share repurchase obligation of USD 2.8 billion, and equity-based compensation of USD 0.9 billion.",

Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies').\n\nIn 2022, Novartis repurchased a total of 126.2 million shares for USD 10.8 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 115.3 million shares (USD 9.9 billion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in December 2021 and 10.9 million shares (USD 0.9 billion) to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of associates. In addition, 1.4 million shares (USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 12.3 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.9 billion) were delivered as a result of option exercises and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 115.3 million versus December 31, 2021. These treasury share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 10.0 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 10.6 billion.\n\nIn 2021, Novartis repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares for USD 2.8 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 19.6 million shares (USD 1.8 billion) under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020, 8.6 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of associates and 2.5 million shares (USD 0.2\n\nbillion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in December 2021. In addition, 1.5 million shares (USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from associates. In the same period, 10.3 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.8 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of associates. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 21.9 million versus  December  31,  2020.  These  treasury  share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 2.1 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 3.0 billion.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 284.1 million shares, or approximately 12% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 99.0 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 199.5 million shares, or approximately 8% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 102.5 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use.",

As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Group's results of operations as well as the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This in turn may significantly a/ffect reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nFor purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we translate assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes of the Group's consolidated income and cash flow statements, revenue, expense and cash flow items in local currencies are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items remain unchanged in the respective local currency, changes in exchange rates have an impact on the amounts or values of these items in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause our expenditure in Swiss francs is significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility\n\nin the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural hedging a/fforded by our global business activity. In 2022 and 2021, we entered into various contracts that change in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign currency options to hedge. For more information on how these transactions a/ffect our consolidated financial statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure is managed, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 5. Interest expense and other financial income and expense,' 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 15. Trade receivables,' 'Item 18.

Non-current  financial  debts decreased by USD 2.7 billion, mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.3 billion from non-current to current financial debts of two EUR denominated bonds with notional amounts of EUR 750 million and EUR 1.25 billion maturing in 2023 and favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of USD 0.4 billion.\n\nCurrent financial debts and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 0.4 billion, mainly due to the repayment of two US dollar bonds of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 billion, the closure during the third quarter of 2022 of the interest-bearing accounts of employees payable on demand, which amounted to USD 1.8 billion at December 31, 2021, and favorable currency translation adjustments, partly o/ffset by the reclassification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.3 billion and an increase of USD 1.9 billion in commercial paper.\n\nNovartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate  of  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes. Novartis also has a Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.1 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes.

We make use of various borrowing facilities provided by several financial institutions. We also successfully issued various bonds in previous years and raised funds through our commercial paper programs.\n\nThe maturity schedule of our net debt can be found in 'Item 18.

Our divisions have numerous products in various stages of development. For further information  on  these  policies  and  these  products  in development, see 'Item 4. Information on the CompanyItem 4.B Business overview.'\n\nAs described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, our drug development e/fforts are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in any new drug development program. Due to the\n\n## 5.D Trend information\n\nPlease see '-Item 5.A Operating results', '-Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources' and 'Item 4. Information\n\non the Company-Item 4.B Business overview' for trend information.\n\n## 5.E Critical accounting estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Our significant accounting policies that are set out in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies' include a description of the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nGiven the uncertainties inherent in our business activities, we must make certain estimates and assumptions that require di/fficult, subjective and complex judgments. Because of uncertainties inherent in such judgments, actual outcomes and results may di/ffer from our assumptions and estimates, which could materially a/ffect the Group's consolidated financial statements. Application of the following accounting policies requires certain assumptions and estimates that have the potential for the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement believes that the estimation uncertainties described below did not have or are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\n## Deductions from revenues\n\nAs is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, the consideration we receive in exchange for goods and services maybe fixed or variable. The most common elements of variable consideration are primarily composed of rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers, retailers, government agencies, government supported healthcare systems, private health systems, pharmacy benefit managers,  managed  healthcare  organizations  and  other customers. Variable consideration is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. These elements of variable consideration represent estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these considerations for a reporting period.\n\nThe following summarizes the nature of some of these deductions and how the deduction is estimated. After recording these, net sales represent our best estimate of the cash that we expect to ultimately collect. The US market has the most complex arrangements related to revenue deductions.\n\n## United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates\n\nThe United States Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is administered by state governments, using state and federal funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and  needy  individuals  and  families.  Calculating  the rebates to be paid related to this program involves use of estimates and interpreting relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative\n\nrisks and uncertainties involved in progressing through preclinical development and clinical trials, and the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, among other factors, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing, completion dates and costs, or range of costs, of our drug development programs, or of the development of any particular development compound (see 'Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors'). In addition, for a description of the research and development process for the development of new drugs and our other products, and the regulatory process for their approval, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview.'",

        "page_content": "guidance by government authorities. Provisions for estimated Medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, product pricing, and the mix of contracts and specific terms in the individual state agreements.\n\nThe United States Federal Medicare Program, which funds healthcare benefits to individuals aged 65 and older, and to people with certain disabilities, provides prescription drug benefits under the Part D section of the program. This benefit is provided and administered through private prescription drug plans. Calculating the rebates to be paid related to this program involves use of estimates and interpreting relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities. Provisions for estimated Medicare Part D rebates are calculated based on the terms of individual plan agreements, product sales and population growth, product pricing, including inflation impacts, and the mix of contracts.\n\nWe o/ffer rebates to key managed healthcare and private plans in an e/ffort to ensure patient access to our products and to sustain and increase the market share of our products. These programs provide a rebate after the plans have demonstrated they have met all terms and conditions set forth in their contract with us.\n\nThese rebates and discounts, applied using provision rates, are estimated based on the specific terms in the individual states and plans agreements, historical experience, product pricing and projected product growth rates, as appropriate to the individual rebate and discount arrangements, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded.\n\nThese provisions are adjusted based on established processes and experiences from filing data with individual states and plans. There is often a time lag between recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n\n## Non-United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates\n\nIn certain countries other than the US, we provide rebates to governments and other entities. These rebates are often mandated by laws or government regulations. These rebates, applied using provision rates, are estimated based on government regulations, laws and terms of individual rebate arrangements, historical experience and other relevant factors, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience. There is often a time lag between the recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n\n## Innovative pay-for-performance arrangements\n\nWe enter into innovative pay-for-performance arrangements (i.e. outcome based arrangements) with certain healthcare providers and governments. Under these agreements, we may be required to make refunds, defer a portion of the sales price until anticipated treatment outcomes meet predefined targets, or to provide additional medicines free of charge if anticipated treatment outcomes do not meet predefined targets.\n\nThe impact of potential refunds or a deferral of a portion of the sales price are estimated and recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related sales are recorded. The impact of the future delivery of additional medicines at no cost is estimated and recorded as a contract liability at the time the related revenues are recorded. Estimates are based on historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as specific terms of the individual agreements. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not su/fficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved, until such history is available or the period of the refund right has expired.\n\nThese provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience, including the products' actual outcomes achieved compared with the anticipated predefined targets.\n\nThere is often a time lag between recording of the revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n\n## Non-healthcare plans and program rebates, returns and other deductions\n\nWe o/ffer rebates to purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase market share and to ensure patient access to our products. Since rebates are contractually agreed upon, the related provisions are estimated based on the terms of the individual agreements, historical experience and projected product sales growth rates.\n\nChargebacks occur where our subsidiaries have arrangements with indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the price charged to wholesalers. A chargeback represents the di/fference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contract price. We account for chargebacks by reducing revenue by the estimate of chargebacks attributable to a sales transaction. Provisions for estimated chargebacks are calculated using a combination of factors, such as historical experience, product growth rates, product pricing, level of inventory in the distribution channel, and the terms of individual agreements.\n\nWhen we sell a product providing a customer the right to return it, we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on our sales return policy and historical return rates. Other factors considered include actual product recalls, expected marketplace changes, the remaining shelf life of the product, and the expected entry of generic products. In 2021, sales returns amounted to approximately 1% of gross product sales. If su/fficient experience is not available, sales are only recorded based on evidence of product consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nWe enter into distribution service agreements with major wholesalers, which provide a financial disincentive for the wholesalers to purchase product quantities in excess of current customer demand. Where possible, we adjust shipping patterns for our products to maintain wholesalers' inventory levels consistent with underlying patient demand.\n\nWe o/ffer cash discounts to customers to encourage prompt payment. Cash discounts are estimated and",

        "page_content": "provisioned at the time of revenue recognition and are deducted from revenue.\n\nFollowing a decrease in the price of a product, we generally grant customers a 'shelf stock adjustment' for their existing inventory for the relevant product. Shelf stock adjustments are generally granted to customers, primarily of the Sandoz Division, to cover the inventory held by them at the time a price decline becomes e/ffective. Revenue deduction provisions for shelf stock adjustments are recorded when the price decline is anticipated, based on the impact of the price decline on the customer's estimated inventory levels.\n\nOther sales discounts, such as consumer coupons, vouchers and copay discount cards, are o/ffered in some markets. The estimated amounts of these discounts are recorded at the time of sale or when the coupons are issued, and are estimated utilizing historical experience and the specific terms for each program.\n\nIn addition, we o/ffer global patient assistance programs.\n\nWe adjust provisions for revenue deductions periodically to reflect actual experience. To evaluate the adequacy of provision balances, we use internal and external estimates of the inventory in transit, the level of inventory in the distribution and retail channels, actual claims data received, and the time lag for processing rebate claims. External data sources include reports from wholesalers and third-party market data purchased by Novartis.\n\nFor the table showing the worldwide extent of our revenue deductions provisions and related payment experiences for the Group see 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 22. Provisions and other current liabilities.'\n\n## Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nWe review intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the asset's balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets that are not yet amortized, are reviewed for impairment at least annually.\n\nAn asset is considered impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value in use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or cash generating units (CGUs), and for this purpose, management considers\n\nthe range of economic  conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Group's activities as indicated in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies.' Due to these factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the grouping of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The valuations are derived from applying discounted future cash flows based on key assumptions, including the terminal growth rate and discount rate. For additional information on impairment charges recognized and reversed by divisions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' and 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant part of our consolidated balance sheet, primarily due to acquisitions. Although no significant additional impairments are currently anticipated based on our impairment assessment and review of reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to the respective impairment assessment, future impairment evaluation could lead to material impairment charges in the future.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\nFor net impairment charges for property, plant and equipment see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 9. Property, plant and equipment.'\n\n## Retirement and other postemployment benefit plans\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the interest rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide our management with historical statistical information, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates.\n\nAssumptions and estimates used by the Group may di/ffer materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors.\n\nDepending on events, such di/fferences could have a material e/ffect on our total equity.\n\nFor more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underlying  actuarial  assumptions,  see  'Item  18.

Post-employment benefits for employees.'\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe prepare and file our tax returns based on an interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, which may result in an assessment being made, requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. Since Novartis uses its intellectual property globally to deliver goods and services, the transfer prices within the Group as well as arrangements between subsidiaries to finance research and development and other activities may be challenged by the national tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which Novartis operates. Therefore, inherent uncertainties exist in our estimates of our tax positions, but we believe that our estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including any amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are appropriate based on currently  known  facts  and  circumstances.  Uncertain (income) tax positions are periodically (re)assessed by the Company based on management's best judgment given any changes in the facts, circumstances and information available and applicable tax laws. When it is probable that the tax authorities will not accept the position taken, the Group recognizes income tax liabilities based on the most likely amount of the liability (recovery) or weighted average of various possible outcomes to reflect the e/ffect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates, to the extent that a reliable estimate can be made.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 6. Income taxes' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.'\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA number of Group companies are involved in various government investigations and legal proceedings (intellectual property, sales and marketing practices, product liability, commercial, employment and wrongful discharge, environmental claims, etc.) arising out of the normal conduct of their businesses.\n\nWe record provisions for legal proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reliably estimated. These provisions are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For significant product liability cases, the provision is actuarially determined based on factors such as past experience, amount and number of claims reported, and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported.\n\nProvisions are recorded for environmental remediation costs when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be reliably estimated.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent di/fficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Commitments and contingent liabilities.'",

        "page_content": "## 6.B Compensation\n\n## Dear shareholder,\n\nI am pleased to share with you the Novartis Compensation Report for 2022.\n\nWe believe that our compensation system supports our strategy and motivates our executives to deliver sustainable growth, successful outcomes on our financial and strategic targets, and value creation for our shareholders. Over the course of 2022, we engaged with shareholders and proxy advisors to share how our compensation system is aligned with short and long-term performance, and to secure their continued support for our compensation system design.  Based on the feedback from these interactions and the positive response to our 2021 Compensation Report, which received a 90.7% vote in favor, we will retain the current design of our executive compensation system, with small enhancements as explained later in this letter.\n\n## 2022 performance highlights\n\n2022 was a year of solid financial performance, with growth in constant currencies (cc) across sales, core profits and core margins. Sales growth drivers were Entresto (USD 4.6 billion), Kesimpta (USD 1.1 billion), Kisqali (USD 1.2 billion), Cosentyx (USD 4.8 billion), along with the Pluvicto launch. Our six in-market growth drivers with multi-billion sales potential ( Cosentyx , Entresto , Zolgensma , Kisqali , Kesimpta and Leqvio ) grew 26% (cc) in 2022, and now represent 32% of total Innovative Medicines sales, up from 26% in 2021. Overall sales were broadly in line with target.\n\nIn April 2022, we announced the introduction of a new organizational model designed to support the company's innovation, growth, and productivity ambitions as a focused medicines company. The restructuring will simplify the organization and our processes, and is expected to deliver USD 1.5 billion in savings by 2024 with a proportion of these savings already delivered in 2022, enabling us to raise our long-term core operating income margin guidance. These savings are expected to help us progress towards our aspiration of achieving ~40%+ core margin beyond 2027 and further invest in our pipeline, as a pure-play medicines company (after the planned Sandoz spin-o/ff which is subject to approval of the Novartis AG Board of Directors and shareholders). Nonetheless, there was an immediate impact on Operating Income as we incorporated related costs in the latter part of the year, that, along with higher legal settlements and unfavorable fair market value adjustments on financial assets, impacted operating income growth.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to deliver high value medicines to patients. We received 23 approvals in our key focus markets US, EU, China and Japan, including US and EU approvals for Pluvicto , a novel radioligand therapy for advanced prostate cancer. We advanced our focused pipeline of investigational medicines, with several important clinical data readouts paving the way for further launches in 2023 and beyond, a significant one being\n\niptacopan, our investigational monotherapy in the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). However, we also had disappointments as some clinical trials of experimental compounds did not meet their primary endpoints, including ACZ885 (canakinumab) in lung cancer, and UNR844 in presbyopia.\n\nWe are proud that Novartis also continued to deliver on its commitments to broaden access to medicines and tackle major global health challenges. We pledged further investment in research into malaria and neglected tropical diseases, increased access to our innovative medicines for low- and middle-income countries and formed new collaborations with governments and other partners to strengthen healthcare systems. More details on our ESG e/fforts can be found in our Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2022.\n\n## 2022 CEO compensation\n\nAs a result of the above performance, the CEO was awarded a 2022 Annual Incentive of 100%, having overall met the financial targets and strategic objectives set at the beginning of the cycle. When determining performance against the operating income metric, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to exclude restructuring costs arising from the implementation of the new organizational model and costs related to the planned Sandoz spin-o/ff, which are investments in the future of the company in terms of both sales and margin growth. These  adjustments  ensured  that  the  performance assessment was consistent with the basis on which the original targets were set.\n\nThe 2020-2022 Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) vested at 57% of target. The LTPP outcome was heavily a/ffected by the relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) performance over the period, as well as reduced sales growth during 2020 and 2021, which was substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. No adjustments were made for the COVID-19 impact, or for any other factors. (For more information, please see '-LTPP performance outcomes').\n\nDespite a solid 2022 performance, as outlined above, the CEO's 2022 total realized compensation was CHF 8/uni00A0452/uni00A0176, a decrease of 24.7% compared with prior year, driven mainly by the 2020-2022 LTPP outcome.\n\n## Changes to Executive Committee compensation system and disclosures\n\nDuring the year, we reviewed our Executive Committee compensation system, with the aim of simplification and increased transparency of our performance assessment measures and strengthening our focus on key strategic priorities, while also considering developments in compensation best practices.\n\nE/ffective the 2022-2024 cycle of the LTPP, we strengthened the assessment of research and early development performance under the Innovation metrics,",

For the innovation performance measure, the Science & Technology Committee sets targets that take into account the expected Net Present Value (eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-stage clinical development rather than the previous approach to set targets related to early-stage milestones.\n\nE/ffective from performance year 2023, we will remove 'Share of Peers' as a financial performance measure for the Annual Incentive plan, to simplify the metrics and focus on targets that provide greater transparency. The weighting of the three remaining financial measures, Group Net Sales, Group Operating Income and Group Free Cash Flow, will be 40%, 30% and 30%, respectively. In addition, we will fold division specific financial targets, where applicable, into individual strategic objectives (40% weighting) of the related Executive Committee member. All Executive Committee members will be evaluated, with a 60% weighting, against the performance of Group financial measures mentioned above.\n\nDuring the year, we announced our intention to separate our Sandoz generics and biosimilars Division into a new publicly traded standalone company, by way of a 100% spin-o/ff, subject to approval of the Novartis AG Board of Directors and shareholders.  Based on the planned completion of the spin-o/ff in 2023, the Compensation Committee made some initial decisions on the 2023 compensation elements related to the spin-o/ff.\n\nFinally, the 2023 Compensation Report will also include additional disclosures following the reform of Swiss corporate law that came into e/ffect on January 1, 2023. For more information, please see '-2023 Executive Compensation Changes'.\n\n## Inflation and cost-of-living impact on broader employee group\n\nThe Board and the Executive Committee are mindful of the cost-of-living challenges that are impacting many of our associates in di/fferent markets.  The Executive\n\nCommittee has considered these as part of its pay decisions and outcomes, and where appropriate, it has initiated local level initiatives to support associates.\n\nIn most countries, our 2023 salary budgets are higher than in previous years, reflecting the overall higher market forecasts driven by inflation. In some of our larger markets we are making a one-time payment to certain employee populations.  Where legally possible, we have tried to target these one-time payments to our lower paid employees, who are most impacted. We will continue to monitor our compensation against the Living Wage, and regularly monitor and adjust wages in hyperinflation markets to support our local associates.\n\nThese actions reflect our commitment to pay market-competitive and sustainable salaries, rather than to fully match the current volatile inflation environment.\n\n2023 base salary increases for ECN members, including the CEO, are made in line with policy, and no ECN member will receive any inflation related one-time payments.\n\n## 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on both the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM, and the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Executive Committee for the financial year 2024. Furthermore, we will request an advisory vote on this Compensation Report.\n\nWe welcome your feedback, which is invaluable in driving improvements in our compensation system and practices. On behalf of the Compensation Committee, I would like to thank you for your continued support and trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Moroney, D.Phil.\n\nChair of the Compensation Committee",

The main elements of our compensation philosophy are set out in the table below.\n\n| Pay for   performance      | \u00b7  Variable compensation is tied directly to the  achievement of strategic Company targets                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholder  alignment     | \u00b7  Our incentives are significantly weighted  toward long-term equity-based plans \u00b7  Measures under the Long-Term Incentive  plans are calibrated to promote the creation  of shareholder value \u00b7  Executive Committee members are |\n| Balanced   rewards         | \u00b7  Balanced set of measures to create  sustainable value \u00b7  Mix of targets based on financial metrics,                                                                                                                             |\n| Business   ethics          | \u00b7  The Novartis Values and Behaviors are an  integral part of our compensation system \u00b7  They underpin the assessment of overall                                                                                                   |\n| Competitive   compensation | \u00b7  Total compensation must be sufficient to  attract and retain key global talent \u00b7  Overarching emphasis on pay for  performance                                                                                                  |\n\n## Alignment with Company strategy\n\nExecutive compensation is strongly connected to business strategy. In 2022, we refocused our strategy to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in  research  and  development,  and  novel  access approaches. Our strategy focuses on five core therapeutic areas with high unmet patient needs, two core and three emerging technology platforms, and four priority geographies, which together account for the majority of expected growth in global healthcare spending.\n\n## Approach to market benchmarking\n\nThere continues to be significant competition for top executive talent with deep expertise, the requisite competencies and proven performance within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. As such, external peer compensation data is one of a number of key reference points considered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee when making decisions on executive pay, so as to help ensure that the compensation system and compensation levels at Novartis remain competitive. Novartis is committed to confirming benchmarking practices, including the peer group, to shareholders on an annual basis.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous approach to peer group construction and maintenance. Furthermore, it believes that using a consistent set of peers that is similar in size and scope enables shareholders to evaluate the compensation year on year and make pay-for-performance comparisons. In 2022, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same primary peer group of 14 global healthcare companies , as presented in the table below.\n\n## GLOBAL HEALTHCARE PEER GROUP\n\n| AbbVie          | Amgen                | AstraZeneca       |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Biogen          | Bristol-Myers Squibb | Eli Lilly & Co.   |\n| GlaxoSmithKline | Gilead Sciences      | Johnson & Johnson |\n| Novo Nordisk    | Merck & Co.          | Pfizer            |\n| Roche           | Sanofi               |                   |\n\nThe companies in this peer group reflect our industry and are similar to Novartis in terms of both size and scope of operations. Although Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, more than a third of its sales come from the US market, and the US remains a significant talent pool for the recruitment of executives by the Company. It is therefore critical that Novartis is able to attract and retain key talent globally, especially from the US.\n\nIn line with this refocused strategy, we updated our strategic priorities to target innovation power, sales growth, delivering both margin and total shareholder returns, and sector leadership in material ESG factors. The Long-Term Incentive Plan was adapted, with greater emphasis now on the delivery of high value programs in our research and early development targets. The Annual Incentive plan has been simplified e/ffective 2023, with three key financial metrics: Net Sales, weighted 40%; Operating Income, weighted 30%; and Free Cash Flow, weighted 30%.\n\nTo ensure European and local practices were fully taken into account, in 2022 the Compensation Committee  also  reviewed  a  cross-industry  peer  group  of Europe-headquartered multinational companies, selected based on comparability to Novartis in terms of industry, size, global scope of operations, and economic influence. Based on this review, the Committee retained the same group of European peers as in 2021: Anheuser-Busch InBev, AstraZeneca, Bayer, BMW, GlaxoSmithKline, L'Or\u00e9al, Merck KGaA, Nestl\u00e9, Novo Nordisk, Reckitt Benckiser, Roche, Siemens, Sanofi, and Unilever.",

This applies in cases where the payout has resulted from a\n\nviolation of laws or conflicts with internal management standards, including Company and accounting policies. This principle applies to both the short-term Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is assessing the impact of the final clawback rule in the Federal Register published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2022, and any required changes to the policy will be disclosed in the 2023 Compensation Report.",

        "page_content": "## Executive Committee performance/uni00A0management process\n\nTo foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal three-step process: objective setting, performance evaluation and compensation determination. This process is explained in the chart below.\n\nPerformance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. A rigorous framework is in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust and challenging, and align with the strategic priorities of the Group.\n\nThe key factors taken into account when setting targets include:\n\n- \u00b7  Internal and external market expectations\n- \u00b7  Novartis strategic priorities\n- \u00b7 Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries)\n- \u00b7  Investment in capital expenditure\n- \u00b7  Values and Behaviors\n\n## Objective setting\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO proposes their targets to the Board Chair; they are then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, based on input from the Compensation Committee.\n- \u00b7 For other Executive Committee members, targets for their division or unit are initially discussed with the CEO and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and challenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking.\n\nFollowing the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee discuss their individual performance evaluations and determine their individual compensation. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as performance relative to peers, wider market conditions, general industry trends and good practice are used to inform the overall performance assessment.\n\n## Compensation determination\n\n- \u00b7 A recommendation for the CEO's variable pay is made by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for final determination.\n- \u00b7 For the Long-Term Incentive financial measures' payout schedules, a formulaic approach applies, and the Compensation Committee can also exercise judgment to ensure there is appropriate alignment between payout levels and overall performance achieved. The same principle of discretion applies to the relative TSR and innovation performance measures.\n- \u00b7 The CEO's recommendations for other Executive Committee members are considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, after which the Board of Directors is notified of the outcomes.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO's performance against the individual balanced scorecard is assessed by the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 For Executive Committee members, the CEO discusses each member's performance (assessed against his or her individual balanced scorecard) with the Board Chair before making recommendations to the Board of Directors for final determination.\n- \u00b7 Periodic assessments, including at the mid-year stage, ensure progress is suitably tracked.",

This strategy will transform Novartis into a pure-play Innovative Medicines business, with multiple  in-market brands of multi-billion dollar peak sales potential, and prioritize our pipeline to focus on high-value assets  that address high disease burden and have substantial growth potential.  Sandoz separation analysis was completed with spin-off being the preferred separation path given potential future |       |\n| value upside for shareholders. Substantial progress was also made on the preparation for the planned spin-off,  which is expected to take place in the second half of 2023.

However, lower uptake for  Leqvio  resulted in sales behind target. In-market growth drivers (including  Cosentyx ,  Entresto ,  Zolgesma ,  Kisqali ,  Kesimpta , and  Leqvio ) delivered com- bined sales of USD 13.2 billion, which was slightly behind target. This was largely due to the below target perfor- mance of  Cosentyx  (total sales of USD 4.8 billion, impacted by US payer pressures, China business and Inflation  Reduction Act headwinds). This was partly offset by strong performance of  Entresto  (USD 4.6 billion) and  Kisqali (USD 1.2 billion).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Met   |\n| Innovation (15%)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |\n| In 2022, we received 23 approvals in our top four markets (US, EU, China and Japan).

This simplified and leaner organization is expected to deliver identified cost savings of approximately USD 1.5 billion by 2024, and help drive mid-term Innovative Medicines margin to the low 40s.\n\nFinancial performance for 2022 improved from prior year in constant currencies on core operating income and core margin to USD 16.7 billion and 33.0% respectively.\n\nThe Operations unit, comprising our legacy Technical Operations unit and the legacy Customer and Technology Solutions unit, achieved savings of USD 998 million against a combined target of USD 785 million. However, these savings were partially offset by external headwinds, driven mainly by inflation, of approximately USD 350 million.\n\n## Build trust with society (40%)\n\n## INNOVATION AND ACCESS\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a 26% increase in patient reach with our strategic innovative therapies, reaching 1.2 million patients, compared with the previous year (0.95 million).\n\nAll our product launches in 2022 included a tiered pricing strategy based on national income level and value-based pricing, in line with target.\n\nWith our commitment to diversity in clinical trials, 100% of our US Phase 3 studies evaluated Diversity & Inclusion principles in feasibility planning, in line with our target.\n\nThrough our Novartis Global Health flagship programs, we reached 31 million patients in 2022, beating our Sustainability-linked Bond target of 22.6 million patients by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we renewed our commitment to the research and development of new medicines for malaria and neglected tropical diseases, pledging to invest USD 250mn over five years (2021-2025), and we advanced the clinical development of next-generation malaria medicines.\n\n## PEOPLE AND CULTURE\n\nWe progressed towards a 'Performance Culture' mindset with the implementation of a new 'high support / high challenge' approach.\n\nWe remain committed in our efforts to increase workforce diversity. The percentage of women in management increased to 47%, slightly behind our target of 48%.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n\nIn 2022, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 49%, our water consumption by 42%, and our waste sent for disposal by 59%, compared with our 2016 baseline. This was broadly in line or ahead of our 50%, 41% and 50% targets, respectively.  To advance on our Scope 3 emissions target, environmental sustainability criteria have been integrated into supply contracts covering more than a third of our Scope 3 supplier emissions.\n\n## ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\nWe assessed 100% of our applicable policies & controls in the areas of Access to Medicine & Artificial Intelligence and categorized them as either 'aligned with Human Right standards' or 'needs update with defined scope to meet Human Rights standards', in line with our target.\n\n| Overall assessment of strategic objectives   | Met   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Overall assessment of CEO balanced scorecard | Met   |\n\n## ANNUAL INCENTIVE PAYOUT\n\n| Payout   | The 2022 CEO performance showed solid financial results, including sales and operating income  performance at target and most strategic objectives were achieved or exceeded.

The Science & Technology Committee determines the most important Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) milestones, weighted 30%. Effective the 20222024 LTPP cycle, NIBR targets set by the Science & Technology Committee take into account the expected Net Present Value (eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-stage clinical development.\n\nFinancial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are defined for each metric, and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0-200% against target.\n\nInnovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines the payout factor in the range of 0-150% based on the performance assessment made by the Science & Technology Committee. A payout between 150-200% of target is only delivered for truly exceptional performance.\n\nRelative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to a global healthcare peer group, as outlined below. A three-month averaging method is used for both the start and the end of the performance cycle.

with/uni00A02021\n\nThe 2022 total realized compensation for the CEO was CHF 8/uni00A0452/uni00A0176. This is a reduction of 24.7% compared with the prior year, mainly due to the lower performance payout of the 2020-2022 LTPP (57% compared with the 107% payout for the 2019-2021 LTPP). At the end of the 2020-2022 LTPP performance cycle, the rTSR ranking for Novartis, which is weighted 25% of the overall LTPP opportunity, was below median, which resulted in zero payout for this measure. Payout for Net Sales CAGR performance, also weighted 25%, was significantly lower (43% compared with 119% in 2019-2021), mainly driven by the impact of Covid-19 on Sales growth during 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, the Alcon 'keep-whole' awards, granted at the time of Alcon spin-o/ff in 2019, ended with the 20192021 LTPP payout.\n\nThe 2022 total realized compensation for the Executive Committee members, including the CEO, was CHF/uni00A049/uni00A0424/uni00A0771. This decrease of 12.7% compared with the prior year can be attributed to the same reasons mentioned above. For more detail, please refer to '-LTPP performance outcomes'.",

This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 3/uni00A0937/uni00A0537 paid in 2022 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit.\n- 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 25, 2023) of CHF 85.30 per Novartis share and USD 92.81 per ADR.\n- 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to Executive Committee members for the 2022-2024 performance cycle, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR for all members.\n- 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under 'other 2022 compensation'.\n\n5\n\nAll amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member.\n\n- 6 Shreeram Aradhye received a pro-rata LTPP award of 18 905 PSUs on June 1, 2022 (at CHF 86.18 closing share price on grant date) upon joining the organization, as per contractual entitlement.\n- 7 Victor Bulto received his 2022 LTPP grant before his appointment to Executive Committee, therefore the reported LTPP amount is pro-rated to reflect his time as Executive Committee member over the full performance cycle.\n- 8 Amounts in USD for Victor Bulto, Fiona Marshall and James Bradner were converted at a rate of CHF 1.00 = USD 1.0473, which is the average rate used in the Group's 2022 consolidated financial statements.\n- 9 Aharon Gal and Fiona Marshall did not receive a pro-rata LTPP award upon joining the organization, as they received buyout grants for their forfeited awards upon joining.\n- 10 James Bradner stepped down from the Executive Committee on October 31, 2022 and will end his notice period on October 31, 2023, in line with his contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2022 Executive Committee member departures'). The LTPP grant for the 2022-2024 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules.\n- 11 Richard Saynor left the Executive Committee on October 25, 2022. The LTPP grant for the 2022-2024 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle, subject to the plan rules. 12 Susanne Scha/ffert stepped down from the Executive Committee on April 4, 2022 and will end her notice period on April 30, 2023, in line with her contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2022 Executive Committee member departures').

The LTPP grant for the 2022-2024 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules.\n- 14 Robert Weltevreden stepped down from the Executive Committee on April 4, 2022 and will end his notice period on April 30, 2023, in line with his contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2022 Executive Committee member departures'). The LTPP grant for the 2022-2024 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules.\n\n## Compensation at grant value\n\nIn accordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies, Novartis continues to disclose total compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members. The tables below disclose the following information for the CEO and other Executive Committee members:\n\n- \u00b7  Fixed 2022 compensation (base salary and benefits)\n- \u00b7  Actual cash portion and the deferred portion granted in equity of the 2022 Annual Incentive\n- \u00b7  2022-2024 LTPP performance cycle awards, which are reported at target grant date value, based on the assumption that the awards will vest at 100% achievement, excluding any share price movement and dividend equivalents that may be accrued over the performance cycle. The future payout will be determined only after the performance cycle concludes in three years (i.e., at the end of 2024), with a payout range of 0% to 200% of the target value\n- \u00b7  Other compensation for 2022, which includes other benefits, either paid in cash or granted in equity during the year\n\nThe compensation paid, promised or granted to the members of the Executive Committee

and CHF 53/uni00A0693 for the other Executive Committee members paid by Novartis to governmental social security systems. This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 4/uni00A0966 397 paid in 2021 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit.\n- 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR.\n- 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to Executive Committee members for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and USD 96.92 per ADR for all members.\n- 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under 'other 2021 compensation'.\n- 5 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member.\n- 6 Amounts in USD for James Bradner were converted at a rate of CHF 1.00 = USD 1.0942, which is the average rate used in the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements.\n- 7 Karen Hale received a pro-rata LTPP award of 18/uni00A0639 PSUs on Apr-2, 2021 (at CHF 81.15 share price at grant) upon joining the organization, as per contractual entitlement. The other compensation amount includes the first six weeks of compensation before her appointment to the Executive Committee.\n- 8 Robert Kowalski received his 2021 LTPP grant before his appointment to Executive Committee, therefore the reported LTPP amount is pro-rated to reflect his time as Executive Committee member over the full performance cycle.\n- 9 Steven Baert left the Executive Committee on June 30, 2021 and ended his notice period on September 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and the LTPP grant for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules.\n- 10 Bertrand Bodson left the Executive Committee on January 31, 2021 and ended his notice period on November 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and no LTPP was granted for the 2021-2023 performance cycle.\n- 11 Shannon Klinger resigned as Chief Legal O/fficer as of March 15, 2021, and left the Company on May 31, 2021, in line with her reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). The 2021 Annual Incentive and LTPP 2021-2023 cycle grant (23 586 PSUs), displayed at pro-rata value for the time she was in her role in 2021, were forfeited in full upon her departure.\n\n## Compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2022 compared with 2021\n\nCompensation at grant delivered in 2022 to the CEO and the other Executive Committee members, including those who stepped down, was CHF 70/uni00A0819/uni00A0358, which was an increase of 20.7% compared with the prior year. This increase was driven mainly by the change in composition of the Executive Committee during 2022. Compensation at grant for the active Executive Committee members on December 31, 2022 (11 active members versus 12 in prior year) was CHF 49/uni00A0852/uni00A0130, which is a reduction of 3.3% from December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 Executive Committee compensation\n\n## 2023 Executive Committee compensation changes\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the compensation system supports the company's strategy and ensures a strong link between pay and performance.\n\nFollowing a positive vote of 90.6% in favor of our 2021 Compensation Report at the 2022 AGM, the Board and Compensation Committee decided to make evolutionary changes to the compensation system. The aim of these changes is to simplify and increase the transparency of our performance assessment measures, in addition to strengthening our focus on key strategic priorities, while also considering developments in compensation best practices.\n\nThere are also changes as a result of the Swiss Corporate Law reform, which came into e/ffect on January 1, 2023.\n\nAssuming that the Sandoz spin-o/ff will occur in 2023, some impact is expected on 2023 Executive Compensation.\n\n## Annual Incentive\n\nFollowing  a  review,  the  Compensation  Committee decided to adapt the financial performance in the Annual Incentive Plan e/ffective as of performance year 2023 as below:\n\n- \u00b7  Remove 'Share of Peers' from the financial performance measures in the Annual Incentive plan. As a result, the Annual Incentive financial performance measures are Group Net Sales (40%), Group Operating Income (30%) and Group Free Cash Flow 1 (30%), thereby retaining a strong link to our key priorities\n- \u00b7  Group financial measures will be weighted at 60% for all Executive Committee members. Financial targets that relate to a division or business unit, where applicable, will be part of the individual strategic objectives (40% weight)\n\n## Swiss Corporate Law reform\n\nFollowing the reform of Swiss corporate law, which came into e/ffect on January 1, 2023, the following changes will be made to compensation design and disclosure in the 2023 Compensation Report:\n\n- \u00b7  Contracts of Executive Committee members will be adapted so that any non-compete compensation will not exceed the average annual compensation of the previous three financial years\n- \u00b7 In previous years, the Swiss regulations permitted companies to award compensation of up to 40% above the shareholder approved budget for newly appointed members of the Executive Committee, whether that be through internal promotions or external hires. From 2023, this additional budget of 40% will only be made available for external appointments of Executive Committee members\n\nThese changes will require adjustments to the Articles of Incorporation of Novartis, which will be submitted to Novartis shareholders for their approval at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Sandoz spin-o/ff\n\nIn August 2022, we announced our intention to separate Sandoz, our generics and biosimilars division, into a new publicly traded standalone company, by way of a 100% spin-o/ff, subject to approval of the Novartis AG Board of Directors and shareholders. In view of the planned spino/ff, the Compensation Committee made the following decisions.\n\n## Sandoz CEO 2023 Annual Incentive\n\nBased on the assumption that the spin-o/ff will be implemented in the second half of 2023, the 2023 Balanced Scorecard for Richard Saynor, CEO designate of Sandoz, will be adapted so that his 2023 Annual Incentive will be based exclusively on the financial and strategic performance of Sandoz.\n\n## Equity Restoration principles\n\nIf and when the planned spin-o/ff occurs, holders of vested and unvested awards in the form of Novartis shares or ADRs will receive a dividend in kind resulting from the spin-o/ff in the same way as other Novartis shareholders. Holders of unvested RSUs and PSUs will not receive the dividend in kind resulting from the spino/ff. To compensate for the expected reduction in shareholder value after the issue of dividend in kind, Novartis will grant equity awards (called 'Keep Whole awards') to its employees, including the Executive Committee members, following the spin-o/ff. This will be undertaken in accordance with the Sandoz equity restoration plan, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The Keep Whole awards will have a value similar to the value of the dividend in kind resulting from the spin-o/ff that each RSU or PSU would have received had it been a Novartis share or ADR\n- \u00b7  The aim of the Keep Whole awards is to ensure that Novartis employees who have been granted RSUs or PSUs, including Executive Committee members, are not disadvantaged by the spin-o/ff relative to Novartis shareholders\n\nMore details will be shared at the time of the spin-o/ff.",

During the year, she designed the new organization structure, implementing a large restructuring program and creating new therapeutic areas with clear portfolio focus, while delivering strong commercial performance in Region International and ensuring growth above target for many key brands. E/ffective March 1, 2022, Ms. Tschudin will receive a 5% increase in annual base salary, and a 10% increase in both her Annual Incentive target and LTI target, as a percentage of annual base salary, to recognize her increased responsibilities as the Chief Commercial O/fficer.\n\nFollowing an assessment of their compensation competitiveness and performance, recently appointed Executive Committee members Victor Bulto, Aharon (Ronny) Gal, and Robert Kowalski will receive a 10-20% increase in their Annual Incentive target and/or LTI target, in line with the '-Executive Committee appointments compensation policy'. Ste/ffen Lang will also receive a 10% increase in LTI target as a result of his enhanced responsibilities in Operations.",

        "page_content": "## 2022 Board compensation\n\n## Philosophy and benchmarking\n\nAligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, including both Swiss and international members, who have global experience.\n\nGiven their focus on corporate strategy, supervision and governance, Board members do not receive variable compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total compensation of the Board of Directors until the following AGM.\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the level of compensation for its Chair and the other members to be in line with relevant benchmark companies, including other large Switzerland-based multinational companies such as ABB, Credit Suisse, Holcim, Nestl\u00e9, Roche and UBS. This peer group was chosen for Board compensation due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including broad personal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and criminal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and executive committee compensation related to the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies), and under US law (due to the Company's secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange). The Board of Directors reviews the compensation of its members, including the Board Chair, each year based on a proposal by the Compensation Committee and advice from its independent advisor, including relevant benchmarking information. To ensure independence of decision-making, the peer group used for the Board of Directors is di/fferent to that used for the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board Chair's contract and the Board of Directors compensation policy do not provide for any termination-related payments.\n\n## Board Chair\n\nAs Board Chair, Joerg Reinhardt receives total annual compensation valued at CHF 3.8 million.

Board members may choose to receive more of their compensation in shares instead of cash\n- \u00b7  At least 50% of compensation is delivered in shares in two installments: one six months after the AGM; and one 12 months after the AGM\n\nBoard members bear the full cost of their employee social security contributions, if any, and do not receive share options or pension benefits.\n\n## 2023 Board compensation\n\nIn  2022,  the  Compensation  Committee  reviewed, together with its independent advisor, the Board of Directors' compensation system against the Swiss Market Index. They found that the Board Chair fees and retainer fees of the other Board members are well positioned and competitive among the benchmarked companies in relation to the Company's size, operational complexity and corporate headquarter's location. Additional information on our Board benchmarking practices is provided in '-2022 Board compensation.' The compensation system and fee levels for the Board of Directors will therefore remain unchanged in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation governance\n\n## Legal framework\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations and the corporate governance guidelines of the SIX Swiss Exchange require listed companies to disclose certain information about the compensation of board and executive committee members, their equity participation, and loans made to them. This Annual Report fulfills that requirement in addition to being in line with the principles of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). For more details, please refer to '-Corporate Governance' in Section 6C of this Report.\n\n## Risk management principles\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with support from its independent advisor, reviews market trends in compensation, and changes in corporate governance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk management principles is outlined below.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n\n- \u00b7  Rigorous performance management process, with approval of targets and  evaluation of performance for the CEO by the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7  Balanced mix of short-term and long-term variable compensation elements\n- \u00b7  Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture\n- \u00b7  Clawback and malus principles apply to all elements of the variable compensation\n- \u00b7  Performance-vesting LongTerm Incentives only, with three-year cycles\n- \u00b7  All variable compensation is capped at 200% of target\n- \u00b7  Contractual notice period of 12/uni00A0months\n- \u00b7  Post-contractual non-compete period is limited to a maximum of 12 months from the end of employment. Resulting compensation, if applicable, will not exceed the average annual compensation (annual base salary plus Annual Incentive) of the previous three financial years\n- \u00b7  Good and bad leaver provisions apply to variable compensation of leavers\n- \u00b7  No severance payments or change-of-control clauses\n- \u00b7  Share ownership requirements; no hedging or pledging of Novartis share ownership\n- \u00b7  No loans granted to current or former members of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors or to 'persons closely linked' to them\n\n## Compensation decision-making authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation is governed by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/ investors/company-overview/corporate-governance. The Compensation Committee serves as the supervisory and governing body for compensation policies and plans within Novartis, and has overall responsibility for determining, reviewing and proposing compensation policies and plans for approval by the Board of Directors in\n\nline with the Compensation Committee Charter. The discussions and conclusions of each committee meeting are delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compensation decision-making authorities is set out below.\n\n## Compensation authorization levels within the parameters set by the shareholders' meeting\n\n## DECISION ON\n\n## DECISION/hyphen.capMAKING AUTHORITY\n\n| Compensation of Board Chair and   other Board members   | Board of Directors     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Compensation of CEO                                     | Board of Directors     |\n| Compensation of other Executive   Committee members     | Compensation Committee |\n\n## Committee member independence\n\nThe Compensation Committee is composed exclusively of members of the Board of Directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the Board Regulations. From the 2022 AGM, the Compensation Committee consisted of the following four members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), Patrice Bula, Bridgette Heller, and William Winters.\n\n## Role of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor\n\nThe independent external compensation advisor supports the committee in determining the design and implementation of compensation and benefits.\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  retained  Mercer Limited, which was appointed in July 2017, as its independent external advisor until June 2022. As part of its normal governance practices, and with a view to ensuring the independence of the advisor, the Compensation Committee considered a change in the Committee advisor. To inform this decision, it conducted a market review of compensation advisors, with a focus on companies with extensive experience in European and US markets. Following a tendering process and an analysis to ensure that there were no conflicts of interest, the Compensation Committee appointed Mitul Shah of Deloitte AG as its independent compensation advisor with e/ffect from July 2022. The independent advisors from Mercer Limited and Deloitte AG and their respective teams that advised and supported the committee are not responsible or rewarded for work beyond support provided to the Compensation Committee and the People & Organization function on senior compensation.\n\n## Meetings held in 2022 and self-evaluation\n\nIn 2022, the Compensation Committee held seven formal meetings. In line with prior years, it collaborated with the Science & Technology Committee to review and endorse, for approval by the Board of Directors, the innovation targets and achievements of the Annual Incentive and LTPP. The Compensation Committee conducted a self-evaluation in 2022.",

The audit was limited to the information on compensation, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies Limited by Shares (Verordnung gegen \u00fcberm\u00e4ssige Verg\u00fctungen bei b\u00f6rsenkotierten  Aktiengesellschaften,  Veg\u00fcV)  namely  the tables '2022 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members' on pages 105-106, '2022 compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members' on pages 108-109, 'Additional disclosures for the CEO and other Executive Committee members' on pages 110-113, as well as the '2022 Board compensation' on page 117118 and the 'Additional disclosures' on page 120 of the Compensation Report of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2022, hereinafter referred to as 'disclosures made on the pages defined as subject to audit'.\n\nIn our opinion, the information on compensation, loans and advances in the enclosed Compensation Report defined as subject to audit complies with Swiss law and Art. 14-16 Veg\u00fcV.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA/hyphen.capCH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe Compensation Report of the Company for the year ended December  31,  2021  was  audited  by  another  auditor  who expressed an unmodified opinion on this Report on February 1, 2022.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables and disclosures in the Compensation Report mentioned in the 'Opinion' paragraph of this report, the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Compensation Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Compensation Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Compensation Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Compensation Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is\n\nnecessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information on compensation, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 Veg\u00fcV is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA/hyphen.capCH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Compensation Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA/hyphen.capCH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Richard Broadbelt\n\nLicensed Audit Expert Auditor in charge\n\nBasel, January 31, 2023\n\nNorman Dittes\n\nLicensed Audit Expert",

In 2022, Novartis integrated the Pharmaceuticals and Oncology business units under the IM Division and created two separate commercial organizations with a stronger geographic focus - Innovative Medicines International and Innovative Medicines US. IM is supported by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) and Global Drug Development (GDD). Both operating divisions are supported by Novartis Operations (which combines the former Novartis Technical Operations (NTO) and Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS) units), and corporate functions. The latter includes the newly created Strategy & Growth function, which combines corporate strategy, R&D portfolio strategy and business development.

We also held virtual roadshows in 2022 as part of our engagement with North American, European and Asian investors.\n\n## Voting rights, restrictions and representation\n\n## REGISTRATION\n\nShareholders have the right to vote and to execute all other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nEach share registered with the right to vote by the third business day before the General Meeting entitles the holder to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with voting rights, a shareholder must declare that he or she acquired the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Register is an internal, non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 2% of the share capital. Given that shareholder representation at General Meetings has traditionally been comparatively low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registration restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered shareholders listed in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholdersShareholders-Significant shareholders.' Exemptions also apply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participation, Basel, which as of December 31, 2022, was registered in the Share Register with less than 2% of the share capital, and to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2022, was not registered but held 2.3% according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions were requested in 2022. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses",

Exemptions are in force for the nominees listed in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholders-Shareholders-Significant shareholders,' and for the nominee Citibank, London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of December 31, 2022, was not registered in the Share Register. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nAccording to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees who are linked to each other or who act in concert to circumvent registration restrictions are treated as one person or nominee for the purposes of the restrictions on registration.\n\nThe registration restrictions may be changed by resolution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## ATTENDANCE, REPRESENTATION AND ONLINE PLATFORM\n\nRegistered shareholders will receive personal invitations to the General Meetings along with a registration/ proxy form as well as a personal one-time password and a QR code to log in to our online platform. By  returning the registration/proxy form or using the online platform, shareholders are able to order an admission card for the General Meeting or appoint another shareholder or the Independent Proxy to vote their shares on their behalf.\n\nIf the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders can also give voting instructions on alternative or additional motions related to the agenda items either (i) following the recommendations of the Board for such alternative or additional motions, or (ii) opposing such alternative or additional motions. They can also abstain from voting.\n\nShareholders choosing not to receive the comprehensive invitation materials will be informed of upcoming General Meetings through a letter containing the login credentials to access the online platform as well as a reference to www.novartis.com/investors/shareholder-information/general-meetings, where all relevant information is available.\n\nIn accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as in the previous year, physical attendance at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) was not possible, and shareholders could exercise their voting rights exclusively through the Independent Proxy.\n\n## ADR HOLDERS\n\nADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit agreement (such as the right to give voting instructions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of Novartis AG - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exercise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder.\n\n## General Meeting\n\n## CONVENING\n\nThe AGM must be held within six months after the end of our financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late February/early March. Extraordinary General Meetings may be requested by the Board, the external auditor, or shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital.\n\n## AGENDA\n\nShareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal.\n\n## POWERS\n\nAccording to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance), the following powers are vested exclusively in the General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n- \u00b7  Approval of the management report and the consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7  Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and the decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, including dividends\n- \u00b7  Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved by the AGM is not su/fficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members, Novartis may use up to 40% of the amount last approved for the newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members.\n- \u00b7  Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles of Incorporation (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n\n## STATUTORY QUORUMS\n\nThe General Meeting passes resolutions and elections with the absolute majority of the votes represented at the meeting. However, under article 18 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance), the approval of two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting is required for:\n\n- \u00b7  Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Creation of shares with increased voting powers\n- \u00b7  Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restrictions\n- \u00b7  Authorized or conditional increase of the share capital\n- \u00b7  Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights\n- \u00b7  Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights\n- \u00b7  Change of the registered o/ffice of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Dissolution of Novartis AG\n\nIn addition, the law provides for a qualified majority for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger.",

Ann Fudge, Board member since 2008, and Enrico Vanni, Board member and Vice-Chair since 2011 and Lead Independent Director since 2021, did not stand for re-election at the 2022 AGM. The biographies of Ms. Fudge and Mr. Vanni can be found in the 2021 Annual Report (pages 130 and 133), available at www.novartis.com/news/media-library/novartis-annual-report-2021.\n\n## Election and term of o/ffice\n\nBoard members (including the Board Chair) and Compensation Committee members are elected individually by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year term of o/ffice. The term of o/ffice expires at the end of the next AGM.\n\nAccording to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, a member shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. Under special circumstances and if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance).\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Board Chair, supported by the GSNC, ensures e/ffective succession plans for the Board, the CEO and the Executive Committee. These plans are discussed by the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board member is launched - normally with the support of a professional executive search company - with individual selection criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the Company and a continuing focus on diversity. The set of competencies (further explained in 'Item 6.C Board practices-Board of Directors-Board skills') and a balance between continuity of experience and fresh perspectives are also important criteria for the GSNC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are interviewed by the Board Chair, members of the GSNC, other Board members, and members of the Executive Committee. The GSNC then makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM.\n\nThe Board will propose to the shareholders a new candidate for election at the 2023 AGM. Andreas von Planta already announced in 2021 that he will not stand for re-election at the 2023 AGM.\n\nThe term limit supports our commitment to renew the Board on an ongoing basis and also follows international best practice. We believe age is still a  relevant factor in Board composition, and the GSNC will consider this and other factors - including gender, nationality and ethnicity - when evaluating candidates and exploring ways to increase Board diversity.\n\n- D.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.A Operating results-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis'). The IFRS and core figures are compared with the prior-year period and targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis.\n- \u00b7  Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share on a USD basis\n\nManagement information related to the consolidated income statements and free cash flow is made available to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, which includes an analysis of key deviations from the prior year or target.\n\nPrior to the release of each quarter's results, the Board receives the actual consolidated financial statement information and an outlook of the full-year results in accordance with IFRS and core results (as defined by Novartis), together with related commentary.\n\nAnnually, in the middle of the year, the Board approves the Company's strategic plan for the next three years. In the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the operating targets for the following year as well as the financial targets for the following three-year period, including a projected consolidated income statement in USD prepared in accordance with IFRS and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis (core results).\n\nThe Board does not have direct access to the Novartis financial and management reporting systems but can, at any time, request more detailed information.",

Furthermore, our Internal Audit function provides an independent evaluation of risk management (see '-Item 6.C Board practices-Information and control systems-Internal Audit').\n\n## BOARD COMMITTEES\n\n## RISK COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Oversees the risk management system and processes\n- \u00b7  Reviews, together with management, the prioritization and handling of risks, the risk portfolio, and actions implemented by management\n- \u00b7  Performs deep dives into key risk areas and fosters a culture of smart risk-taking\n- \u00b7  Receives updates on cyber security on an annual basis\n- \u00b7  Receives regular updates from designated risk owners as well as the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer and/or the Head of Risk & Resilience\n\n## AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Ensures that Internal Audit plans are aligned with key risks, and that the function provides independent assurance and insights around these risks\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to minimize gaps in risk coverage\n- \u00b7  Receives a semiannual presentation from the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n- \u00b7  Receives a quarterly presentation from the Chief Audit O/fficer on progress achieved in implementing the risk-based audit plan, and key insights about audit and advisory activities\n- \u00b7  Pays particular attention to financial risk\n- \u00b7  Has closed sessions with the Chief Audit O/fficer and, upon request, with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n\n## COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to ensure that the compensation system does not lead to excessive risk-taking (see '-Item 6.B Compensation-Compensation governanceRisk management principles')\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF NOVARTIS\n\n- \u00b7  Regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics\n\n## ETHICS, RISK & COMPLIANCE\n\n- \u00b7  Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics\n- \u00b7  Provides an integrated ERM framework (further described in the following section)\n- \u00b7  Governs the global compliance program within Novartis\n- \u00b7  Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal Controls framework\n\n## SENIOR LEADERS OF DIVISIONS, ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND/uni00A0GROUP FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS\n\n- \u00b7  Provide appropriate risk management within their area of responsibility\n- \u00b7  Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing resources for possible actions\n- \u00b7  Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the ERM process\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management framework\n\nThe Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer, the Risk & Resilience team is responsible for the overall ERM process. This process covers, but is not limited to, risks associated with:\n\n- \u00b7  The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products\n- \u00b7  Finance, taxes, intellectual property, compliance with law and regulations, security, product safety, human resources, and health, safety and environmental protection\n- \u00b7  Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions\n- \u00b7  External factors such as the social, political and economic environment\n\nThe ERM process continued to evolve in 2022. The Risk & Resilience team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop at the leadership team level. In parallel, risk workshops were held in the top 11 countries (by revenue) and in certain focus markets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an e/ffective way. The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.\n\nIn 2022, we further matured our ERM framework within the Novartis Risk & Resilience organization, developed additional risk management trainings, and integrated other critical risk management functions (like Third-Party Risk Management and Health, Safety and Environment) into the Risk & Resilience department. Furthermore, the Enterprise Policy & Internal Control team is progressing as planned to create a holistic framework, and the Central Monitoring Coordination team is expanding its scope to ensure a harmonized and coordinated monitoring process across the Company.\n\n## SpeakUp O/ffice\n\nOur SpeakUp O/ffice provides a safe place for employees to report potential misconduct, including the option to do so anonymously.\n\n## Global Security\n\nGlobal Security proactively collects and shares threat intelligence to protect Novartis from situations that may compromise the safety of people, products and assets, and/or the reputation of our organization. Global Security protects patients from counterfeit products and, as part of the SpeakUp process, performs fair and timely investigations into high-risk cases of alleged internal misconduct. It also provides personal security advice and support for Novartis executives and other employees with the utmost discretion.",

The Chief Audit O/fficer meets with the ACC at least once a quarter and confirms the organizational independence of the Internal Audit function to the ACC on an annual basis.\n\nIn 2022, our Internal Audit function executed a riskbased audit plan and reported the results to the audited units, the Executive Committee and the ACC. Audit findings and action plans are stored and monitored in a single location to enable e/fficient and e/ffective follow-up. The following outlines the number of audits, internal reviews and advisories performed in 2022, and key methodology steps when managing the Internal Audit cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAUDITS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n41\n\nINTERNAL REVIEWS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n14\n\nADVISORIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal Audit cycle methodology includes:\n\n- 3 Planning: Monitoring and information gathering via continuous risk assessment based on data analytics, business interviews and quarterly calibration of the audit plan\n- 3 Execution and Reporting: 63 engagements delivered in 2022, all linked to group risks, emerging topics and company-wide initiatives\n- 3 Follow Up: Management is responsible for resolving issues, supported by Internal Audit to ensure timely closure of observations\n\n8\n\nInternal Audit performed 85% of planned activities (equating to 63 of 74 engagements) in 2022, conducted under a hybrid model of engagement delivery, choosing between remote and in-person auditing based on the engagement scope and COVID-19 situation within the audited entity.",

        "page_content": "## Auditors\n\n## Duration of the mandate and/uni00A0terms/uni00A0of/uni00A0o/ffice\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent auditor for election at the AGM. KPMG commenced its auditing mandate for Novartis in 2022. Richard Broadbelt, Auditor in charge, and Sara Burke, Global Audit Partner, began serving in their roles in 2022. The ACC together with KPMG will ensure that these partners are rotated at least every five years.\n\n## Auditing fees and additional fees\n\nThe ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This policy is designed to help ensure that the independence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of services that the external auditor may provide to the Group, stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and non-audit services, including tax services and other services that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe external auditor is required to report periodically to the ACC about the scope of the services it has provided to the Group and the fees for the services it has performed to date. KPMG fees for professional services related to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022, and PwC fees for professional services related to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021, are as follows:\n\n|                        |   2022 USD million |   2021 USD million |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Audit services         |               22.5 |               22.2 |\n| Audit-related services |                0.7 |                1.5 |\n| Tax services           |                1.2 |                0.1 |\n| Other services         |                0   |                1.4 |\n| Total                  |               24.4 |               25.2 |\n\nAudit services include work performed to issue opinions on consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions related to the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on local statutory financial statements. Also included are audit services that generally can only be provided by the statutory auditor, such as the audit of the Compensation Report, audits of the adoption of new accounting policies, audits of information systems and the related control environment, as well as reviews of quarterly financial results.\n\nAudit-related services include other assurance services provided by the independent auditor but not restricted to those that can only be provided by the statutory auditor. They include services such as: audits of pension and other employee benefit plans; audits in connection with non-recurring transactions; contract audits of third-party arrangements; corporate responsibility assurance; and other audit-related services.\n\nTax services include tax compliance, assistance with historical tax matters, and other tax-related services.\n\nOther services in 2021 included procedures related to corporate integrity agreements, benchmarking studies, and license fees for use of accounting and other reporting guidance databases.\n\n## Information to the Board and the ACC\n\nThe ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2022, this committee held seven meetings. KPMG was invited to all of these meetings to attend the discussions on auditing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit.\n\nThe ACC recommended to the Board to approve the audited consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial statements of Novartis/uni00A0AG for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Board proposed the acceptance of these financial statements for approval by the shareholders at the next AGM.\n\nThe ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the external auditor and, based on this, once a year determines whether the external auditor should be proposed to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the performance of the external auditor, the ACC requests input from management and holds private meetings with the CFO and the Chief Audit O/fficer and, if necessary, obtains an independent external assessment. Criteria applied for the performance assessment of the external auditor include an evaluation of: its technical and operational competence; its independence and objectivity; the sufficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to probe and challenge; its ability to provide e/ffective, practical recommendations; and the openness and e/ffectiveness of its communications and coordination with the ACC, the Internal Audit function and management.\n\nOnce a year, the Auditor in charge and the Global Audit Partner report to the Board on the external auditor's activities during the current year, and on the audit plan for the coming year.\n\nOn an annual basis, the external auditor provides the ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the committee and the external auditor discuss the external auditor's independence from Novartis.",

As of December/uni00A031, 2022, Novartis had approximately 186 000 shareholders listed in the Share Register of Novartis, representing approximately 67.0% of issued shares. Based on the Novartis Share Register and excluding treasury shares, approximately 48.4% of the shares registered by name were held in Switzerland, and approximately 21.3% were held in the US. Approximately 15.6% of the shares registered in the Share Register were held by individual investors, while approximately 37.7% were held by legal entities (excluding 7.7% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries), and 46.7% were held by nominees, fiduciaries and the ADS depositary. Due to a change in Swiss corporate law, as of January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held by certain Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis (Foundation Shares) no longer carry the right to vote. As a result, in the future these Foundation Shares will be excluded from the calculation of the shares registered\n\nin the Share Register in the same way, as described above, that our treasury shares are excluded. This will impact some of the percentage holdings reported in this Item 7.A in future Form 20-F filings by Novartis.\n\nBased on the Share Register, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. There are no arrangements that may result in a change of control.\n\nThe tables below set forth information with respect to our major shareholders according to the Share Register as of December 31, 2022, excluding 7.7% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries. The following registered shareholders (including nominees and the ADS depositary) held more than 2% of the total share capital of Novartis with the right to vote all their Novartis shares based on an exemption granted by the Board of Directors:\n\n|                                                          |

If approved by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our shares before the ex-dividend date and holds the shares until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are reflected in our financial statements in the year in which they are approved by our shareholders.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay a growing annual dividend in Swiss francs per share. This policy is subject to our financial conditions and outlook at the time, the results of our operations, and other factors.\n\nThe Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.20 per share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on March 7, 2023. Because we pay dividends in Swiss francs, exchange rate fluctuations will a/ffect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs.

Financial StatementsNote 18-Equity.'\n\n## Disclosure pursuant to Section/uni00A0219 of the Iran Threat Reduction/uni00A0and Syria Human Rights Act (ITRA)\n\nAt Novartis, our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives, regardless of where they live. This includes the compliant sale of medicines and other healthcare products worldwide. To help us fulfill this mission, we have for many years maintained two representative o/ffices located in Iran.\n\nAs of October/uni00A018, 2010, a non-US a/ffiliate within our Innovative Medicines Division entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, the Iranian Ministry of Health acknowledges certain benefits that may apply to sales of certain Innovative Medicines Division medicines by third-party distributors in Iran. These include  fast-track  registration,  market  exclusivity, end-user subsidies, and exemptions from customs tari/ffs. Novartis receives no payments from the Iranian Ministry of Health under the MoU, and the MoU creates no\n\nobligations on the part of either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2022, non-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions made payments to government entities in Iran related to patents, trademarks, exit fees and other transactions ordinarily incident to travel by doctors and other medical professionals resident in Iran to attend conferences or other events outside Iran.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2022, non-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions enter into agreements with hospitals, research institutes, medical associations and universities in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other healthcare professionals for consulting  services,  including  participation  in  advisory boards  and  investigator  services  for  observational (non-interventional)  studies.  Some  hospitals  and research institutes are owned or controlled by the government of Iran, and some doctors and healthcare professionals are employed by hospitals that may be public or government-owned.\n\nBecause our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions have operations in Iran, including employees, they obtain services and have other dealings incidental to their activities in that country, including paying taxes and salaries either directly or indirectly through a service provider, and obtaining o/ffice rentals, insurance, electricity, water and telecommunications services, o/ffice and similar supplies, and customs-related services from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled by the government of Iran. In addition, from time to time, representatives of our non-US a/ffiliates participate in meetings with Iranian o/fficials to discuss issues relevant to our business and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nNon-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions maintain local accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). These non-US a/ffiliates make local transactions for employee payroll and local vendor payment purposes. These transactions are conducted for the purpose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line with the humanitarian exceptions contained in Section 11 of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian financial institution designated on the SDN List in connection with Iran's support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",

Additional Information\n\n## 10.A Share capital\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.B Memorandum and articles of association\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation ('Articles'); our Regulations of the Board, the Board Committees and the Executive Committee ('Board Regulations'); and Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations ('Swiss CO'), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an exhibit to this Form/uni00A020-F, and to Swiss law.\n\n## 10.B.1 Company purpose\n\nNovartis AG is registered in the commercial register of the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland, under number CHE-103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in Article/uni00A02 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, information technology or related areas. We may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sustainable value.\n\n## 10.B.2 Directors\n\nAccording  to  our  Articles,  the  Board  of  Directors ('Board') consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the Board Chair) are elected individually by the General Meeting of Shareholders ('General Meeting') for a oneyear term of o/ffice lasting until completion of the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ('AGM').\n\n- (a)  A Board resolution requires the a/ffirmative majority of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, a member of our Board ('Director') may not participate in decisions and resolutions on matters that a/ffect, or reasonably might a/ffect, the Director's interests or the interests of a person close to the Director.\n- (b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the approval of the aggregate amounts of such compensation by a shareholders' resolution under the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Public Companies of the Swiss Federal Council.\n- (d)  The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, under certain circumstances and if deemed in the best interests of the Company, recommend exceptions to this rule to the General Meeting.\n- (e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at the time of the election by the General Meeting. However, according to our share ownership guidelines, the Board Chair is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five years after joining the Board, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders.\n\n## 10.B.3 Shareholder rights\n\nBecause Novartis AG has only one class of registered shares, the following information applies to all shareholders.\n\n- (a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out of  balance  sheet  profits  or  out  of  distributable reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may only pay dividends upon shareholders' approval at a General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires us to accrue general legal reserves under certain circumstances so long as these reserves amount to less than 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our Board expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board Practices-Capital Structure-Limitation on  transferability-Per-share  information'  and 'Item/uni00A0 8./uni00A0 Financial Information-Item/uni00A0 8.A. Consolidated statements and other financial informationDividend policy.'\n- (c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits to Directors.\n\nDividends are usually due and payable shortly after the shareholders have passed a resolution approving the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date revert to us and are allocated to our general reserves. For information about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties from dividend payments, see '-Item/uni00A010.E Taxation.'",

        "page_content": "- (b) Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meeting. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares registered with the right to vote on the record date for the applicable General Meeting. In order to do so, the shareholder must file/uni00A0a share registration form with us, setting forth the shareholder's name, address and citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its registered o/ffice). If the shareholder has not timely registered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote at, or participate in, a General Meeting.\n\nTo vote its shares, the shareholder must also explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may not be voted unless the Board recognizes such shareholder as a nominee.\n\nThe Articles provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 2% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Furthermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses, and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past granted exemptions from the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees.\n\nFor purposes of the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees, groups of companies and groups of shareholders acting in concert are considered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of subscription, option or conversion rights.\n\nAfter hearing the registered shareholder or nominee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive e/ffect as of the date of registration, the registration of the shareholders if the registration was e/ffected based on false information.\n\nRegistration restrictions in the Articles may only be removed upon a resolution carrying a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at a General Meeting.\n\nExcept as noted below, shareholders' resolutions require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, abstentions have the e/ffect of votes against such resolutions. Some examples of shareholders' resolutions requiring a vote by such 'absolute majority of the votes' are:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n- \u00b7 Approval of the management report and of the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, including dividends, if any\n- \u00b7 Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM)\n- \u00b7  Discharge  of  Board  and  Executive  Committee members from liability for matters disclosed to the General Meeting\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n\nAccording to the Articles and Swiss law, the following matters require the approval of a 'supermajority' of at least two-thirds of the votes present at a General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Creation of shares with increased voting powers\n- \u00b7  Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restrictions\n- \u00b7 Authorized or conditional increase of the share capital\n- \u00b7  Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights\n- \u00b7  Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights\n- \u00b7  Change of the registered o/ffice of Novartis/uni00A0AG\n- \u00b7  Dissolution of Novartis AG\n\nIn addition, the law provides for a qualified majority for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger.\n\nOur shareholders are required to annually elect all Directors (including the Board Chair), the Compensation Committee members, the external auditor and the Independent Proxy. The Articles do not provide for cumulative voting of shares.\n\nAt a General Meeting, shareholders can be represented by a proxy, which must either be the shareholder's legal representative, another shareholder with the right to vote, or the Independent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered by the chair of the meeting. ADSs, each representing one Novartis AG share and evidenced by ADRs, are issued by our depositary JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, and not by us. The ADR is vested with rights defined and enumerated in the Deposit Agreement (such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a certain number of",

        "page_content": "ADRs). The enumeration of rights, including any limitations on those rights in the Deposit Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to the ADR holders. Only the ADS depositary, holding our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a Novartis AG share and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder.\n\nThe Deposit Agreement between our depositary, the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the voting rights attached to the registered shares underlying the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG shares (i.e., the right to vote up to 2% of the Novartis AG  registered  share  capital  -  unless  otherwise granted an exemption by the Board - and the disclosure requirement for nominees).\n\n- (c) Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit shown on our balance sheet and to distribute dividends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject to the legal requirements described in 'Item/uni00A010.B.3(a) Shareholder rights.'\n- (d) Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liquidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to the paid-in nominal value of their shares.\n- (e) The Swiss CO limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if we have su/fficient freely disposable equity in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. However, it is accepted that a Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares beyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addition, we are required to recognize a negative position, or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repurchased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting, but are entitled to the economic benefits generally connected with the shares. The definition of subsidiaries, and therefore, treasury shares, for purposes of the above-described reserves requirement and voting restrictions, di/ffers from the definition of subsidiaries for purposes of consolidation in our consolidated financial statements. The definition in the consolidated financial statements requires consolidation for financial reporting purposes of special purpose entities in instances where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as\n\nto obtain benefits from its activities. Therefore, our consolidated financial statements include special purpose entities, mainly foundations, which do not qualify as subsidiaries subject to the reserve requirements and voting restrictions of the Swiss CO because we do not hold a majority participation in these special purpose entities. Accordingly, no reserve requirements apply to shares held by such special purpose entities, and such entities are not restricted from independently voting their shares.\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury shares without the approval of a capital reduction by our shareholders.\n\n- (f)  Not applicable.\n- (g) Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to make  further  contributions  with  respect  to  their shares.\n- (h) See '-Item/uni00A0 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' and 'Item/uni00A010.B.7 Change in control.'\n\n## 10.B.4 Changes to shareholder rights\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares without the prior approval of a capital increase by our shareholders. If a capital increase is approved, then our shareholders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions on the transfer of registered shares without the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of votes. In addition, see '-Item/uni00A010.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' with regard to the Board's ability to cancel the registration of shares under limited circumstances.\n\n## 10.B.5 Shareholder meetings\n\nUnder the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested by shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital, specifying the items for the agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF/uni00A01/uni00A0000/uni00A0000 may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. A General Meeting is convened by publishing a notice  in  the  Swiss  O/fficial  Gazette  of  Commerce (Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt) at least 20/uni00A0days prior to such meeting. Shareholders may also be informed by mail. Neither the Swiss CO nor the Articles require a quorum for a General Meeting. In addition, see 'Item/uni00A010.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' regarding conditions for exercising a shareholder's right to vote at a General Meeting.",

The statements of US and Swiss tax laws set forth below are based on the laws and regulations in force as of the date of this 20-F - including the current Convention Between the US and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, entered into force on December/uni00A019, 1997 ('the Treaty'); the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('the Code'); Treasury regulations; rulings; judicial decisions; and administrative pronouncements - and may be subject to any changes in US and Swiss law, and in any double taxation convention or treaty between the US and Switzerland occurring after that date, which changes may have retroactive e/ffect.\n\n## Swiss taxation\n\n## Swiss residents\n\nWithholding Tax on dividends and distributions. Dividends that we pay and similar cash or in-kind distributions that we may make to a holder of shares or ADRs (including distributions of liquidation proceeds in excess of the nominal value, stock dividends and, under certain circumstances, proceeds from repurchases of shares by us in excess of the nominal value) are generally subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax ('the Withholding Tax') at a current rate of 35%. Under certain circumstances, distributions out of capital contribution reserves made by shareholders after December/uni00A031, 1996, are exempt from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly report the gross distribution received on their personal tax return or in their financial statements for tax purposes, as the case may be.\n\nIncome tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who receives dividends and similar distributions (including stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or ADRs is required to include such amounts in the shareholder's  personal  income  tax  return.  However,\n\ndistributions out of qualified capital contribution reserves are not subject to income tax. A corporate shareholder may claim substantial relief from taxation of dividends and similar distributions received if the shares held represent a fair market value of at least CHF/uni00A01/uni00A0million.\n\nCapital gains tax upon disposal of shares. Under current Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be characterized as taxable dividend income if certain conditions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident individual as part of the shareholder's business property are, in general, included in the taxable income of such person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal Tax of December/uni00A014, 1990, and several cantonal laws on direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss corporate entities holding more than 10% of our voting stock for more than one year.\n\n## Residents of other countries\n\nRecipients of dividends and similar distributions on our shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax purposes nor holding shares as part of a business conducted through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland ('Non-Resident Holders') are not subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the disposal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes.\n\nNon-Resident Holders of shares are, however, subject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar distributions mentioned above and, under certain circumstances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such Non-Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund of the Withholding Tax if the country in which they reside has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland. Non-Resident Holders should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty refunds (and the time frame required for obtaining a refund) may di/ffer from country to country. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding receipt, ownership, purchase, sale or other dispositions of shares or ADRs, and the procedures for claiming a refund of the Withholding Tax.",

Tax treaty negotiations between Switzerland and some of the countries listed in the immediately preceding sentence have been ongoing for an extended period of time, and we are not certain when or if such negotiations will be completed, and when or if the corresponding treaties will come into e/ffect.\n\nA Non-Resident Holder of shares or ADRs will not be liable for any Swiss taxes other than the Withholding Tax described above and, if the transfer occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, the Stamp Duty described below. If, however, the shares or ADRs of Non-Resident Holders can be attributed to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained by such person within Switzerland during the relevant tax year, the shares or ADRs may be subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of income and gains realized on the shares or ADRs, and such person may qualify for a full refund of the Withholding Tax based on Swiss tax law.\n\nResidents of the US. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 15% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i)/uni00A0qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (ii)/uni00A0is not a company (or, if it is a company, such company directly holds less than 10% of our voting stock), and (iii)/uni00A0does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15% Treaty rate. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced\n\nrate of tax on dividends equal to 5% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i)/uni00A0is a company, (ii)/uni00A0qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (iii)/uni00A0holds directly at least 10% of our voting stock, and (iv)/uni00A0does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 5% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed on Swiss Tax Form/uni00A082 (82C for corporations; 82I for individuals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address below, together with an instruction form.

In addition to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nThe following is a general discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because this discussion does not consider any specific circumstances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. In particular, additional or di/fferent rules may apply to US expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regulated investment companies; traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; dealers in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities; insurance companies; broker-dealers; investors liable for alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction; holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This discussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for investment purposes), and whose functional currency is the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for benefits under the Treaty.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i)/uni00A0an individual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes; (ii)/uni00A0a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii)/uni00A0an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv)/uni00A0a trust (i)/uni00A0subject to the primary supervision of a US court and\n\nthe control of one or more US persons, or (ii)/uni00A0that has a valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of the owning and disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see the discussion below under '-Dividends' regarding certain statements made by the US Treasury concerning depositary arrangements.\n\nThis discussion assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nDividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the dividend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. For this purpose, a 'dividend' will include any distribution paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under US federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a US Holder's tax basis in the shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, which will be long-term capital gain if the US Holder held our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders.\n\nDividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs will constitute income from sources outside the US for US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders generally may claim as a credit against their US federal income tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the Withholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax credits, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor.\n\nThe US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions",

        "page_content": "inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the creditability of the Withholding Tax could be a/ffected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.\n\nIn general, a US Holder will be required to determine the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, including the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder generally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any foreign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.\n\nFor a non-corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a 3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualified dividends paid to them, as applicable.\n\ngenerally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the di/fference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US Holder's tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs exceeds one year. In the case of a non-corporate US Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In addition, the gains could be subject to a 3.8% investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nUS information reporting and backup withholding. Dividend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares or ADRs received in the United States or through US-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting and backup withholding requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any US Holders required to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form/uni00A0W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n\nSale or other taxable disposition.

This annual contribution payment will equal: (a)(1) USD 1.7/uni00A0million less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees and expenses (including,  without  limitation,  any  central  securities depository fees, charges and expenses) incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items in (a)(2) collectively are the 'Custody Costs') plus (b)/uni00A070% of the gross\n\nissuance and cancellation fees collected by JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such Contract Year minus (c)/uni00A0that portion (if any) of JPMorgan's legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in excess of USD 50 000 for such Contract Year. To the extent that the Custody Costs for a Contract Year exceed USD 1.7/uni00A0million, these costs would be capped at USD 1.7/uni00A0million.\n\nJPMorgan has further agreed to waive the USD 0.05 per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by Novartis in connection with our deposits of shares as part of our employee stock ownership and employee participation plans. Novartis is responsible for reimbursing JPMorgan  for  all  taxes  and  governmental  charges required to have been withheld and/or paid, and not so withheld and/or paid, arising from such waived fees.",

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nNovartis AG's Chief Executive O/fficer and Chief Financial O/fficer, after evaluating the e/ffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule/uni00A013a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were e/ffective.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management of the Group are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Group's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Group's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ffective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nGroup management assessed the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December/uni00A031, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December/uni00A031, 2022, the Group's internal control over financial reporting is e/ffective based on those criteria.\n\nKPMG AG, Switzerland, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report under 'Item/uni00A018. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm.'\n\nSee the report of KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, included under 'Item/uni00A018. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm.'\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially a/ffected, or are reasonably likely to materially a/ffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nHarry Kirsch Chief Financial O/fficer\n\nBasel, January 31, 2023",

The following summarizes some significant ways in which our corporate governance practices di/ffer from those followed by domestic listed US companies under the listing standards of the NYSE:\n\n- \u00b7  Novartis  AG  shareholders  do  not  receive  written reports directly from Board committees.\n- \u00b7 External auditors are appointed by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), as opposed to being appointed by the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n- \u00b7  While shareholders cannot vote on all equity compensation plans, they are entitled to hold separate, yearly binding votes on Board and Executive Committee compensation.\n- \u00b7  The Board has set up a separate Risk Committee that oversees the risk management system and processes, as opposed to delegating this responsibility to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n- \u00b7  The  full  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the performance evaluation of the Board and Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7  The full Board is responsible for setting objectives relevant to the CEO's compensation and for evaluating his performance.",

Significant accounting policies\n\nThe Novartis Group (Novartis or Group) is a multinational group of companies specializing in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of innovative pharmaceuticals and cost-saving generic medicines. The Group is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe Group's financial year-end is December 31, which is also the annual closing date of the individual entities' financial statements incorporated into the Group's consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts.\n\nEstimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. Actual outcomes and results could di/ffer from those estimates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nListed below are accounting policies of significance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS provides alternatives, the option adopted by Novartis.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include all entities, including structured entities, over which Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control (generally as a result of owning more than 50% of the entity's voting interest). Consolidated entities are also referred to as 'subsidiaries.'\n\nIn cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsidiary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net identified assets.\n\nInvestments  in  associated  companies  (generally defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds between 20% and 50% of voting shares or over which it otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, except for selected venture fund investments for which the Group has elected to apply the method of fair value through the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Novartis are presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that respective entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are primarily denominated in this currency.\n\nFor subsidiaries not operating in hyperinflationary economies, the subsidiary's results, financial position and cash flows that do not have USD as their functional currency are translated into USD using the following exchange rates:\n\n- \u00b7  Income, expense and cash flows for each month using the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values for each month being aggregated during the year\n- \u00b7  Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates\n- \u00b7  Resulting exchange rate di/fferences are recognized in other comprehensive income\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies, the impact of the restatement of the non-monetary assets and liabilities with the general price index at the beginning of the period is recorded in retained earnings in equity. The subsequent gains or losses resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale or held for distribution to owners\n\nNon-current assets are accounted for as assets held for sale or as related to discontinued operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction or distribution to owners and a sale or distribution to owners is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and any resulting impairment is recognized. Assets related to discontinued operations and assets of a disposal group held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. The prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated.\n\nIf in a subsequent period, the criteria for classification as held for sale are no longer met, the recoverable amount of assets and liabilities are reclassified out of assets held for sale into the respective balance sheet lines and the prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated. The cumulative amount of depreciation and amortization not recorded since the date of their classification  as  assets  held  for  sale,  and  any  required",

Expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore the site when it is no longer used are included in their cost.\n\nAcquired businesses are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless the optional concentration test is applied. The optional concentration test allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis to account for the acquired business as an asset separately acquired when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nThe acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Group obtains control. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research  and  development  activities,  probability  of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The section '-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the estimated useful life of the individual asset. Freehold land is not depreciated. The related depreciation expense is included in the costs of the functions using the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the  balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections over the useful life.\n\nThe following table shows the estimated useful life by major categories for property, plant and equipment:\n\n|                                                 | Useful life                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                       | /two.tab/zero.tab to /four.tab/zero.tab years |\n| Machinery and other equipment                   |                                               |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Machinery and equipment | /seven.tab to /two.tab/zero.tab years         |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Furniture and vehicles  | /five.tab to /one.tab/zero.tab years          |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Computer hardware       | /three.tab to /seven.tab years                |\n\nGovernment grants obtained for construction activities, including any related equipment, are deducted from the gross  acquisition cost to arrive at the balance sheet carrying value of the related assets.\n\n## Leases and right-of-use assets\n\nAs lessee, at inception and upon the modification of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract contains a lease. The Group elected to allocate the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments as from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term. The lease term includes the period of any lease extension that management assess as reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the Novartis incremental borrowing rate for the asset subject to the lease in the relevant market.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever there is a change to the lease terms or expected payments under the lease, or a modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease.\n\nThe portion of the lease payments attributable to the repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows used in financing activities, and the portion attributable to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially recognized on the balance sheet at cost, which comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received, and any initial direct costs incurred by Novartis, and expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove right-of-use assets when they are no longer used.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over",

Leases that transfer substantially all of the risk and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the counterparty (the lessee) are accounted for as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease payments received are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated income statement in 'Other income.'\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. It is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs), that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, and which are usually represented by the reported segments. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of these groups  of  CGUs,  and  any  impairment  charges  are recorded under 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Intangible assets available for use\n\nNovartis has the following classes of available for use intangible assets: currently marketed products; technologies and other intangible assets (including software).\n\nCurrently marketed products represent the composite value of acquired intellectual property (IP), patents, distribution rights and product trade names.\n\nTechnologies represent identified and separable acquired know-how used in the research, development and production processes.\n\nSignificant investments in internally developed and acquired computer software are capitalized and included in the 'Other' category, and amortized once available for use.\n\nIntangible assets available for use with a definite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are evaluated for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe following table shows the estimated useful life by major categories for intangible assets available for use and the line in the  consolidated income statement\n\nin which the amortization and any potential impairment charge is recognized:\n\n|                             | Useful life    | Income statement line for amortization and impairment charges   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Currently marketed products | 5 to 20 years  | 'Cost of goods sold'                                            |\n| Technologies                | 10 to 20 years | 'Cost of goods sold'  or 'Research  and development'            |\n| Other (including  software) | 3 to 12 years  | In the relevant  functional expense                             |\n\n## Intangible assets not yet available for use\n\nAcquired research and development intangible assets that have not yet obtained marketing approval are recognized  as  in-process  research  and  development (IPR&D).\n\nIPR&D is not amortized, but is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances warrant. Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under 'Research and development.' Once a project included in IPR&D has received marketing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred to the 'Currently marketed  products' category.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAn asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered impaired  when  its  balance  sheet  carrying  amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value-in-use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. These valuations are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Group's activities with regard to:",

For goodwill, Novartis generally utilizes cash flow projections for a three-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods.\n\nProbability-weighted scenarios are  typically used. Discount rates used consider the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset.\n\nDue to the above factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts are presented within current financial debts on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Marketable securities, commodities and non-current financial assets\n\nCommodities, which include gold bullion or coins, are valued at the lower of cost or fair value using current market prices. The changes in fair value below cost are immediately recorded in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nMarketable securities are financial assets held for short-term purposes which are principally traded in liquid markets and are classified within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in 'Other financial  income  and  expense'  in  the  consolidated income statement. Non-current financial assets held for long-term  strategic  purposes  are  classified  within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets\n\nare recorded in 'Other income' and 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nMarketable  securities  and  non-current  financial assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is di/fferent from the settlement date when the transaction is ultimately e/ffected. Quoted securities are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based on current market prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active or no market is available, fair values are established using valuation techniques. The majority of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair value through the purchase price established between a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are subsequently adjusted based on values derived from discounted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. These investment values are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Group classifies and accounts for its marketable securities and non-current financial assets in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7  Debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into the consolidated income statement, as they meet both the 'solely payment of principal and interest' and the business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are recognized in the consolidated income statement when the debt instrument is sold, at which time the gain is transferred to 'Other financial income and expense.' Exchange gains and losses related to debt instruments are immediately recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n- \u00b7  Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other income' for gains and 'Other expense' for losses.\n- \u00b7  Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are reclassified to retained earnings when the equity security is sold. If these equity securities are not designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as described above.\n- \u00b7  Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and long-term receivables from customers, advances and other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which reflects the time value of money less any allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt securities valued at fair value through other comprehensive",

        "page_content": "income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nFor other financial assets valued at amortized cost, impairments, which are based on their expected credit losses, and exchange rate losses are included in 'Other expense'  in  the  consolidated  income  statement. Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the e/ffective interest rate method, are included in 'Other income' or 'Other financial income' in the consolidated income statement, depending on the nature of the item.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to their current fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow model, using interest rate curves and forward rates at the reporting date as observable inputs.\n\nOptions are valued based on a modified BlackScholes model using volatility and exercise prices as major observable inputs.\n\nThe Group enters into certain derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce the volatility in the Group's performance due to the exposure to various business-related risks. The risk mitigation is obtained because the derivative's value or cash flows are expected, wholly or partly, to o/ffset changes in the value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. The overall strategy is aiming to mitigate the currency and interest rate risk of positions that are contractually agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of selected anticipated transactions.\n\nCertain derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is extensive documentation on inception and proving on a regular basis that the economic hedge is e/ffective for accounting purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated in a hedge relationship. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized  immediately  in  'Other  financial  income  and expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIn addition, the Group has designated certain longterm debt components as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations. On consolidation, foreign currency di/fferences arising on long-term debt designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects, to the extent that the hedge is e/ffective. The foreign currency di/fferences arising from hedge ine/ffectiveness are recognized in the income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nWhen a hedged net investment is disposed of, the proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recognized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment is transferred to the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or production cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. This value is used for the 'Cost of goods sold' in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable inventory is fully written o/ff in the consolidated income statement under 'Cost of goods sold.'\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjustments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, chargebacks and cash discounts.\n\nProvisions for doubtful trade receivables are established using a forward-looking expected credit loss model (ECL), which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivable. These provisions represent the difference between the trade receivable's carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated collectible amount. Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in the consolidated income statement within 'Selling, general and administration' expenses.\n\n## Legal and environmental liabilities\n\nNovartis and its subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, environmental remediation liabilities and other product-related and commercial litigation, and governmental investigations and proceedings.  A provision is recorded when there is a probable outflow of resources for which a reliable estimate can be made of the outcome of the legal or other disputes against the subsidiary.\n\n## Contingent consideration\n\nIn the acquisition or divestment of a business, it is necessary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners, representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or  market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time.\n\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Cost of goods sold' for currently marketed products and in 'Research and development' for IPR&D. Changes in contingent consideration assets are recognized in 'Other income' or 'Other expense,' depending on their nature.",

The current service cost for such post- employment benefit plans is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which employees are employed, while the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as 'Other expense' or 'Other income.'\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is di/fferent from the settlement date, when the transaction is ultimately e/ffected. Treasury shares are deducted from consolidated equity at their nominal  value  of  CHF/uni00A0 0.50  per  share.  Di/fferences between the nominal amount and the transaction price on purchases or sales of treasury shares with third parties, or the value of services received for the shares allocated to employees as part of share-based compensation arrangements, are recorded in 'Retained earnings' in the  consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue on the sale of Novartis Group products and services, which is recorded as 'Net sales to third parties' in the consolidated income statement, is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised goods and services to the customer, substantially all of which is at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or when the services are performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the acceptance criteria. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The amount of revenue recognized  is  based  on  the  consideration  Novartis expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\nThe consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The most common elements of variable consideration are listed below.\n\n- \u00b7  Rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers, retailers, government agencies (including US Medicaid and US  Federal  Medicare  programs),  government\n\nsupported healthcare systems, private health systems, pharmacy  benefit  managers,  managed  healthcare organizations, purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related revenues are recorded, or when the incentives are o/ffered. These rebates and discounts, applied using provision rates, are estimated based on the terms and conditions in the individual states, plans and customer agreements, historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population growth, product pricing including inflation impacts, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, contracts, channels and payers, as appropriate to the individual rebate and discount arrangements.\n\n- \u00b7  Refunds  granted  to  healthcare  providers  under innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e. outcome  based  arrangements)  are  provisioned  and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related sales are recorded. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as specific terms of the individual agreements. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not su/fficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved, until such history is available or the period when the refund right has expired. The  provisions  for  revenue  deductions  under  the innovative  pay-for-performance  agreements  are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience, including the products actual outcomes achieved compared with the anticipated predefined targets.\n- \u00b7 Cash discounts are o/ffered to customers to encourage prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related sales are recorded.\n- \u00b7  Shelf stock adjustments are generally granted to customers, primarily of the Sandoz Division, to cover the inventory held by them at the time a price decline becomes e/ffective. Revenue deduction provisions for shelf stock adjustments are recorded when the price decline is anticipated, based on the impact of the price decline on the customer's estimated inventory levels.\n- \u00b7  Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded as revenue deductions when there is historical experience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future returns. In doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, determined on the basis of historical experience of customer returns and considering any other relevant factors. This is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus products that can be placed back in inventory for resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return basis, without su/fficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is only recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nNet sales to third parties and provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically to reflect experience and to reflect actual amounts as rebates, refunds,",

The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these revenue deductions.\n\n'Other revenue' includes income from profit-sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners, and royalty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intellectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the intellectual property through a license. Royalty income earned from a license is recognized when the underlying sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized at the point in time when it is highly probable that the relevant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of reversal of revenue recognition is remote. 'Other revenue' also includes revenue from activities such as manufacturing or other services rendered, to the extent such revenue is not recorded under net sales to third parties, and is recognized when control transfers to the third party and our performance obligations are satisfied.\n\n## Research and development\n\nInternal research and development (R&D) costs are fully charged to 'Research and development' in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude the capitalization of internal development expenses as an intangible asset until marketing approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a major market such as the United States, the European Union, Switzerland or Japan.\n\nPayments made to third parties, such as contract research and development organizations in compensation for subcontracted R&D, that are deemed not to transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed as internal R&D expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has been received from a regulatory authority in a major market.\n\nPayments made to third parties to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products, including initial upfront and subsequent milestone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for other assets, such as technologies to be used in R&D activities. If additional payments are made to the originator company to continue performing R&D activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed to be compensation for subcontracted R&D services not resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be capitalized if they are deemed to be compensation for the transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property developed at the risk of the originator company. Subsequent internal R&D costs in relation to IPR&D and other assets are expensed, since the technical feasibility of the internal R&D activity can only be demonstrated by\n\nthe receipt of marketing approval for a related product from a regulatory authority in a major market.\n\nCosts for post-approval studies performed to support the continued registration of a marketed product are recognized as marketing expenses. Costs for activities that are required by regulatory authorities as a condition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed products.\n\nInventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is fully provisioned, and the charge is included in 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement, as its ultimate use  cannot be assured. If this inventory can subsequently be sold, the provision is released to 'Other income' in the consolidated income statement, either on approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use (CHMP), if approval is virtually certain.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nVested  Novartis  shares  and  American  Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are granted as compensation are valued at their market value on the grant date and are immediately expensed in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe fair values of unvested restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) in Novartis shares and ADRs granted to employees  as  compensation  are  recognized  as  an expense over the related vesting period. The expense recorded  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which the employees are employed.\n\nUnvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted for the net present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.\n\nPSUs are subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria during the vesting period and require plan participants to provide services during this period. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the accounting policies for the share-based compensation plan that grant PSUs.\n\nFor PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on assumptions concerning the expected performance against the internal performance metrics throughout the vesting period. The assumptions are based on the Group's targets for those performance metrics, and the expected forfeitures due to plan participants  not  meeting  their  service  conditions.  The",

The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date.\n\nFor PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on variables that can be observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period, and that are conditional on the provision of services by the plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on the total fair value of the grant over the vesting period. IFRS requires that these variables that can be observed in the market are taken into account in determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis determined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Adjustments to the number of equity instruments granted are only made if a plan participant does not fulfill the service conditions.\n\nFor PSUs granted under plans that are subject to both performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and Novartis TSR relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on a bifurcation into the components based on the performance criteria related to Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR, as described in the paragraphs above.\n\nMeasuring the fair values of PSUs granted that include TSR performance criteria requires use of estimates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria requires the probability of factors related to uncertain future events; the term of the award; the grant price of underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity instruments with those of the peer group of companies; and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters.\n\nIf a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other than  retirement,  disability  or  death,  then  unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connection with a reorganization or divestment.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from governments or similar organizations are recognized at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.\n\nGovernment grants received to compensate costs are deferred and recognized in the consolidated income\n\nstatement over the period necessary to match them against the related costs that they are intended to compensate.\n\nThe accounting policy for property, plant and equipment describes the treatment of any related grants.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized for the direct expenditure arising from the restructuring, where the plans are su/fficiently detailed and where appropriate communication to those a/ffected has been made.\n\nCharges to increase restructuring provisions are included in 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statements.\n\n## Healthcare contributions\n\nHealthcare cost contribution levies and fees under governmental programs that require the Group to contribute to a country's healthcare costs, other than programs described in 'Revenue recognition' in this Note 1, are recognized  in  'Other  expense'  in  the  consolidated income statement. Provisions for healthcare cost contributions are adjusted to the actual amounts levied. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these healthcare cost contributions.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  comprise  current  income  taxes  and deferred income taxes and are recognized in the same periods as the revenues and expenses to which they relate.  Income  taxes  include  interest  and  penalties incurred during the period, insofar as they are considered an income tax. Income taxes related to items recognized directly to other comprehensive income or to equity are recognized together with the corresponding item, to which the income tax is attributable, directly in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\nDeferred income taxes are determined using the comprehensive liability method and are calculated on the temporary di/fferences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value for financial reporting purposes, except for those temporary di/fferences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, where the timing of their reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the retained earnings are reinvested, withholding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a subsidiary's retained earnings are only recognized when a dividend is declared or has been planned. Furthermore, deferred income taxes are recognized for the net tax e/ffects of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  is reduced to the extent that it is not probable that su/fficient taxable profits will be available to enable all or part of the asset to be recovered. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from",

The tax returns are subject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, which may result in an assessment being made requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties.\n\nThe calculation of income tax assets and liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. As a result, inherent uncertainties exist in the estimates of the tax positions. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax provisions are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets within current income tax liabilities.\n\n## Impact of new IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations in 2022\n\nThere were no new IFRS standards adopted by the Group in 2022. In addition, new IFRS amendments or interpretations that became e/ffective in 2022 did not have a material impact to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on the Group's assessment, there are no IFRS standards, amendments or interpretations not yet e/ffective in 2022 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2021\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Benchmark Reform Amendments)\n\nInterest Benchmark Reform Amendments became e/ffective from January 1, 2021. These amendments address issues that might a/ffect financial reporting when an existing interest rate benchmark (i.e. Interbank o/ffered rate IBOR) is replaced with an alternative benchmark interest rate. The e/ffects of interest rate benchmark reform on the Group's financial instruments and risk management strategies did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2020\n\nThe following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2020:\n\n## IFRS 3 Business Combinations amendments\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations that revised the definition of a business, which assist entities with the evaluation of when an asset or group of assets acquired should be considered a business. This amended standard has been applied to transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2020. The amended standard allows an entity to apply an optional concentration  test,  on  a  transaction-by-transaction basis, to evaluate whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If this optional concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business. The adoption of this amended standard on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods. However, this will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions and if the Group decides to apply the optional concentration test in the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is or is not a business.\n\nThe following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2021:",

Gyroscope focuses on the discovery and development of gene therapy treatments for retinal indications. The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of USD 0.8 billion, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments, and potential additional milestone payments of up to USD 0.7 billion, which Gyroscope shareholders are eligible to receive upon achievement of specified milestones. The acquisition closed on February 17, 2022.\n\nThe fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 1.0 billion. The amount consisted of an upfront cash payment of USD 0.8 billion (including customary purchase price adjustments) and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Gyroscope shareholders are eligible to receive upon achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.9 billion, consisting primarily of intangible assets of USD 1.1 billion and net deferred  tax  liabilities  of  USD  0.2  billion.

It excluded the rights in the US, Australia and Germany to certain of those brands, which were previously divested by GSK, and the rights in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan (to certain of the brands) and China, which will be retained by GSK. The transaction closed on October 8, 2021.\n\nThe purchase price consisted of a USD 350 million upfront payment paid at closing and potential milestone payments up to USD 150 million, which GSK will be eligible to receive upon the achievement of certain annual sales milestones for the portfolio.\n\nThe fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 415 million. The amount consisted of a payment of USD 351 million, including purchase price adjustments, and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 64 million, which GSK is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 308 million, consisting of USD 292 million intangible assets and USD 16 million deferred tax assets. Goodwill amounted to USD 107 million.\n\nThe 2021 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.\n\n## Corporate - divestment of the investment in Roche Holding AG\n\nOn November 3, 2021, Novartis entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with Roche Holding AG under which Novartis agreed to sell 53.3 million (approximately 33.3%) bearer shares of Roche Holding AG voting shares in a bilateral transaction to Roche Holding AG for a total consideration of USD 20.7 billion. As a result, Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021.\n\nThe  transaction  closed  on  December  6,  2021.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on December 5, 2019, Novartis, through a subsidiary, commenced a tender o/ffer to acquire all outstanding shares of The Medicines Company for USD 85 per share, or a total consideration of approximately USD 9.6 billion in cash on a fully diluted basis, including the equivalent share value related to The Medicines Company's convertible notes, in accordance with their terms. The tender o/ffer expired on January 3, 2020, and on January 6, 2020, the acquiring subsidiary merged with and into The Medicines Company, resulting in The Medicines Company becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis. Novartis financed the transaction through available cash, and short- and long-term borrowings.\n\nThe Medicines Company is focused on the development of inclisiran, a potentially first-in-class, twice yearly therapy that allows administration during patients' routine visits to their healthcare professionals and will potentially contribute to improved patient adherence and sustained lower LDL/hyphen.capC levels.\n\nThe fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 9.6 billion.

Segmentation of key figures 2022, 2021 and 2020\n\nThe businesses of Novartis are divided operationally on a worldwide basis into two identified reporting segments: Innovative Medicines and Sandoz. In addition, we separately report Corporate activities.\n\nReporting segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker, which is the Executive Committee of Novartis. The reporting segments are  managed separately because they each research, develop, manufacture, distribute and sell distinct products that require differing marketing strategies.\n\nThe Executive Committee of Novartis is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the reporting segments.\n\nThe reporting segments are as follows:\n\nInnovative Medicines researches, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells patented pharmaceuticals. E/ffective as of April 4, 2022, the Innovative Medicines Division is organized in two commercial organizational units: Innovative Medicines International and Innovative Medicines US, and is focused on the core therapeutic areas: cardiovascular; immunology; neuroscience; solid tumors and hematology; as well as other promoted brands (in the therapeutic areas of ophthalmology and respiratory)  and  established  brands.  Prior  to  the announcement on April 4, 2022, the Innovative Medicines Division was organized into two global business units: Novartis Oncology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products including active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sandoz is organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics, Anti-Infectives and Biopharmaceuticals. In Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage forms of small molecule pharmaceuticals for sale to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, including finished dosage form of anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers. In Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- or other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies.\n\ncorporate coordination functions in major countries. In addition, Corporate includes other items of income and expense that are not attributable to specific segments, such as certain revenues from intellectual property rights, certain expenses related to post-employment benefits, environmental remediation liabilities, charitable activities, donations and sponsorships. Usually, no allocation of Corporate items is made to the segments. As a result, Corporate assets and liabilities principally consist of net debt (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities less financial debts), investments in associated companies, and current and deferred taxes and non-segment-specific environmental remediation and post-employment benefit liabilities.\n\nOur divisions are supported by Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Global Drug Development, and the Operations unit.\n\n- \u00b7 The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) conducts  research  activities  for  the  Innovative Medicines Division and also collaborates with Sandoz.\n- \u00b7  The Global Drug Development organization oversees all  drug  development  activities  for  our  Innovative Medicines Division and collaborates with our Sandoz Division on the development of its biosimilars portfolio.\n- \u00b7  The Operations unit, combines the Novartis Technical Operations (NTO) and Customer & Technology Solutions  (CTS),  following  the  internal  reorganization announced on April 4, 2022. The Operations unit manages  our  manufacturing  operations  across  our Innovative  Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and delivers business support services across the Group, such as information technology, real estate and facility services and procurement.\n\nThe accounting policies mentioned in Note 1 are used in the reporting of segment results. Inter-segmental sales are made at amounts that are considered to approximate arm's length transactions. The Executive Committee of Novartis evaluates segmental performance and allocates resources among the segments based on a number of measures, including net sales to third parties, operating income and net operating assets. Segment net operating assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment; right-of-use assets; intangible assets; goodwill; inventories; and trade and other operating receivables less operating liabilities.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to Corporate include the costs of the Group headquarters and those of",

See Note 2.\n\nThe Group's holding in Roche voting shares was 33.3% at December 31, 2020. This investment represented approximately 6.2% of Roche's total outstanding voting and non-voting equity instruments at December 31, 2020.\n\nSince full-year financial data for Roche is not available when Novartis produces its consolidated financial results, a survey of analyst estimates is used to estimate the Group's share of Roche's net income. Any di/fferences\n\nbetween  these  estimates  and  actual  results  were adjusted in the Group's consolidated financial statements when available. As Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021, and the divestment closed on December 6, 2021, no such adjustment has been made to the 2022 Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2021, dividends received from Roche in relation to the distribution of its 2020 net income amounted to USD/uni00A0522 million.\n\nThe consolidated income statement e/ffects from applying Novartis accounting principles for this investment in 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                                                                            | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Novartis share of Roche's   estimated current-year                                                                                                                        |                                                        |                                      |\n| consolidated net income                                                                                                                                                   | /eight.tab/one.tab/five.tab                            | /nine.tab/one.tab/three.tab          |\n| Prior-year adjustment                                                                                                                                                     | /four.tab/zero.tab                                     | - /six.tab/four.tab                  |\n| Amortization of fair value                                                                                                                                                |                                                        |                                      |\n| adjustments relating to                                                                                                                                                   |                                                        |                                      |\n| intangible assets, net of taxes   of /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab: USD /one.tab/zero.tab   million; /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab: USD /two.tab/six.tab million | - /seven.tab/zero.tab                                  | - /one.tab/seven.tab/two.tab         |\n| Gain on divestment of the   investment in Roche  /one.tab                                                                                                                 | /one.tab/four.tab/space.tab/five.tab/five.tab/six.tab  |                                      |\n| Net income e/ffect                                                                                                                                                        | /one.tab/five.tab/space.tab/three.tab/four.tab/one.tab | /six.tab/seven.tab/seven.tab         |",

The Group's most material lease with a lease term extension, representing a lease liability value of USD 0.7 billion (2021: USD 0.6 billion), has a determined lease term end date of 2071 (2021: 2071). Non-enforceable extension options of up to 10 years have not been included within the measurement of this lease liability, and do not have a material impact to the carrying value of the lease for both 2022 and 2021. Should the landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be referenced to the market rates as at the commencement of the extension period.\n\nIn 2022, the Group completed three sale and leaseback transactions for certain property, plant and equipment as part of the Groups plans to focus on key operating locations. The transactions resulted in net cash inflows of USD 49 million and the recognition of USD 23 million of lease liabilities, and USD 13 million of right-ofuse assets. The right-of-use assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant and equipment retained. Extension options have been included where management believe that such options will be exercised. The liabilities reflect the net present value of future lease\n\npayments. The net gain on the sale and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 17 million. There were no significant sale and leaseback transactions in 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe following table provides additional disclosures related to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                       | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | 2021                         | 2020                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities  /one.tab                                                                      | /six.tab/zero.tab                   | /six.tab/two.tab             | /six.tab/seven.tab            |\n| Expense on short-term leases                                                                                         | /three.tab                          | /six.tab                     | /four.tab                     |\n| Expense on low-value leases                                                                                          | /six.tab                            | /seven.tab                   | /seven.tab                    |\n| Total cash outflows for leases                                                                                       | /three.tab/five.tab/five.tab        | /three.tab/eight.tab/one.tab | /three.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Thereof:                                                                                     |                                     |                              |                               |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Cash outflows for short-term leases   /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0and low-value leases  /two.tab | /nine.tab                           | /one.tab/three.tab           | /one.tab/one.tab              |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Payments of interest  /three.tab                                                             | /five.tab/one.tab                   | /five.tab/two.tab            | /five.tab/six.tab             |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Payments of lease liabilities  /four.tab                                                     | /two.tab/nine.tab/five.tab          | /three.tab/one.tab/six.tab   | /three.tab/one.tab/two.tab    |\n\nThe following table shows the right-of-use assets carrying value and depreciation charge at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by underlying class of asset:\n\n| (USD millions)                              | December /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab carrying value   | Depreciation  charge /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | December /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   carrying value   | Depreciation  charge /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Land                                        | /five.tab/zero.tab/five.tab                                                     | /one.tab/six.tab                                         | /five.tab/two.tab/two.tab                                                         | /one.tab/one.tab                                         |\n| Buildings                                   | /seven.tab/four.tab/five.tab                                                    | /one.tab/seven.tab/seven.tab                             | /eight.tab/six.tab/six.tab                                                        | /one.tab/nine.tab/two.tab                                |\n| Vehicles                                    | /one.tab/one.tab/seven.tab                                                      | /nine.tab/six.tab                                        | /one.tab/three.tab/six.tab                                                        | /one.tab/zero.tab/five.tab                               |\n| Machinery and  equipment, and  other assets | /six.tab/four.tab                                                               | /one.tab/one.tab                                         | /three.tab/seven.tab                                                              | /one.tab/zero.tab                                        |\n| Total right-of-use  assets                  | /one.tab/space.tab/four.tab/three.tab/one.tab                                   | /three.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab                             | /one.tab/space.tab/five.tab/six.tab/one.tab                                       | /three.tab/one.tab/eight.tab                             |",

We particularly monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic  environment,  historical  experience, country and political risk, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are monitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these",

Novartis is able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could be subject to a 90-day waiting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2022.

Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time but would have been subject to a 90-day waiting period.\n\nThis trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in June 2021, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback.

The commitment under this arrangement therefore reflected the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trading plan.\n\nThe commitment under this arrangement amounted to USD 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in March 2021, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021.\n\nrepurchase Novartis shares to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of associates.

A total of 3.7 million options were repurchased under this agreement. This agreement was terminated in November 2020.\n\n18.5) The impact of change in ownership of consolidated entities represents the excess of the amount paid to non-controlling interest over their carrying value and equity  allocation  to  non-controlling  interest  due  to change in ownership percentage.\n\n18.6) Changes in non-controlling interests represent the impact on the non-controlling interest of transactions with minority shareholders, such as change in ownership percentage, dividend payments and other equity transactions.\n\n18.7) Other movements include, for subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies, the impact of the restatement of the equity balances of the current year as well as restatement of the non-monetary assets and liabilities with the general price index at the beginning of the period. See Note 29 for additional disclosures.\n\n18.8) In 2021, transaction costs that were directly attributable to the distribution (spin-o/ff) of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded to equity.\n\nIn August 2020, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary  arrangement  with  a  bank  to",

The provisions are reassessed on an annual basis and adjusted as necessary.\n\nIn the United States, Novartis has been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the\n\nnumber of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of the liability.\n\nThe expected timing of the related cash outflows as of December 31, 2022, is currently projected as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                | Expected  cash outflows       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Due within two years                                          | /one.tab/two.tab/eight.tab    |\n| Due later than two years, but within five years               | /one.tab/six.tab/three.tab    |\n| Due later than five years, but within /one.tab/zero.tab years | /two.tab/five.tab/one.tab     |\n| Due after /one.tab/zero.tab years                             | /four.tab/six.tab             |\n| Total environmental remediation provisions                    | /five.tab/eight.tab/eight.tab |\n\n## Provisions for product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters\n\nNovartis has established provisions for certain product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters where a potential cash outflow is probable and Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of the outflow. These provisions represent the Group's current best estimate of the total financial e/ffect for the matters described below and for other less significant matters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision might be fully or partially o/ffset by insurance in certain circumstances.\n\nNovartis has not established provisions for potential damage awards for certain additional legal claims against its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. These not-provisioned-for matters include individual product liability cases and certain other legal matters. Plainti/ffs' have alleged claims in these matters and the Group does not believe that information about the amount sought by plainti/ffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law. Therefore, it is not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of these matters. In addition, in some of",

        "page_content": "these matters there are claims for punitive or multiple (treble) damages, civil penalties and disgorgement of profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or partially unspecified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable at present; the Group believes that information about these amounts claimed by plainti/ffs generally is not meaningful for purposes of determining a reliable estimate of a loss that is probable or more than remote.\n\nA number of other legal matters are in such early stages or the issues presented are such that the Group has not made any provisions since it cannot currently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount of any potential losses. For these reasons, among others, the Group generally is unable to make a reliable estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It is therefore not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of those cases.\n\nThere might also be cases for which the Group was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss or the range of possible loss, but the Group believes that publication of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice the Group's position in ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contingency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss.\n\nNote 28 contains additional information on contingent liabilities.\n\n## Summary of significant legal proceedings\n\nThe following is a summary of significant legal proceedings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a party, or were a party and that concluded in 2022.\n\n## Investigations and related litigations Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya marketing practices investigation and litigation\n\nIn 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) received a civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney's O/ffice (USAO) for the S.D.N.Y. requesting the production of documents and information relating to marketing practices for Gilenya , including the remuneration of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to intervene in claims raised by an individual relator in a qui tam complaint. In 2022, NPC's motion to dismiss this complaint was granted, which was appealed. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Government generic pricing antitrust investigations, antitrust class actions\n\nSince 2016, Sandoz Inc. has received a grand jury subpoena and a civil investigative demand and interrogatories from the Antitrust and Civil Divisions of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) into alleged price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States as well as alleged federal False Claims Act (FCA) violations. Sandoz Inc. also received a subpoena and interrogatories from the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut in connection with a similar States' investigation.\n\nIn 2020, Sandoz Inc. reached a resolution with the DOJ Antitrust Division, pursuant to which Sandoz Inc. paid USD 195 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement.  The  Sandoz  Inc.  resolution  related  to instances of misconduct at the Company between 2013 and 2015 with regard to certain generic drugs sold in the United States. Under the terms of that agreement, Sandoz Inc. will continue to take steps to enhance its compliance program, employee training and monitoring, and will continue to cooperate with the US government's ongoing investigation into the generic pharmaceutical industry. Sandoz Inc. also finalized a resolution with the DOJ Civil Division and in 2021 paid USD 185 million, which includes interest from the date of the agreement in principle, to settle related claims arising under the FCA, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the O/ffice of Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This resolution with the DOJ resolves all federal government matters related to price fixing allegations.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2016, Sandoz Inc. and Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. have been sued alongside other generic pharmaceutical companies in numerous individual and putative class action complaints by direct and indirect private purchasers and by over 50 US states and territories, represented by their respective Attorneys General.  Plainti/ffs  claim  that  defendants,  including Sandoz Inc., engaged in price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States, and seek damages and injunctive relief. The litigation includes complaints alleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as complaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry conspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penalties under federal and state antitrust and consumer protection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC) for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Lucentis/Avastin \u00ae matters\n\nIn connection with an investigation into whether Novartis entities, F. Ho/ffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and Roche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market positions of Avastin \u00ae and Lucentis , in 2014 the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent to USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid the fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment, and appealed before the Consiglio di Stato (CdS). In 2014 and 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombardia region sent letters with payment requests for a total equivalent of approximately USD/uni00A01.3 billion in damages from Novartis and Roche entities based on these allegations. In 2019, the CdS upheld the ICA decision and fine. Following that CdS decision, several additional Italian regions and hospitals sent letters claiming damages for an aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million. None of these claims have been asserted in legal proceedings and no further letters have been sent since. Novartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to",

        "page_content": "2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA's decision. Novartis is the subject of similar investigations and proceedings involving competition authorities in Belgium and Greece and is currently in the appeal process in Turkey. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in all those countries.  Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing o/ff-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in Turkey.\n\n## Greece investigation\n\nThe Greek authorities are investigating legacy allegations of potentially inappropriate economic benefits to HCPs, government o/fficials and others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordinating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from which the Company received a summons in 2018 and 2020. Novartis has cooperated in these investigations. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine equivalent to approximately  USD  1.2  million,  which  Novartis  Hellas  has appealed. In 2022, the Greek State served a civil lawsuit on Novartis Hellas, seeking approximately USD 225 million for moral damages allegedly arising from the conduct that was the subject of the Company's 2020 settlement  with  the  DOJ  regarding  allegations  of inappropriate economic benefits in Greece that was disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report and the 2020 Form 20-F. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## 340B Drug Pricing Program investigations\n\nIn 2021, NPC received a notification from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which stated that HRSA believes NPC's contract pharmacy policy violates the 340B statute, and threatened potential enforcement action. NPC subsequently sued HRSA in the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge HRSA's determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking action with respect to NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC's contract pharmacy policy to OIG, which could result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. The USDC issued a decision rejecting HRSA's interpretation of the 340B statute, vacating the violation notification and remanding the matter to HRSA. HRSA appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit heard argument on the case in 2022. In addition, in 2021, Emory University Hospital Midtown filed an Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceeding against NPC, seeking the return of alleged overcharges resulting from NPC's contract pharmacy policy. NPC has moved to dismiss the proceeding pending resolution of the HRSA litigation. Finally, also in 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from the O/ffice of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont requesting the production of documents and information concerning NPC's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont; NPC provided documents and information to the O/ffice of the Attorney General.\n\n## Swiss and EU investigation\n\nIn September 2022, the Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) initiated an investigation of Novartis acquisition of certain patents from Genentech in April 2020 and their subsequent enforcement against Eli Lilly and other parties, allegedly in an attempt to protect Cosentyx from competing products. COMCO is investigating whether enforcement of the patents violates the Swiss Cartel Act. The European Commission also requested information from Novartis regarding this matter. Novartis is cooperating with the authorities and will vigorously contest any allegations.\n\n## Antitrust class actions Exforge\n\nSince 2018, Novartis Group companies as well as other pharmaceutical companies have been sued by various direct and indirect purchasers of Exforge in multiple US individual and putative class action complaints. They claim that Novartis made a reverse payment in the form of an agreement not to launch an authorized generic, alleging violations of federal antitrust law and state antitrust, consumer protection and common laws, and seeking damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases have been consolidated in the S.D.N.Y. In 2022, Novartis agreed to a settlement in principle to pay USD 245 million to resolve these cases. These settlements are subject to mutually agreeable terms, finalization of documentation and, in some cases, court approval.\n\n## Product liability litigation Reclast\n\nNPC is a defendant in more than 20 US product liability actions involving Reclast and alleging atypical femur fracture injuries, all of which are in New Jersey state or federal court and in California state court, coordinated with claims against other bisphosphonate manufacturers. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Taxotere \u00ae (docetaxel)\n\nSandoz is a defendant in more than 3 100 US product liability  actions  involving  Taxotere \u00ae (docetaxel),  an oncology product, many of which have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The complaints allege misleading marketing and that Sanofi, as innovator, and several 505(b)(2) NDA holders (including Sandoz) failed to warn of the risk of permanent alopecia/hair loss. In 2022, actions involving claims related to alleged eye injuries caused by the use of Taxotere \u00ae were coordinated in a separate multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Amiodarone\n\nSandoz entities are named in two multi-plainti/ff US product liability cases involving amiodarone, a cardiac drug indicated to treat life-threatening arrhythmias that have not responded to other treatment. The complaints allege failure to warn, o/ff-label promotion, and failure to include medication guides to pharmacies. The claims are being vigorously contested.",

        "page_content": "## Sartans and ranitidine\n\nSince 2018, claims have been brought against Sandoz and other pharmaceutical companies alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities found in valsartan and valsartan/ HCT film-coated tablets and/or losartan marketed or manufactured by Sandoz. These claims include several putative class actions in Canada. Claims have also been brought alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities in ranitidine-containing  medicines.  These  claims  also include several putative class actions in Canada and a multidistrict litigation in Florida. All of these claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Tasigna\n\nNPC is a defendant in more than 400 US product liability actions involving Tasigna , alleging that the product caused various cardiovascular e/ffects and that NPC failed to provide adequate warnings about those alleged side e/ffects. State court actions are pending in a multicounty litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and federal cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Other matters Shareholder derivative lawsuit\n\nIn 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation and certain present and former directors and o/fficers of Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was named as a nominal defendant, in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in New York state court. The plainti/ffs, derivatively as purported Novartis shareholders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate and individual defendants. In 2022, the court granted Novartis motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which the plainti/ffs have appealed.\n\n## Concluded legal matters Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation Concluded matter\n\nLawsuits were brought, the latest in February 2016, by various US state governmental entities and private parties against various pharmaceutical companies, including NPC, alleging that they fraudulently overstated the AWP that is or has been used by payers, including state Medicaid agencies, to calculate reimbursements to healthcare providers. In 2022, NPC settled a putative class action brought by private payers in New Jersey,\n\nwhich resolved the last AWP lawsuit. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Entresto matter- Concluded matter\n\nIn 2021, NPC received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information from 2016 to the present regarding the marketing and pricing of Entresto, including remuneration provided to HCPs.  In December 2022, the DOJ advised that it has no additional requests and that the matter is considered closed. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## South Korea investigation - Concluded matter\n\nIn 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation into, among other things, allegations that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to provide inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare professionals (HCPs).

The goodwill arising out of these acquisitions is\n\nattributable to the buyer-specific synergies, the assembled workforce, and the accounting for deferred tax liabilities on the acquired assets. In 2022, no goodwill (2021: USD 107 million; 2020: USD 74 million) is tax deductible.\n\n## 25. Post-employment benefits for employees\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nIn addition to the legally required social security schemes, the Group has numerous independent pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Group. For certain Group companies, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations of employees. In these cases, the related unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations (DBOs) of all major pension and other post-employment benefit plans are reappraised annually by independent actuaries. Plan assets are recognized at fair value. The major plans are based in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, which represent 95% of the Group's total DBO for pension plans. Details of the plans in the two most significant countries, Switzerland and the United States, which\n\nrepresent 83% of the Group's total DBO for post-employment benefit plans, are provided below.\n\nSwiss-based pension plans represent the most significant portion of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. For the active insured members the benefits are linked to  contributions  paid  into  the  plan,  interest  credits granted and conversion rates applied.\n\nAll benefits granted under Swiss-based pension plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an employee's pay to an external pension fund. Additional employer contributions may be required whenever the plan's statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed by a board of trustees that - for the principal plans - consists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the active insured employees. The boards of trustees are responsible for the plan design and asset investment strategy.",

        "page_content": "In December 2020, the Board of Trustees of the Novartis Swiss Pension Fund agreed to adjust the annuity conversion rate at retirement with e/ffect from January 1, 2022. This amendment did not a/ffect existing pensioners, and its impact on existing plan participants will be mitigated by way of defined compensatory measures. This amendment resulted in a net pre-tax curtailment gain of USD 101 million (CHF 90 million) recognized in 2020.\n\nThe United States pension plans represent the second-largest component of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer\n\ncontributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level.\n\nFurthermore, in certain countries, employees are covered under other post-employment benefit plans and post-retirement medical plans.\n\nIn the US, other post-employment benefit plans consist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, which have been closed to new members since 2015. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax e/fficient.\n\nThe following tables are a summary of the funded and unfunded defined benefit obligation for pension and other post-employment benefit plans of employees at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n|                                                                                    | Pension plans                                             | Pension plans                                             | Other post-employment benefit plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (USD millions)                                                                     | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab                         | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                         | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab     | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab     |\n| Benefit obligation at January /one.tab                                             | /two.tab/three.tab/space.tab/five.tab/eight.tab/three.tab | /two.tab/five.tab/space.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/two.tab      | /five.tab/six.tab/zero.tab            | /six.tab/three.tab/two.tab            |\n| Current service cost                                                               | /three.tab/four.tab/eight.tab                             | /four.tab/one.tab/five.tab                                | /one.tab/two.tab                      | /one.tab/one.tab                      |\n| Interest cost                                                                      | /two.tab/four.tab/nine.tab                                | /one.tab/five.tab/one.tab                                 | /one.tab/seven.tab                    | /one.tab/six.tab                      |\n| Past service costs and settlements                                                 | -

This can result in substantial changes in the Group's other comprehensive income, long-term liabilities and prepaid  pension assets.\n\nThe DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuarially determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high-quality  corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO increases and the funded status decreases.\n\nIn Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower discount rates is slightly o/ffset by lower future benefits expected to be paid on the employee's savings account where the assumption on interest accrued often changes broadly in line with the  discount rate.\n\nThe impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan's assets is more di/fficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore partially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of equity instruments. Share prices usually tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often counteract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit  obligation  on  the  funded  status  (although  the\n\ncorrelation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with bonds, especially in the short term).\n\nThe expected rate for pension increases significantly a/ffects the DBO of most plans in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Such pension increases also decrease the funded status, although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases.\n\nAssumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the DBO. There is no o/ffsetting impact from the plan assets, as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds. The Group's actuaries use mortality tables which take  into  account  historic  patterns  and  expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.\n\nIn 2022 the mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2020 tables with future improvements based on the BVG generational model. In US for the Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefit Plans, the Society of Actuaries Pri2012 mortality tables with generational improvements based on Scale MP-2021 are used.\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the defined  benefit pension obligation to the principal actuarial assumptions for the major plans in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on an aggregated basis:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                        | Change in /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab  year-end defined  benefit pension  obligation   | Change in /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab  year-end defined  benefit pension  obligation   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point increase in discount rate               | - /four.tab/six.tab/six.tab                                                                  | - /seven.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab                                                               |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point decrease in discount rate               | /four.tab/nine.tab/one.tab                                                                   | /eight.tab/three.tab/nine.tab                                                                |\n| One-year increase in life expectancy                                  | /five.tab/three.tab/five.tab                                                                 | /eight.tab/six.tab/nine.tab                                                                  |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point increase in rate of pension increase    | /three.tab/one.tab/six.tab                                                                   | /five.tab/one.tab/two.tab                                                                    |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point decrease in rate of pension increase    | - /six.tab/three.tab                                                                         | - /one.tab/three.tab/six.tab                                                                 |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point increase of interest on savings account | /three.tab/eight.tab                                                                         | /five.tab/eight.tab                                                                          |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point decrease of interest on savings account | - /three.tab/seven.tab                                                                       | - /five.tab/eight.tab                                                                        |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point increase in rate of salary increase     | /three.tab/seven.tab                                                                         | /five.tab/four.tab                                                                           |\n| /two.tab/five.tab basis point decrease in rate of salary increase     | - /three.tab/seven.tab                                                                       | - /five.tab/four.tab                                                                         |",

For the Novartis Top Leaders (NTLs), the Annual Incentive is paid 70% in cash and 30% in RSs or RSUs. Both the ECN and NTLs can opt to invest up to the maximum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive further RSs or RSUs. Any cash is paid out during March in the year following the end of the performance period, and the shares are granted during January in the year following the end of the performance period.\n\n## Employee share savings plan\n\nNovartis operates employee share savings and purchase plans  in  certain  countries.  The  most  significant  is described below.\n\nThe Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) in Switzerland o/ffers participants to choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100% in shares, (ii) 50% in shares and 50% in cash, or (iii) 100% in cash. After expiration of  a  three-year  holding  period  for  Novartis  shares invested under the ESOP, participants will receive one matching share for every two invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan 'Select' are not eligible to receive ESOP matching shares. The Novartis Group CEO, the other Executive Committee members and the NTLs are not eligible to participate in this plan.\n\n## Novartis Employee share purchase plan\n\nIn 2022 Novartis started to grant shares under the Employee  Share  Purchase  Plan.  The  plan  enables employees  to  voluntarily  purchase  Novartis  shares through payroll deductions at a discounted price. While the plan is global in scope, the first phase covers: North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada). The shares are not subject to a vesting period.\n\n## Novartis equity plan 'Select'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' is a global equity incentive plan under which eligible employees may annually be awarded a grant subject to a three-year, and for selected units a four-year, staggered vesting period. No awards are granted for performance ratings below a certain threshold. Executive Committee members and NTLs are not eligible to participate in the equity plan 'Select.'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' currently allows participants employed and living in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity compensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally. Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share options.\n\nTradable share options expire on their 10 th anniversary from the grant date, meaning all outstanding options exercisable at December 31, 2022, will expire in January 2023. Each tradable share option entitles the holder to purchase after vesting (and before the 10 th anniversary from the grant date) one Novartis share at a stated exercise price that equals the closing market price of the underlying share at the grant date. As the exercise price does not reflect the decrease in the Novartis share due to the Alcon spin, one-fifth of an Alcon share will also be awarded to the option holder upon exercise.\n\n## Options under Novartis equity plan 'Select' outside North America\n\nThe following table shows the activity associated with the share options during the period. The weighted average prices in the table below are translated from Swiss francs into USD at historical rates.\n\n|                                            | 2022                          | 2022                                    | 2021                            | 2021                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Options (millions)            | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD) | Options   (millions)            | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD) |\n| Options outstanding   at January /one.tab  | /one.tab/period.tab/seven.tab | /six.tab/three.tab/period.tab/six.tab   | /two.tab/period.tab/six.tab     | /six.tab/two.tab/period.tab/zero.tab    |\n| Sold or exercised                          | - /one.tab/period.tab/two.tab | /six.tab/two.tab/period.tab/six.tab     | - /zero.tab/period.tab/nine.tab | /five.tab/eight.tab/period.tab/nine.tab |\n| Outstanding at December /three.tab/one.tab | /zero.tab/period.tab/five.tab | /six.tab/six.tab/period.tab/zero.tab    | /one.tab/period.tab/seven.tab   | /six.tab/three.tab/period.tab/six.tab   |\n| Exercisable at December /three.tab/one.tab | /zero.tab/period.tab/five.tab | /six.tab/six.tab/period.tab/zero.tab    | /one.tab/period.tab/seven.tab   | /six.tab/three.tab/period.tab/six.tab   |\n\nAll share options were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the closing market price of the Group's shares at the grant date.

The weighted average ADR price at the dates of sale or exercise was USD/uni00A089.1.\n\n## Long-Term Performance Plan\n\nThe Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) is an equity plan for the ECN, the NTLs and employees of Group units with specific targets.\n\nParticipants are granted a target number of performance share units (PSUs) at the beginning of every performance period, which are converted into unrestricted Novartis shares after the performance period. The actual payout depends on the achievement of the performance measures and ranges between 0% and 200% of the granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe LTPP awards are subject to a three-year performance and vesting period. Until 2018, the performance criteria were based on Novartis internal performance metrics. For LTPP awards starting in 2019, following the combination of the two LTPP and Long-Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), the performance criteria are based on both Novartis internal performance metrics and variables that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods.\n\nTSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as the change in the company share price, which is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, including the reinvestment return of dividends, over the threeyear performance period. The calculation is based on\n\nBloomberg standard published TSR data, which is publicly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group determines the payout range based on a payout matrix.\n\n## Long-Term Relative Performance Plan\n\nThe LTRPP was an equity plan for the Novartis ECN and NTLs and the awards were subject to a three-year performance and vesting period. The last grant under this plan was made in 2018. The LTRPP performance criteria were based on variables that could be observed in the market, which was the ranking of the Novartis TSR relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods. The TSR for Novartis and the peer companies was calculated as described in the LTPP section above.\n\n## Other share awards\n\nSelected employees may exceptionally receive Special Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to retain key contributors. They are based on a formal internal selection process, through which the individual performance of each candidate is thoroughly assessed at several management levels. Special Share Awards had a minimum three-year vesting period before 2021 and mainly three years thereafter. In exceptional circumstances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to attract  special  expertise  and  new  talents  to  the organization. Externally recruited ECN members are eligible only for special awards that are 'buyouts' in the case that it is to replace equity forfeited with their former employer. The equity is provided on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at the same value with the same vesting period, and with or without a performance condition.\n\nWorldwide, employees at di/fferent levels in the organization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition, in 2022, 2021 and 2020, Board members received  unrestricted shares as part of their regular compensation.",

From January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021, Lucentis sales of USD/uni00A02.0 billion (2020: USD/uni00A01.9 billion) were recognized by Novartis.\n\n## Xolair\n\nNovartis and Genentech/Roche are co-promoting Xolair in the United States, where Genentech/Roche records\n\n## Novartis Pension Fund\n\nIn 2018, a Group subsidiary provided an uncommitted overnight credit facility to the Novartis Pension Fund, Switzerland, for up to USD 500 million with interest at\n\nall sales. Novartis records sales  outside the United States.\n\nNovartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs outside the United States as well as co-promotion costs in the US. Genentech/Roche and Novartis share the resulting profits from sales in the United States, Europe and other countries, according to agreed profit-sharing  percentages.  From  January  1,  2021  until December 6, 2021, Novartis recognized total sales of Xolair of USD/uni00A01.3 billion (2020: USD/uni00A01.3 billion), including sales to Genentech/Roche for the United States market.\n\n## Luxturna\n\nIn 2018, Novartis entered into an exclusive licensing and commercialization agreement and a supply agreement with Spark for Luxturna outside the United States. The agreements include regulatory and sales milestones as well as royalties payable to Spark on ex-US sales. On December 17, 2019, Roche acquired Spark.\n\nThe net income for royalties, cost sharing and profit sharing arising out of the Lucentis , Xolair and Luxturna agreements with Roche totaled USD/uni00A0188 million from January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021 (net income in 2020: USD/uni00A0217 million).\n\nFurthermore, Novartis has several patent license, supply and distribution agreements with Roche.\n\nthe US Federal Funds Rate.

Note 29 contains further information on the Group's investments in funds.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nThe Group has entered into various purchase commitments for services and materials as well as for equipment in the ordinary course of business.

As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that could a/ffect our business, financial position and reputation. While Novartis does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse e/ffect on its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments sometimes occur.

Further, when one government or regulatory authority undertakes an investigation, it is not uncommon for other governments or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the same or similar matters. Responding to such investigations is costly and requires an increasing amount of management's time and attention. In addition, such investigations  may  a/ffect  our  reputation,  create  a  risk  of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have contributed to decisions by Novartis and other  co mpanies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settlements have involved and may in the future involve large cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases and antitrust cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our a/ffiliates Novartis Corporation and Sandoz Inc. are parties to such agreements, which will expire in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Also, matters underlying governmental\n\ninvestigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation.\n\nWhile provisions have been made for probable outflows of economic resources, which management deems to be  reasonable or appropriate, there are uncertainties connected with these  estimates.\n\nNote 20 contains additional information on these matters.\n\nA number of Group companies are involved in legal proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome. A negative result in any such proceeding could potentially adversely a/ffect the ability of certain Novartis companies to sell their products, or require the payment of substantial damages or royalties. The timing and the outcome of legal proceedings and their potential financial e/ffect are not predictable.\n\nIn the opinion of management, however, the outcome of these actions will not materially a/ffect the Group's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flow in a given period.\n\nThe Group's potential environmental remediation liability is assessed based on a risk assessment and investigation of the various sites identified by the Group as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. The Group's future remediation expenses are a/ffected by a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of material attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.\n\nNote 20 contains additional information on environmental liabilities.",

There are three hierarchical levels, based on increasing  subjectivity associated with the inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabilities, which are as follows:\n\nThe assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and debt securities as well as fund investments listed in active markets.\n\nThe assets generally included in Level 2 fair value hierarchy are derivatives, and certain debt securities. The liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy consist of derivatives. These are valued using corroborated market data.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. The assets generally included in Level 3 fair value hierarchy are various investments in funds and unquoted equity security investments. Contingent consideration and other financial liabilities carried at fair value are included in this category.\n\n|                                                                                | 2022                          | 2022                       | 2022                                          | 2022                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| (USD millions)                                                                 | Level /one.tab                | Level /two.tab             | Level /three.tab                              | Total                                          |\n| Financial assets                                                               |                               |                            |                                               |                                                |\n| Marketable securities                                                          |                               |                            |                                               |                                                |\n| Debt securities                                                                |                               | /nine.tab                  |                                               | /nine.tab                                      |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                               |                               | /two.tab/zero.tab/four.tab |                                               | /two.tab/zero.tab/four.tab                     |\n| Total marketable securities and derivative financial instruments at fair value |                               | /two.tab/one.tab/three.tab |                                               | /two.tab/one.tab/three.tab                     |\n| Current contingent consideration receivables                                   |                               |                            | /four.tab/three.tab                           | /four.tab/three.tab                            |\n| Long-term financial investments                                                |                               |                            |                                               |                                                |\n| Debt and equity securities                                                     | /four.tab/seven.tab/three.tab | /one.tab/zero.tab          | /six.tab/nine.tab/nine.tab                    | /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/eight.tab/two.tab   |\n| Fund investments                                                               | /two.tab/zero.tab             |                            | /two.tab/six.tab/one.tab                      | /two.tab/eight.tab/one.tab                     |\n| Non-current contingent consideration receivables                               |                               |                            | /six.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab                   | /six.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab                    |\n| Total long-term financial investments at fair value                            | /four.tab/nine.tab/three.tab  | /one.tab/zero.tab          | /one.tab/space.tab/five.tab/six.tab/seven.tab | /two.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/zero.tab |\n| Associated companies at fair value through profit and loss                     |                               |                            | /one.tab/two.tab/nine.tab                     | /one.tab/two.tab/nine.tab                      |\n| Financial liabilities                                                          |                               |                            |                                               |                                                |\n| Current contingent consideration liabilities                                   |                               |                            | -

During 2022, there were no transfers of equity securities from Level 1 to Level 3 due to de-listing (2021: USD 29 million).\n\nRealized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through the consolidated income statement are recorded in the consolidated income statement under 'Other income' or 'Other expense,' respectively. Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled through the consolidated income statement but are instead reclassified to retained earnings.\n\nDuring the year, the net loss and net gain recorded on associated companies, fund investments and longterm financial investments at fair value through profit and loss were USD 316 million and USD 55 million, respectively.\n\nTo  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  contingent consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A change in these inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used are, among others, the probability of success, sales forecast and assumptions regarding the discount rate and timing and di/fferent scenarios of triggering events. The inputs are  interrelated. The significance and usage of these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary due to di/fferences in the timing and triggering events for payments or in the nature of the asset related to the contingent consideration.\n\nIf the most significant parameters for the Level/uni00A03 input were to change by 10% positively or negatively, or where the probability of success (POS) is the most significant input parameter, 10% were added or deducted from the applied probability of success, for contingent consideration payables and contingent consideration receivables, this would change the amounts recorded in the 2022\n\nconsolidated income statement by USD/uni00A0154 million and USD/uni00A0140 million, respectively.\n\n## Equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nEquity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. These are made up of individually non-significant investments. At December 31, 2022, the Group holds 65 nonlisted equity securities (December 31, 2021: 60) and 46 listed equity securities (December 31, 2021: 40) in this category with the following fair values:\n\n| (USD millions)               | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab            |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Listed equity securities     | /four.tab/three.tab/eight.tab       | /eight.tab/eight.tab/eight.tab               |\n| Non-listed equity securities | /three.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab        | /three.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab                |\n| Total equity securities      | /eight.tab/two.tab/eight.tab        | /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/nine.tab/five.tab |\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, dividends received from these equity securities were insignificant. In 2022, in accordance with the consolidated foundations Alcon Inc. shares divestment plans, Alcon Inc. shares with a fair value of USD/uni00A022 million were sold (2021: USD 9 million), and the USD/uni00A07 million gain on disposal (2021: USD 1 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings during 2022. In addition, in 2022, equity securities that were no longer considered strategic, with a fair value of USD/uni00A03 million (2021: USD/uni00A0254 million), were sold, and the USD/uni00A03 million loss on disposal (2021: USD/uni00A0211 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see Note 8).",

        "page_content": "## Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk in general comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of the investments. The Group actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. It is the Group's policy and practice to enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the volatility of these exposures. It does not enter into any financial  transactions  containing  a  risk  that  cannot  be quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or does not know it will have, in the future. The Group only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based on past experience.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Group's results of operations, including reported sales and earnings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly a/ffect the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nBecause our expenditures in Swiss francs are significantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, volatility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could experience a devaluation of their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the e/ffective prices we would be able to charge for our products and also have an adverse impact on both our consolidated income statement and balance sheet.\n\nSubsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years apply the principles of IAS 29 'Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.' The hyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates are Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. Venezuela and Argentina were hyperinflationary for all periods presented, and Turkey became hyperinflationary e/ffective May 1, 2022, requiring retroactive implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1, 2022. The impacts of applying IAS 29 were not significant in all years presented.\n\nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign currency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets,\n\ncommitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge.\n\nNet investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries are long-term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. The Group has designated a certain portion of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds, maturing in 2028, as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain of these net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. As of December 31, 2022, long-term financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR/uni00A01.8 billion (USD/uni00A02.0 billion; December 31, 2021: USD 2.1 billion), has been designated as a hedge instrument. During 2022, USD/uni00A091 million of net of taxes unrealized income (2021: USD 216 million) was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects in relation with this net investment hedge. The hedge remained e/ffective since inception, and no amount was recognized in the consolidated income statement in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Group has only a very limited exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Group's businesses. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a specific business, but generally by not more than 10% of the margin and thus below the Group's risk management tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Group does not enter into significant commodity futures, forward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group addresses its net exposure to interest rate risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges  periodic   payments  based  on  a  notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe Group may purchase equities as investments of its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unrelated company to less than 5% of its liquid funds. Potential investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options are written on equities that the Group owns, and put options are written on equities that the Group wants to buy and for which cash is available.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Group periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit insurance and factoring).\n\nThe provisions for expected credit losses for customers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade",

        "page_content": "receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables.\n\nIn measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due. In determining the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors that may a/ffect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss rates for each category of customers.\n\nThe Group's largest customer accounted for approximately 16% of net sales to third parties, and the second largest and third largest customers accounted for 11% and 7% of net sales to third parties, respectively (2021: 17%, 11% and 6%, respectively; 2020: 17%, 11% and 6%, respectively).\n\nThe highest amounts of trade receivables outstanding were for these same three customers and amounted to 16%, 14% and 7%, respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2022 (2021: 16%, 12% and 7%, respectively). There is no other significant concentration of customer credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities and money market instruments; credit risk on cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settlement risk for di/fferent instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only buying securities that are at least A- rated. Counterparty credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and kept within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, reverse repurchasing agreements are contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. To further reduce the settlement risk, the Group has implemented a multi-currency payment system, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), providing multilateral netting (payment-versus-payment settlement)  of  cash  flows  from  foreign  exchange transactions.\n\nThe Group's cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions; the three largest\n\nones hold approximately 13.2%, 9.2% and 6.8%, respectively (2021: 9.7%, 9.7% and 7.6%, respectively). As of December 31, 2021, the Group's cash and cash equivalents also included short-term highly rated government-backed debt securities, with an original maturity of three months or less, for approximately 16% (2022: nil).\n\nThe Group does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties and does not have any significant grouping of exposures to financial sector or country risk.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group could not be able to settle or meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Group Treasury is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related processes and policies, are overseen by management. Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis according to business needs and tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numerous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility.\n\nCertain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.\n\nManagement monitors the Group's net debt or liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.\n\nNovartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD/uni00A09.0 billion in the aggregate  of  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes. Novartis also has one Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY/uni00A0 150 billion (approximately USD/uni00A01.1 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commercial paper notes totaling USD/uni00A02.8 billion under these three programs were outstanding as per December 31, 2022 (2021: USD/uni00A00.9 billion). Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD/uni00A06.0 billion, which was extended in September 2022. This credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks and is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper programs. The facility matures in September 2025 and was undrawn as per December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.",

In managing its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, Moody's Investors Service rated the Company A1 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S&P Global Ratings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term maturities.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to provide quantitative information about market risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with the Group's financial risk management policy, and are based on a one-parameter risk model that considers a one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and",

They consider aggregated risk exposures arising from the most significant risk factors (currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk) and include all financial assets and financial liabilities as set forth in the table on page F-64.\n\nThe disclosures below illustrate the potential impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as a result of hypothetical market movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. The range of variables chosen reflects management's view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity\n\nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar against these currencies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have a/ffected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in these foreign currencies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar would have impacted the Group's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                  | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| /five.tab/percent.tab increase in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | - /six.tab                          | /three.tab                          |\n| /five.tab/percent.tab decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | /seven.tab                          | - /three.tab                        |\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group designated EUR 1.8 billion (December 31, 2021: EUR 1.8 billion) of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase, or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar, without considering the translation e/ffect of these net investments, would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                  | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| /five.tab/percent.tab increase in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | /nine.tab/three.tab                 | /nine.tab/nine.tab                  |\n| /five.tab/percent.tab decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   against USD | - /nine.tab/eight.tab               | - /one.tab/zero.tab/four.tab        |\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nOur portfolio of fixed-income instruments as of December 31, 2022, was mainly composed of time deposits and debt securities.\n\nNovartis uses duration models to approximate the possible change in the value of fixed-income instruments. Based on these models, management believes that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a reasonable possible change over a one-year period.\n\nBased on exposures in 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would  not  have  resulted  in  a  significant  increase (decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instruments.  In  addition,  a  hypothetical  100-basis  point increase (decrease) in interest rates would not have resulted in a material increase (decrease) of cash flows attributable to such fixed-income instruments.\n\nThe vast majority of our outstanding financial debts are straight bonds with fixed interest rates and are therefore not a/ffected by movements in interest rates.\n\n## Equity price sensitivity\n\nFund investments and equity securities held by the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss.\n\nThe fair value of these fund investments and equity securities was USD 1.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: USD 2.2 billion). The fair values of these investments are impacted by the volatility of the stock market, valuation parameters applied (for nonlisted equities) and changes in general economic factors. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab increase in equity prices | /one.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab          | /one.tab/five.tab/four.tab          |\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab decrease in equity prices | - /one.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab        | - /one.tab/five.tab/four.tab        |\n\nA hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab increase in equity prices | /one.tab/two.tab/four.tab           | /one.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab         |\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab decrease in equity prices | - /one.tab/two.tab/four.tab         | - /one.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab       |",

Our responsibilities under  those  provisions  and  standards  are  further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants  (including  International  Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n- \u00b7  Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio and Xiidra intangible assets\n- \u00b7 Provisions for deductions from revenue related to Innovative Medicines US Managed Care, Medicare Part/uni00A0D and Medicaid rebate programs\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio and Xiidra intangible assets\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group determined the recoverable amount of the intangible assets other than goodwill based on the fair value less costs of disposal method for which no directly observable market inputs were available. As discussed in Note 11, the Group has intangible assets in its Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill totaling USD 29'826 million as at December 31, 2022, a portion of which related to the currently marketed products Leqvio and Xiidra .\n\nWe identified the assessment of the recoverable amount, specifically the sales forecasts of the Leqvio and Xiidra intangible assets, as a Key Audit Matter. Significant auditor judgment and subjectivity was required to assess the sales forecasts assumptions which were a significant input in the determination of the recoverable amount of these intangible assets.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this Key Audit Matter:\n\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of a certain internal control related to the Group's intangible asset impairment process for Leqvio and Xiidra , including the development of the sales forecasts;\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the reasonableness of management's sales forecasts for Leqvio and Xiidra by (1) comparing certain underlying assumptions to company-specific operational information and management's communications to the board of directors, (2) comparing the most  recent  sales  performance  to  previous  drug launches,  and  (3)  comparing  certain  underlying assumptions to available external market and industry data; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's ability to accurately forecast sales by comparing historical sales forecasts for Leqvio and Xiidra to actual results.\n\nFor further information on the assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio and Xiidra intangible assets refer to the following:\n\nPage F-6 (Note 1 Significant accounting policies), Page F-17 (Note 3 Segmentation of key figures 2022, 2021 and 2020) and Page F-33 (Note 11 Goodwill and intangible assets)",

        "page_content": "## Provisions for deductions from revenue related to Innovative Medicines US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group records provisions for estimated rebates as a deduction from revenue when the related revenue  is  recognized.  Rebates  involve  the  use  of assumptions and judgements in the determination of the provision rates at the time revenues are recorded. Provision rates are influenced by the terms and conditions in the individual agreements, historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population growth, product pricing, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, contracts, and channels and payers. As discussed in Note 22, provisions for deductions from revenue totaled USD 6'732 million as at December 31, 2022, a portion of which related to Innovative Medicines US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs (hereafter 'IM US rebates').\n\nWe identified the estimation of the IM US rebates provisions, specifically the provision rebate rates, as a Key Audit Matter. The evaluation of the provision rebate rates required a high degree of subjective auditor judgment as it involved estimating the portion of the Group's revenue which will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary audit procedures we performed to address this Key Audit Matter:\n\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of certain internal controls over the Group's IM US rebates process related to the development of the provision rebate rates;\n- \u00b7 We developed our own independent expectation of the IM US rebates provisions, by using internal information, including historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid, and comparing it to management's actual recorded balances;\n- \u00b7  For a sample of actual rebate claims processed by the Group, we evaluated the claims against the contractual and mandated terms of the rebate arrangements; and\n- \u00b7  We assessed management's ability to accurately estimate the IM US rebates provisions by comparing historically recorded provisions to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Group.\n\nFor further information on the provisions for deductions from revenue related to Innovative Medicines US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs refer to the following:\n\nPage F-6 (Note 1 Significant accounting policies), Page F-17 (Note 3 Segmentation of key figures 2022, 2021 and 2020), Page F-38 (Note 15 Trade receivables) and Page F-48 (Note 22 Provisions and other current liabilities)\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 were audited by\n\nanother auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on February 1, 2022.\n\n## Other Information in the Annual/uni00A0Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the company, the compensation report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the Annual Report and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and SA/hyphen.capCH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors, primarily through the Audit and Compliance Committee, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS/hyphen.capCH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated  financial  statements  according  to  the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRichard Broadbelt Licensed Audit Expert Auditor in charge\n\nBasel, January 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSara Burke",

Introduction\n\nThe financial statements of Novartis AG, with its registered o/ffice in Basel, comply with the requirements of the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).\n\n## 2. Accounting policies\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nCurrent assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted at year-end exchange rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unreali zed exchange losses arising from these as well as those from business transactions, are recorded net as financial income or financial expenses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. These instruments are valued at fair value. When di/fferent accounting policies apply for the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument, hedge  accounting is applied through measuring the hedged item together with the derivative financial instrument.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are valued at acquisition cost less adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other impairment of value.\n\nNovartis AG is presenting consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. Therefore, Novartis AG has applied the exemption included in article 961d, paragraph 1 SCO, and has not prepared additional disclosures, a separate cash flow statement and a management report for SCO purposes.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are initially recognized at cost. Investments in Novartis Group subsidiaries are assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted to their recoverable amount within their category.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at maturity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that is due to be paid.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made to cover general business risks of the Group.",

No treasury share sales were executed during 2022 and 2021. Share-based compensation transactions totaled 9.7 million shares (2021: 9.9 million shares).\n\nThe number of treasury shares held by the Company and its subsidiaries meet the definitions and requirements of article 659b SCO. As at December 31, 2022, treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its fully-owned subsidiaries totaled 185 080 017. It should be noted that within the Novartis Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements, some Novartis entities are included in the consolidation scope. These entities are mainly foundations, which as at December 31, 2022 did not qualify as subsidiaries in the sense of article 659b SCO.\n\nWith e/ffective date of January 1, 2023, article 659b SCO was amended to change the definition of subsidiaries to include foundations of the Company. /uni00A0 This change will have the impact as of January 1, 2023 to increase the reported number of treasury shares held by subsidiaries to reflect the Company foundations' Novartis AG shares held (January 1, 2023: 96 969 226).\n\nAs of the entry into force of the revised Swiss corporate law on January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held by Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis will no longer carry the right to vote and therefore will be included as treasury shares for determining compliance with the legal requirements for legal reserves under articles 659 et. seq. and 663b.10 SCO for the treasury shares.\n\nFor further information related to the amendment to SCO article 659b, see Note 10.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe financial statements of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2021 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on February 1, 2022.\n\n## Other Information in the Annual Report\n\ndoes not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the Company, the  compensation  report  and  our  auditor's  reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information in the Annual Report and we do  not  express  any  form  of  assurance  conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA/hyphen.capCH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but",

        "page_content": "As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA/hyphen.capCH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors, primarily through the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other\n\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS/hyphen.capCH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRichard Broadbelt Licensed Audit expert\n\nNorman Dittes Licensed Audit Expert\n\nAuditor in Charge\n\nBasel, January 31, 2023",
