'\n\nRoy Jakobs CEO Royal Philips\n\n## Dear Stakeholder,\n\nPhilips is a company with strong market leadership positions, an extensive customer base, strong innovation portfolio, talented employees, and a global purpose-driven brand. Yet, as our 2022 performance underlines, we are not extracting the full value of our businesses and have disappointed many stakeholders.\n\nMy priority as CEO is to address operational challenges, improve performance, and drive progressive value creation through a strategy of focused organic growth and an innovation model shift to increase the impact of patient- and people-centric innovation at scale. Execution will be the key value driver, with three clear priorities around improving patient safety and quality, creating more reliable and resilient supply chains, and simplifying the way we work, so we are more agile and competitive.\n\n## Addressing priority challenges - improved execution as key value driver\n\nOur first priority is to rebuild Philips' reputation around patient safety and quality. The recall of specific Respironics sleep therapy devices and ventilators let down the patients who depended on them, and the doctors caring for those patients. We apologize deeply for that and are working hard to restore trust with all stakeholders. By year-end, following the substantial ramp-up of capacity, Philips Respironics had completed around 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients.\n\nIn consultation with regulators around the world, we have also been conducting a comprehensive test and research program to better understand the potential health risks associated with the use of affected devices. I am very conscious that 18 months is long, but this work had to be done thoroughly. I am encouraged by the test results for the firstgeneration DreamStation devices, that account for over two thirds of the registered affected devices: the prevalence of visible foam degradation is low, and the emission of the detected volatile organic compounds and particulates are within the applicable safety limits and not expected to result in appreciable harm to health in patients.\n\nWe are fully committed to completing the Respironics recall and testing program in 2023.\n\nWe will also implement all measures agreed with the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and US Department of Justice, including a consent decree, and rebuild ties with the FDA and other national regulators. We have put the leadership and end-to-end organization in place and have invested significantly in doing so. Across the company, we have assigned the highest priority to making the necessary step-up in patient safety and quality management and have elevated leadership of patient safety and quality to Executive Committee level.\n\nAn integral aspect of quality is the ability to deliver and install equipment on time and to the required specifications. To this end, we are taking decisive action to make our supply chain more reliable and predictable, by securing near-term supply, redesigning and pruning our portfolio, and moving from a 'one size fits all' supply chain structure to a more agile, tailored value chain model per business, with dedicated and upgraded domain expertise. This will secure more deliveries, drive faster order-book conversion and build down inventory.\n\nWe are also simplifying the way we work to drive accountability and agility, with the aim of unlocking significant productivity and margin gains. This simplification - with end-to-end businesses with single accountability and more focused targets, supported by a much leaner enterprise layer, strong regions and a reinvigorated culture of patient- and people-centricity, innovation impact and clear accountability - is a primary enabler to drive flawless execution.\n\nThe set of measures we have taken includes the very difficult, yet necessary decisions announced in October 2022 and January 2023 to reduce our workforce by 4,000 employees and then a further 6,000 respectively, as we drive a major step-up in productivity. We will strive to implement these reductions with due respect for every employee affected and in line with all local rules and regulations.\n\nWe believe that, together, these measures will help us establish the culture, capabilities and infrastructure needed to consistently execute and deliver as a reliable patient- and peoplecentric health technology company.",

To do this, we will drive organic growth through scale and leadership:\n\n- \u00b7 Focusing investments to accelerate growth in Image Guided Therapy, Ultrasound and Monitoring, where we have strong #1 or #2 positions, and expand our leadership position in Personal Health\n- \u00b7 Scaling our new Enterprise Informatics business\n- \u00b7 Driving margin improvement in Diagnostic Imaging\n- \u00b7 Restoring the Sleep & Respiratory Care business.\n\nWe will leverage our distinctive market positions, especially our strong presence in North America and many international markets, while further localizing to support our leadership position in China.\n\n## Patient- and people-centric innovation at scale\n\nWe will continue to invest significantly in innovation, but are making a number of important changes to increase the impact of our patient- and people-driven innovation. Focusing our resources on fewer, better-resourced and more impactful projects, we will concentrate a higher proportion of our R&D resources in the businesses to ensure that innovation is done closer to our customers. We will scale and accelerate innovations, driven by the business and supported by rightsized corporate research, with patient safety, quality and sustainability at the core of innovation design. The technological and business model innovation that Philips brings to healthcare across care settings - often as part of long-term partnerships - is critical, making care delivery more convenient and sustainable.\n\n## 2022 performance\n\nLooking back on last year, sales increased nominally to EUR 17.8 billion, while several factors weighed down on profitability. Performance was impacted by our efforts to mitigate supply chain and inflationary pressures and the revenue and cost consequences of the Philips Respironics sleep recall, whilst at the same time dealing with global challenges such as the COVID situation in China, volatile demand and supply, and the war in Ukraine. As we worked through the operational challenges, we progressed on our execution priorities in the fourth quarter and saw initial signs of improvement.\n\nI find it greatly encouraging that, despite our recent difficulties, Philips' purpose, strategy and solutions resonate strongly with customers, as evidenced by the around 100 long-term strategic partnerships we entered into with hospitals and health systems around the world in 2022, and by the continued strength of our order book.\n\n## Delivering on our ESG commitments\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance (ESG) are three key dimensions defining our approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. In 2022, we reached 1.81 billion people with our products and services, including 202 million in underserved communities - taking us a step closer to our goal of improving 2 billion lives per year by 2025, including 300 million in underserved communities.\n\nWe continued to work hard to deliver on our other key ESG commitments. For example, our updated carbon reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and we were included in CDP's climate action 'A-List' for the 10 th year in a row. We see increasing momentum within the healthcare industry and on the part of our customers to reduce their environmental impact, and we are well placed - with innovations such as our BlueSeal magnet for helium-free-for-life MR and our Circular portfolio - to support that trend and help create a sustainable infrastructure for the future of healthcare.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe remain cautious in light of the subdued economic outlook for the year, staffing and inflationary pressures facing our customers, geopolitical risks, supply and demand volatility, and uncertainties around ongoing consent decree negotiations, litigation and Department of Justice investigations. Nevertheless, we expect that, by prioritizing patient safety and quality, tightening our focus on innovation and strengthening our category leadership areas, while at the same time improving execution and taking a disciplined approach to capital, we will be able to progressively create value with sustainable impact. Against this background, and reflecting the importance we attach to dividend stability, we propose to maintain the dividend at EUR 0.85 per share, to be distributed in shares.\n\nOn behalf of the Executive Committee, I would like to acknowledge, once again, that 2022 has been very disappointing and we carry accountability for the plan to bring Philips back to where it belongs. I want to thank our customers and their patients for their understanding and our suppliers and ecosystem partners for their support - over this past year. I appreciate our employees' hard work and willingness to embrace change and drive performance improvement. And I wish to thank our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support in these challenging times.\n\nI am honored to have been tasked with leading our company and am heartened by the support I have encountered from our employees and customers, investors and other stakeholders. I am realistic about the challenges we face, but have full confidence in our plan of action and am firm in my resolve to lead Philips back to a position of strength in a world that needs meaningful innovation.\n\n## Roy Jakobs\n\nChief Executive Officer",

As a result, we are active in highly attractive segments that offer significant potential for growth and margin expansion.\n\nThese markets are attractive due to the underlying growth of demand for access to healthcare from an aging and growing population. This in turn fuels the need for meaningful innovation to address the rising healthcare spending and staff shortages and make healthcare more efficient and productive, while driving better outcomes.\n\nAt Philips, we view the provision and collection of data from patient monitors, imaging devices, and Electronic Medical Records as the foundation upon which Artificial Intelligence (AI) propositions can be built to turn clinical data into actionable insights for patients, providers, and consumers. In addition to providing clinical insights, the same system, informatics and service solutions also provide improved operational forecasting - something our customers have been requesting since COVID-19 to help them improve productivity.\n\nWhen we perform all of the above for a particular health condition, such as cardiac disease, we establish domain expertise across various sites of care for that disease state. Our healthcare customers are asking for integrated innovations that enable them to care for patients both in the hospital and in outpatient settings. In parallel we continue to provide impactful consumer health propositions.\n\n## Creating value with sustainable impact\n\n2022 was a difficult year for Philips as its business and financial performance suffered due to challenges in execution, quality and supply, and a complex operating model. Going forward, Philips will address these operational challenges, improve performance, and drive progressive value creation through a strategy of a) focused organic growth, b) scalable patient- and people-centric innovation, and c) focus on reliable execution, prioritizing patient safety and quality, supply chain reliability, and a simplified operating model. All supported by a reinvigorated culture of accountability, empowerment and strengthened health technology talent and capabilities.\n\n## Focused organic growth\n\nHaving transformed to become a health technology company in recent years, we will now focus on extracting the full value of our strong portfolio with leading positions.\n\nWe will focus investments to accelerate growth and margin expansion in areas - Image Guided Therapy, Ultrasound, Monitoring, and Personal Health - where we have strong #1 or #2 positions. In 2022, approximately 70% of our sales were generated by businesses with such leadership positions in the hospital and the home. We will also scale our new Enterprise Informatics business, drive margin improvement in Diagnostic Imaging, and restore Sleep & Respiratory Care.\n\n## Scalable patient- and people-centric innovation\n\nPhilips' purpose - to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation - is at the center of everything we do. This core principle has never been more relevant than it is in these challenging times. As a leading health technology company, we believe that - viewed through the lens of customer needs - patient- and people-centric innovation can improve people's health and healthcare outcomes, as well as making care more convenient and sustainable, both in the hospital and at home.\n\nGiven our global presence, strong enterprise informatics platforms, (ambulatory) monitoring and imaging data, as well as our capabilities to support care across settings, we believe Philips is well positioned to do this, and - leveraging our strong clinical, consumer and Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) franchise, and our strong brand - do it in a convenient and sustainable way.\n\nIn the consumer domain, we develop innovative solutions that support healthier lifestyles, prevent disease, and help people to live well with chronic illness, also in the home and community settings.\n\nIn clinics and hospitals, we are teaming up with healthcare providers to innovate and transform the way care is delivered. We listen closely to our customers' needs and together we co-create solutions that help our customers improve outcomes, patient and staff experience and productivity. We are embedding AI and data science in our propositions for instance, applying the power of predictive data analytics and artificial intelligence at the point of care - to leverage the value of data in the clinical and operational domains, aiding clinical decision making and improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare services. Increasingly, we are working together with our health systems customers in novel business",

To improve outcomes, we will support clinical workflows in areas where we have domain leadership, e.g. cardiology and the ICU. To increase productivity in a system having to contend with high patient volumes, staff shortages and rising costs, we will enhance care pathways and operational workflows through integrated technology infrastructure, and we will leverage our (enterprise) informatics and hardware innovation to lower costs and reduce the burden on staff. To improve the delivery of care outside the hospital, we will utilize our consumer/home experience and our strength in data and informatics to connect and support care for patients, with better outcomes, across settings.\n\nIn doing so, we will leverage leading technologies across our portfolio. To name just a handful, by way of example: our Ingenia Ambition MR system with BlueSeal magnet that offers helium-free-for-life operation; our Azurion suite of interventional cardiology solutions; our IntelliVue MX750 and MX850 patient monitors and MCOT ambulatory cardiac ePatch offering comprehensive monitoring capabilities across sites of care; and our multivendor, multi-modality, multi-site Radiology Operations Command Center virtualized imaging solution.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significantly in innovation, we are making a number of important changes to increase the impact of our patient- and people-driven innovation and generate better returns. Moving forward, we will focus our resources on a smaller number of projects and products with greater potential for impact. We will scale and accelerate innovations, driven by the business and supported by rightsized Group research, with patient safety, quality and sustainability at the core of design. By bringing our central innovation activities into the heart of the businesses, we are bringing our system and software innovation closer to our customers.\n\n## Focus on improved execution\n\nThe key driver for our performance improvement is improved execution grounded in three decisive actions:\n\n- 1. patient safety and quality: putting this at the heart of (business) innovation, elevating the function to Executive Committee level, and embedding it in our culture, e.g. by giving all employees dedicated patient safety and quality objectives;\n- 2. supply chain reliability: moving from a centralized 'one size fits all' supply chain structure to a more agile, dedicated end-to-end set-up per business, and pruning and redesigning products;\n- 3. a simplified operating model: end-to-end businesses with single accountability working in a leaner, more agile way, guided by patient- and people-centricity and accountable leadership with empowered teams.\n\n## Our ambition\n\nWith our global reach, market leadership positions, deep clinical and technological insights, and customer-centric, patient- and people-focused innovation capability, we believe Philips is well placed to create further value in a changing health and care world.\n\nWe aim to improve the lives of 2 billion people a year by 2025, including 300 million in underserved communities, rising to 2.5 billion and 400 million respectively by 2030. This is one of the comprehensive set of commitments we have deployed across all the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions that help guide the execution of our strategy and support our contribution to UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ), 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nWe strive to deliver superior, long-term value to patients, customers, consumers and shareholders, while acting responsibly towards our planet and society, in partnership with our stakeholders. We believe that, executed with rigor, discipline and quality, the strategic imperatives outlined above, in combination with a relentless focus on execution, will put us back on track for a future of progressive value creation with sustainable impact.",

We do this through a multi-stakeholder process. Assessing these topics enables us to prioritize and focus upon the most material topics and effectively address these in our policies, programs and targets. We do this with reference to the GRI standard and identify and assess impacts on an ongoing basis, for example through discussions with our customers, suppliers, investors, employees, peer companies, social partners, regulators, NGOs, and academics. We also conduct a benchmark exercise, carry out trend analysis and run media searches to provide input for our materiality analysis. GRI has not yet published a sector standard for the healthcare industry. Philips' impact on society at large is covered through our Lives Improved metric and the Environmental Profit & Loss account, as well as a number of other KPIs addressed in Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 45.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimilar to 2021, we used an evidence-based approach to materiality analysis, powered by a third-party AI-based application. The application allows automated sifting and analysis of millions of data points from publicly available sources, including corporate reports, mandatory regulations and voluntary initiatives, as well as news. In our 2022 materiality analysis, we identified a list of topics that are material to our businesses. With this datadriven approach to materiality analysis we have incorporated a wider range of data and stakeholders than was ever possible before and managed to get an evidence-based perspective on regulatory, strategic and reputational risks and opportunities. Topics were prioritized through a survey sent to a large and diverse set of internal and external stakeholders, combined with input from the application.\n\nPublic health risks emerged as a new material topic in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was assessed as a material topic in 2022 as well.\n\n## Changes in 2022\n\nOn the external importance axis, the most significant increases compared to 2021 were Sustainable value creation, Geopolitical events, Responsible and Resilient Supply Chains, Talent & development, and Energy efficiency. On the internal importance axis, there were significant increases on Pollution, Governance, Access to (quality and affordable) care, Competition & market access, and Talent & development.\n\n## Double materiality\n\nAfter completing the regular materiality analysis, we completed a preliminary 'double materiality' analysis, in preparation for the upcoming requirements of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The double materiality analysis addresses both financial materiality (the impact of society on Philips) as well as impact materiality (the impact of Philips on society): we only included the high and medium material topics listed above. The data sources used for the financial materiality include corporate reports, mandatory regulations with sanctions, voluntary initiatives by e.g. central banks, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) accounting metrics. For impact materiality, we included sustainability data from corporate reports or sustainability reports, coverage in the news and voluntary initiatives and regulation. The results of the double materiality analysis are depicted below.",

We are also innovating the way we engage with our customers, using new business models across different care settings, including out-of-hospital settings such as office-based labs and ambulatory surgical centers, which offer clear clinical, financial and operational benefits.\n\nIn 2022, Philips completed the acquisition of Vesper Medical Inc. a US-based medical technology company that develops minimally-invasive peripheral vascular devices. Vesper Medical will further expand Philips' portfolio of diagnostic and therapeutic devices with an advanced venous stent portfolio for the treatment of deep venous disease.\n\nIn 2022, the Diagnosis & Treatment segment consisted of the following areas of business:\n\n- \u00b7 Diagnostic Imaging : Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), with helium-free-for-life operations, bundled with associated software to streamline workflows, optimize diagnostic quality, and improve patient experience; X-ray systems, together with associated software to streamline workflows and optimize diagnostic quality; advanced and efficient Computed Tomography (CT) systems and software, including detectorbased Spectral CT and molecular and hybrid imaging solutions for nuclear medicine\n- \u00b7 Ultrasound : echography solutions focused on diagnosis, treatment planning and guidance for cardiology, general imaging, obstetrics/gynecology, and point-of-care applications, as well as proprietary software capabilities to enable advanced diagnostics and interventions, and remote capabilities to enable tele-ultrasound operations and training\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Diagnostic Informatics : a suite of integrated multivendor products and services that deliver a comprehensive platform designed to connect clinical data and optimize workflows around every step in the patient's journey across a range of diagnostic (radiology, point-of-care, laboratory) and clinical (oncology, cardiology, neurology) service lines\n- \u00b7 Image Guided Therapy: integrated interventional systems that combine information from imaging systems, interventional devices, navigation tools and patient health records to provide interventional staff with the control and information they need to perform procedures efficiently; interventional diagnostic and therapeutic devices to treat coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment\n\n## Total sales by business\n\n|                                   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| Diagnostic Imaging                | 41%    |\n| Ultrasound                        | 18%    |\n| Enterprise Diagnostic Informatics | 8%     |\n| Image Guided Therapy              | 33%    |\n\nRevenue is predominantly earned through the sale of products, leasing, customer services fees, recurring per-procedure fees for disposable devices, and software license fees. For certain offerings, per-study fees or outcome-based fees are earned over the contract term.\n\nSales channels are a mix of a direct sales force, especially in all the larger markets, third-party distributors and an online sales portal. This varies by product, market and price segment. Our sales organizations have an intimate knowledge of technologies and clinical applications, as well as the solutions necessary to solve problems for our customers.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, sales at Philips' Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are generally higher in the second half of the year, largely due to the timing of customer spending patterns.\n\nAt year-end 2022, Diagnosis & Treatment had around 33,000 employees worldwide.\n\n## 2022 business highlights\n\nPhilips received FDA clearance to market its new 7700 3.0T MR system, which features an enhanced gradient system for Philips' highest image quality to support a precision diagnosis.

Based on Philips Azurion, this solution enhances the accuracy of biopsy procedures and provides a therapy option for immediate treatment of early-stage lung cancer patients.\n\nInferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters are used to treat patients with venous thromboembolism, in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the leg and groin and can travel through the circulatory system, but research has shown that they may have long-term complications. In the United States, the first patients were successfully treated for Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter removal using Philips' CavaClear solution - the only FDA-cleared solution for advanced IVC filter removal.\n\n## Connected Care businesses in 2022 3.4.2\n\nThe Connected Care businesses aim to connect and elevate care for all. Philips connects patients and caregivers across care settings, delivering clinical, operational and therapeutic solutions that help our customers address the Quadruple Aim of better health outcomes, improved patient and staff experience, and lower cost of care. After the years of the COVID pandemic, which has accelerated the digital transformation of healthcare, in 2022 the volatile global economic situation put additional pressure on customer budgets and worsened trends such as staff shortages, as well as increasing the need for solutions that enable more effective, sustainable and convenient care in hospital, clinics and the home.\n\nPhilips' Sleep & Respiratory Care business in particular faced multiple operational, regulatory and supply-chain challenges in 2022, but action has been taken to address these through the decision to establish Sleep & Respiratory Care as an organization with end-to-end accountability, spanning product creation through to customer fulfillment (pending the outcome of consultation with workers councils in a number of countries). There has been a\n\nreset to put patient safety front and center in everything we do, and we believe that the implementation of a new simplified organization, which began in 2022, will help to achieve this, as well as to improve productivity and increase agility. For information about the Philips Respironics recall and remediation effort, please refer to Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70.\n\nWith clinical depth and discovery, Philips Connected Care technologies help to cultivate a more accurate and complete view of the patient that drives better health and care. The combination of advanced technological solutions and a consultative approach allows Philips to be an effective partner to its customers in their digital transformation, both across the enterprise and at the level of the individual clinician, nurse and patient. The role of Connected Care is to collect, connect, analyze and communicate data to provide insights and clinical decision support that help to improve outcomes and drive productivity.\n\nTo help enable care delivery across the health continuum and help our customers embrace healthcare's digital transformation, the Connected Care businesses continue to step up platform investments that span three key domains:\n\n- \u00b7 Acute Patient Management: in-hospital continuous monitoring and workflow solutions fueled by advanced interoperability and patient data insights\n- \u00b7 Ambulatory Patient Care Management: ambulatory and home-based monitoring and diagnosis solutions and services supporting the patient journey\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Informatics Management: turning data insights into decision support and productivity tools.\n\nPhilips' platforms aggregate and leverage information from clinical devices, patient and historical data to support care providers in patient engagement, diagnostics, (ambulatory) patient monitoring and (clinical) therapy solutions.\n\nIn January 2022, Philips completed the acquisition of Cardiologs, a France-based medical technology company focused on transforming cardiac diagnostics using artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technology. Cardiologs is already further strengthening Philips' cardiac monitoring and diagnostics offering with innovative software technology, electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis and reporting services.",

Leveraging a strong presence in the intensive care unit (ICU), Hospital Patient Monitoring solutions enhance customers' experience and improve patient outcomes with seamless patient data monitoring from admission to discharge, and by turning patient data into clinical insights that are actionable at the right time and specific to targeted care settings.\n- \u00b7 Emergency Care : Emergency Care propositions play a critical role in connected acute care management, both inside and outside the hospital, including cardiac resuscitation (e.g. AEDs) and emergency care solutions (devices, services, and digital/data solutions) for professional and consumer applications.\n- \u00b7 Sleep & Respiratory Care : Working closely with clinical partners and Durable/Home Medical Equipment providers, Philips Respironics provides sleep and respiratory solutions to customers, clinicians and patients. This extends from ambulatory patient care solutions for obstructive sleep apnea, to solutions encompassing diagnostics, people-centric therapy, cloud-based connected propositions and care management services for patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and respiratory conditions. Hospital Respiratory Care provides invasive and non-invasive ventilators for acute and sub-acute hospital environments; Home Respiratory Care supports chronic care management in the home.\n- \u00b7 Connected Care Informatics: Comprised of three core business units, this business focuses on clinical analytics solutions that provide actionable insights to optimize patient data.\n\nThe fully integrated Electronic Medical Record & Care Management business enables centralized management of clinical, organizational and operational processes, and virtual care delivery propositions, including remote patient management and real-time monitoring in acute care. The Tele-ICU program continues to play a pivotal role, enabling clinicians and nursing staff to remotely monitor a scalable number of ICU beds from a central monitoring facility with predictive analytics, enabled by Philips' HealthSuite Platform.\n\nThe Clinical Data Services business - formerly Capsule Technologies, acquired by Philips in early 2021 - offers medical device and data integration across the enterprise for continuous, vendor-neutral data capture from more than 1,000 device models supported by insightful clinical decision support and analysis.\n\nOur Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics business - comprised of BioTelemetry, which Philips acquired in 2021 - provides industry-leading patient care management in ambulatory and home care settings in North America and beyond through a suite of\n\ncardiac diagnostic and monitoring solutions to identify heart rhythm disorders supported by AI algorithms that orchestrate workflows and services across care settings. The acquisition of Cardiologs complements this capability with a vendor-neutral heart disorder screener and ECG analysis applications, based on machine learning algorithms.\n\n## Connected Care\n\n## Total sales by business\n\n|                             | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Hospital Patient Monitoring | 47%    |\n| Emergency Care              | 5%     |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care    | 28%    |\n| Connected Care Informatics  | 20%    |\n\nIn most of the Connected Care businesses, revenue is earned through the sale of products and solutions, customer services fees and software license fees. Where bundled offerings result in solutions for our customers, or offerings are based on the number of people being monitored, we see more usage-based earnings models. In the patient care management businesses (Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics and Sleep & Respiratory Care), revenue is generated through clinical services, product sales and through rental models, whereby revenue is generated over time.\n\nSales channels include a mix of a direct salesforce, partly paired with an online sales portal and distributors (varying by product, market and price segment). Sales are mostly driven by a direct salesforce with an intimate knowledge of the procedures that use our integrated solutions' smart devices, systems, software and services. Philips works with customers and partners to co-create solutions, drive commercial innovation and adapt to new models such as monitoring-as-a-service and software-as-a-service.\n\nSales at Philips' Connected Care businesses are generally higher in the second half of the year, largely due to customer spending patterns. However, the Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business in June 2021 had a negative impact on sales throughout 2022.\n\nAt year-end 2022, Connected Care had around 17,000 employees worldwide.",

Having met our goal of bringing our site-related CO\u2082 emissions under 35 kilotons per year in 2020, we further reduced our CO\u2082 emissions to 25 kilotons in 2022. In addition, we reached 77% renewable energy in 2022, already exceeding our target of 75% by 2025. Anticipating the higher cost of energy for 2023, we redoubled our efforts on energy-saving measures. Combined with portfolio optimization, this resulted in a 5.3% reduction in 2022 total energy consumption compared to 2020 and 2021.\n\nOver 75% of our locations are leased properties, and we manage vacancy closely to ensure the right level of space efficiency and flexibility to support our business dynamic. Our current facilities are adequate to meet the requirements of our present and foreseeable future operations. As expected, occupancy rates in our offices continued to be low in the first half of 2022 in the aftermath of COVID-19. In the second half of 2022 we saw occupancy stabilizing and we are currently evaluating options to right-size our office footprint, to further adopt task-based working principles, and to cater for meaningful presence in inspiring layout and workplace solutions. The net book value of our land and buildings as of December 31, 2022, represented EUR 1,336 million; construction in progress represented EUR 23 million.\n\n## Our geographies 3.5\n\n## Our Markets 3.5.1\n\nWe address North America, Western Europe and other mature geographies, as well as Greater China and other growth geographies, via three market groups - North America, Greater China and International Markets - which are active in more than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nThe Markets' core objective is to understand local market/customer needs, to create and activate the local marketing plans, to develop and manage the relationship with existing and new customers, and to deliver orders. They act as the voice of the customer in the creation of the suite of solutions strategy, bring relevant products and solutions to market, and ensure local (solution) delivery and service execution, as well as managing the (integral) go-to-market approaches to our key customers and indirect channels - all with the aim of maximizing long-term customer value and gaining market share.\n\n## Macro-economic landscape in 2022 3.5.2\n\nIn 2022, global economic activity slowed down compared to 2021, when the global economy rebounded strongly from a COVID-induced recession. Several factors were at play. Firstly, the re-opening of the economy for most of the world in 2021 has disrupted global supply chains. Secondly, previous loose monetary policy, combined with supply chain issues, resulted in strong inflationary pressures commencing towards the end of 2021. Thirdly, to combat high\n\ninflation, central banks around the globe have embarked on aggressive monetary policy tightening cycles. Consequently, global real GDP is estimated to have grown by 3.0% in 2022, compared with the 6.0% estimated in 2021 for 2022. Looking ahead, Oxford Economics expects mild recessions for advanced economies in 2023, with full-year global real GDP growth expected at just 1.3%.\n\n## 2022 highlights from our Market Groups 3.5.3\n\n## North America\n\nIn North America, Philips continues to expand its leadership in long-term strategic partnership, helping health systems like TriHealth, Prisma Health and the University Health System of San Antonio to address interoperability challenges and standardize care across their networks. This includes entering into a 7-year agreement with Northwell Health, the largest healthcare provider in the state of New York, to help standardize patient monitoring, drive interoperability, and lay the foundation for a future-proof, enterprise-wide platform. Moreover, Philips has signed multi-year agreements to continue to expand virtual monitoring and care with the US Department of Defense.\n\nPhilips continues to innovate in its personal health business and has started selling Philips Avent breast pumps via Durable Medical Equipment (DME) providers to give parents the ability to receive breastfeeding equipment and supplies that may be covered by their health insurance. Celebrating 30 years in business in 2022, Philips Sonicare leads the electric rechargeable toothbrush market in the US and Canada and is the most-recommended rechargeable toothbrush brand in the US. Philips Norelco remains the leading electric male grooming brand in the US and Canada, reaching the next generation of young men with our new OneBlade multi-purpose shaver.\n\nPhilips continues to be recognized for its Inclusion and Diversity efforts in North America, including being recognized by Forbes as one of their Best Employers for Diversity and Best Employers for Women.\n\n## Greater China\n\nIn 2022 we continued to provide innovative health technology solutions in support of China's national health strategy, supplying national top hospitals, primary hospitals and private hospitals with tailor-made solutions for their clinical and research needs.\n\nWe partnered with national top hospitals Shanghai Ruijin Hospital and Sichuan Huaxi Hospital on clinical research that leverages our cutting-edge health technologies, and helped the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University establish the largest sleep center in South China by providing consulting services, key equipment and systems. We also provided Zhongshan-Jinshan Diabetic Foot Center with an integrated solution comprised of laser ablation and ultrasound screening technology, and supplied",

And we provided Suzhou Kowloon Hospital with a radiology solution that included Ingenia Elition, Ingenia Ambition, Spectral CT and Azurion 7, and delivered a cardiology and smart hospital solution to Jiangxi Cihuai Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Hospital.\n\nIn the consumer space, in line with the consistent 'Professional, Young and Premium' positioning, we continue to accelerate local innovation to address the specific needs of local consumers. In 2022, locally initiated products generated 20% of revenue. In addition, Philips was recognized as a 'gold brand' (most favored brand of consumers) in the Personal Health category for the third consecutive year by China Business Weekly.\n\nWith the aim of better serving the Chinese market, we established three Philips Innovation Centers in China to focus on 'local-for-local' innovation in systems, products and software, and continue to drive 'made in China' fulfillment for professional medical equipment.\n\n## International Markets\n\nIn our International Markets we strive to execute on a shared global vision whilst meeting the unique local needs and circumstances of our customers. Our goal is to elevate customer relationships and move from being a trusted supplier of equipment, services and software to a transformational partner directly contributing to our customers' long-term success. To support this vision we have made great progress on leveling up our go-to-market model, developing scalable solutions and software, expanding fit-for-future capabilities, reinvesting revenue to enable new business models, and establishing new partnerships.\n\nIn International Markets, Personal Health showed top-line resilience in 2022. Growth was strongest in the Middle East, Turkey & Africa, India and Japan, and overall our growth markets delivered double-digit growth. A major driver of growth in Middle East, Turkey & Africa came from activating GenZ consumers via social media and influencer marketing campaigns on TikTok and other platforms, focusing on relevant GenZ propositions such as OneBlade and Hair Care. In Japan, we successfully launched our latest Shaver series 9000 with SkinIQ technology via a cut-through advertising campaign in Hokkaido and Kanto prefectures. This campaign targeted younger audiences and succeeded in increasing market shares and distribution points.\n\nPhilips entered into many new customer partnerships, including the following:\n\nPhilips entered into partnerships with healthcare providers in the UK and Germany to deliver its vendor-neutral Radiology Operations Command Center, which enables remote collaboration between technologists, radiologists and imaging operations teams across multiple sites, to help increase productivity and expand access to MR- and CT-based diagnosis. In Germany, Philips signed a 10-year partnership agreement with the municipal\n\nhospital St\u00e4dtisches Klinikum Braunschweig, one of the country's largest care providers, to provide monitoring solutions and alarm management. In an interview with a German healthcare magazine, Dr. Andreas Goepfert, CEO Braunschweig Clinic, commented: 'Quality of care is an important aspect that is safeguarded by such a partnership. Nowadays, it is difficult to imagine successful economic operation in the healthcare sector in the medium and long term without technology partners.' In the Netherlands, Philips signed a long-term agreement with the Rijnstate hospital to deliver a wide range of advanced ultrasound devices for 17 different departments at multiple locations of the hospital. The agreement involves ultrasound devices and services for cardiological, vascular or radiological examinations, OB/GYN, as well as mobile devices for the emergency department.\n\nIn Spain, we provided computed tomography, magnetic resonance and image-guided therapy solutions for several Spanish public hospitals as part of INVEAT, an impact initiative driving investment in high-technology equipment in the Spanish national health system. In Finland, Philips signed a 10-year agreement with Oulu University Hospital to deliver the latest Azurion image-guided therapy solutions, as well as maintenance, consultancy and financing services. In the SDA Imaging Center in Chelm, Poland, Philips installed an MR 5300 scanner with Ambient Experience technology, which combines images, sound and light to create an atmosphere that puts patients at ease and reduces the need to redo scans. In Romania, Philips is the trusted partner and supplier of medical equipment and solutions to Transylvania Hospital, a private medical initiative launched in September 2022. The medical technology we provided includes an Azurion 7 biplane angiograph, an Ingenia 3T MR system, and an Affiniti 50 Doppler ultrasound. In Turkey, as part of a project supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we installed 3,400 hospital patient monitors and 437 ultrasound systems across 250 different hospitals within a 4-month window. The Philips team also trained over 3,000 clinicians and monitored usage.\n\nIn Central Asia, we supplied equipment for Kazakhstan's National Research Oncology Center and two multi-modality projects, while in Uzbekistan we won a project to equip Tashkent International Medical Clinic (TIMC) with advanced clinical technology solutions. In a 10-year partnership deal with the Cloud Nine hospital group in India, we connected 257 beds across 26 tele-ICU locations. In addition, some 2,000 Zenition C-arms and 500 Affiniti ultrasound systems were shipped from our manufacturing plant in Chakan.\n\nIn Japan, Philips signed a 10-year agreement with a large university hospital for the expansion of its eICU program for centralized, remote surveillance of high-risk ICU patients. Philips and Thanh Vu Medic Hospital Vietnam signed a 10-year strategic partnership agreement for which Philips is providing state-of-the-art imaging technology, informatics connectivity, 10-year comprehensive service and 5-year structured financing. In Fiji, Philips and Aspen Medical signed a 12-year strategic partnership agreement to supply and integrate diagnostic imaging equipment and services for use in two public hospitals.",

Also in Brazil, a two-year Electronic Medical Record implementation at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Hospitalar do Estado de Minas Gerais (FEHMIG) will integrate 23 public hospitals in the state of Minas Gerais. In Argentina, Philips successfully participated in a tender for a turnkey solution providing high-end imaging equipment for 17 public hospitals. In Mexico, Philips secured a deal with Grupo Angeles to provide an extensive range of Diagnostic Imaging and Image Guided Therapy solutions.\n\n## Supply chain and procurement 3.6\n\n## Integrated Supply Chain 3.6.1\n\nPhilips runs an Integrated Supply Chain (ISC), which encompasses supplier selection and management through procurement, manufacturing across all the industrial sites, logistics and warehousing operations, customer installation, as well as demand/supply orchestration.\n\nWhen selecting and evaluating partners, we consider not only business metrics such as quality, on-time delivery performance and cost, but also environmental, social and governance factors. We use supplier classification models to identify critical suppliers, including those supplying materials, components and services that could influence the safety and performance of our products and solutions.\n\nThe Philips Supplier Quality Manual outlines Philips' quality, regulatory, product, process and customer requirements. The standards outlined in this manual underpin agreements between suppliers and Philips, and guide compliance with Philips' quality standards.\n\n## Addressing immediate challenges\n\n2022 continued to test the resilience of supply chains globally. The Russia-Ukraine war continues to put severe pressure on the commodity landscape and supply chains, and has contributed to the sharp rise in energy and food prices and extreme inflation rates. This came on top of a pre-war environment of low inventories and long lead times, with the accompanying build-up of backlog orders. In addition, the Chinese government's zeroCOVID policy in 2022 again led to outages and supply chain issues. Furthermore, Philips has been hampered by an aging product portfolio with older technology (component designs) and a fragmented supplier landscape. As a result, our lead times to customers suffered, for which we are sorry and are working to take corrective actions.\n\nUnder these market circumstances, the ISC function's priority was to endeavor to safeguard continuity of supply, with dedicated Procurement teams by modalities and types of commodities, so that Philips could continue to provide critical healthcare equipment and solutions to our customers all over the world. For example, we have placed non-cancellable semiconductor orders for a 12-month horizon to ensure our place in the queue. At the same time, we have intensified spot buys and alternate parts qualifications in partnership with Research & Development. In parallel, we continue our advocacy towards the industry and governments on prioritizing supply for life-saving equipment.\n\nIn 2022, extremely high energy costs, especially in Europe, and increasing labor costs driven by inflation led to a significant rise in production/operational cost in our supply base. In the second half of the year, these same drivers led to a slowdown of demand, and spot prices for commodities and energy started to come off from their historical peaks in the second quarter. However, costs for production and materials remained at historical elevated levels. Specifically for electronic components, although the supply crunch has receded from its peaks, distributor data suggest that shortages will continue into 2023.\n\nFor information about the Philips Respironics recall and remediation effort, please refer to Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70.\n\n## Driving end-to-end supply chain reliability and agility\n\nWhereas Philips' supply chain organization historically delivered efficiencies through a functional orientation, the above-mentioned factors required much greater agility for our businesses, each having their own specific requirements. We are moving to a business and customer-centric orientation to address end-to-end visibility and improve reliability and outcomes by implementing solutions that are tailored to specific business needs.\n\nMuch like the rest of the industry, we remain exposed to inflation and the continued geopolitical tensions around the world. All of these challenges have reinforced our strategy for a more 'regional vs global' approach to our end-to-end network design.\n\nPhilips has continued to progress the consolidation of its manufacturing footprint into versatile 'multi-modality' manufacturing sites that produce multiple product categories and are located within or near the regions they serve. We do this for enhanced scale, efficiency and customer proximity, and to reduce our environmental footprint. While our site count has continued to decrease, the number of locations equipped to make the same product is increasing. Philips is using its multi-modality sites, in combination with contract manufacturing partners, to regionally 'multi-source' many of its products. This will increase the resilience of our supply chain to manage future, unplanned disruptions and ensure access to public healthcare investment where 'local' requirements exist in our largest markets.",

In 2022, we reduced our warehousing footprint by 31% compared to 2021, essentially through consolidation and servicing of multiple businesses from a single location.\n\nOn the logistics front, we have established long-term contracts with suppliers, with the aim of increasing reliability as well as secured costs and availability on contracted lanes. We continue to explore and implement solutions to diversify transportation options to increase reliability while reducing carbon emission and cost.\n\n## Supplier spend analysis per region in % Philips Group\n\n|                          | 2022   |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| Western Europe           | 30%    |\n| North America            | 36%    |\n| Other mature geographies | 6%     |\n| Total mature geographies | 71%    |\n| Growth geographies       | 29%    |\n| Philips Group            | 100%   |\n\n## Supplier sustainability 3.6.2\n\nPhilips' purpose to improve people's lives applies throughout our value chain. An important area of focus for the Integrated Supply Chain is sustainability, and we are actively working on this together with our partners, whether these be component suppliers or energy or logistics providers. Close cooperation with our suppliers not only helps us deliver health technology innovations, it also supports new approaches that help us minimize our environmental impact and maximize the social and economic value we create.\n\nSince 2003, our sustainability strategy has included dedicated supplier sustainability programs. We have a direct (tier 1) business relationship with approximately 5,300 product and component suppliers and 17,100 service providers. In many cases, social issues deeper in our supply chain require us to intervene beyond tier 1 of the chain.\n\nWe want to make a difference through sustainable supply management and responsible sourcing. This is more than just managing compliance - it is about collaborating with our supply partners to make a positive and lasting impact. Therefore, the sustainability performance of our suppliers is fully embedded in our procurement strategy and way of working.\n\nIn 2022, we focused on further maximizing our positive impact deeper in the supply chain, strengthening our maturity-based approach to drive continuous improvement. Through the Supplier Sustainability Performance program, we improved the lives of approximately\n\n459,000 workers in our supply chain (2021: 430,000). We also launched new ways to engage our suppliers, performing deep-dives at second-tier suppliers and actively supporting our strategic partners to become more effective in their own supply chain engagement approaches.\n\nIn addition, our improvement program has been adopted by the Responsible Business Alliance under the name Responsible Factory Initiative. This program enables other companies to work on continuously improving their suppliers' sustainability performance through the same methodology as Philips.\n\nManaging our large and diverse supply chain in a socially and environmentally responsible way requires a structured and innovative approach, while being transparent and engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders. In 2022, our programs focused specifically on improving suppliers' sustainability performance, responsible sourcing of minerals, and reducing the environmental footprint of our supply base by driving the adoption of Science Based Targets.\n\nDetailed information on our supplier sustainability programs is available in section Supplier indicators, starting on page 286 of this Annual Report.",

On a comparable basis *) , sales declined 3%, due to operational and supply challenges, the COVID situation in China, the consequences of the Respironics field action, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Comparable sales *) showed a 1% decline in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, an 11% decline in the Connected Care businesses, and flat growth in the Personal Health businesses.\n- \u00b7 Net income amounted to a loss of EUR 1,605 million, a decrease of EUR 4.9 billion compared to 2021, mainly due to a charge of EUR 1.5 billion related to goodwill and R&D impairments in 2022 and the EUR 2.5 billion gain on the sale of Domestic Appliances in 2021.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, our subsidiary, Philips Respironics, initiated a voluntary recall notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for certain sleep and respiratory care products. In 2022, as we took steps to accelerate the remediation program, we recorded an additional provision of EUR 250 million. By year-end 2022, around 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients had been completed.\n- \u00b7 Due to revisions to the financial forecast of Philips Respironics, Philips recorded a EUR 1.3 billion non-cash charge in the third quarter for the impairment of goodwill of this business.\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA *) amounted to EUR 1,318 million, or 7.4% of sales, compared to 12.0% of sales in 2021. The Diagnosis & Treatment, Connected Care and Personal Health businesses showed a decline in Adjusted EBITA *) margin, mainly due to the sales decline and cost inflation, partly offset by pricing and productivity measures.\n- \u00b7 Philips has initiated several productivity actions, including simplifying the organization to streamline ways of working, increase agility and reduce operating expenses. Additionally, Philips is implementing several actions to enhance performance and productivity in the supply chain, R&D and quality.\n- \u00b7 Operating cash flow amounted to an outflow of EUR 173 million; free cash flow *) amounted to an outflow of EUR 961 million.\n- \u00b7 To further strengthen its liquidity position and optimize its debt maturity profile, Philips secured a EUR 1 billion credit facility and conducted a liability management exercise, which reduced the debt repayment profile for the period 2023 to 2025 from EUR 3.2 to 2.0 billion and increased the average maturity on bonds by 1.3 years to 7.9 years.",

Global real GDP is estimated to have grown by 3.0% in 2022, compared with the 6.0% estimated in 2021 for 2022.\n\nThe company's business and results in 2022 were impacted by global and industry-wide challenges, including global supply chain constraints, COVID lockdown measures in China, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine war. Where relevant, the impact of these factors and the resulting uncertainties on the company's results, balance sheet and cash flows have been considered and are reflected in amounts reported. Comparable sales *) declined by 3%, mainly due to operational and supply chain challenges, the COVID situation in China and the Russia-Ukraine war. We aim to offset the operational and supply challenges\n\nwith specific programs to increase supply chain resilience, improve patient safety and quality, and simplify the organization to increase agility and structurally lower the cost base.\n\n## Global supply chain constraints\n\nLimited availability and delays in the supply of certain components and products internationally - partly a consequence of COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war - impacted the company's results in 2022. In addition, the supply chain constraints resulted in an increase in overall working capital balances, in particular inventories. Inventories increased compared to 2021, as work-in-process inventories could not be converted into finished goods available for sale due to the scarcity of certain components. Improved component supplies contributed to a comparable sales *) increase in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nIn response, we continue to drive significant actions to increase supply chain resilience and mitigate the impact of disruptions. We are: engaging with senior government officials, strategic suppliers and foundries to prioritize healthcare supplies; directly working on component issues across all tiers of suppliers; diversifying sourcing of high-risk components, with almost 400 alternate components certified to date. Lastly, we are also redesigning our printed circuit boards to qualify alternate sources of supply.\n\n## COVID situation in China\n\nCOVID continued to affect the company's results, balance sheet and cash flows presented in these consolidated financial statements, in particular due to the lockdowns in China. Production in several of our factories, as well as those of our suppliers in China, was suspended periodically, which exacerbated the global supply chain and cost challenges. The China lockdowns impacted the results of operations due to lower sales and factory underutilization.\n\nCOVID did not result in any material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities during 2022. In addition, there were no material changes to treasury and other financial risks directly related to the pandemic.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nGlobal inflation and cost headwinds, including higher energy prices, resulted in an increase in cost levels and negatively impacted gross margin in 2022.\n\nIn response, we have been raising pricing by low- to mid-single-digits since the beginning of 2022. In the Personal Health businesses, the higher sales prices contributed to a gross increase in sales of around 3% compared to 2021. In the Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care businesses, due to the longer equipment order book cycles, the price increases take longer to be fully realized in the profit and loss account.",

This includes stopping shipments of our consumer health products to the country (except for certain child care products), the suspension of marketing activities, and winding down of R&D activities. We are focusing our remaining activities in Russia on the delivery of medical systems, devices, and spare parts to healthcare providers to the extent possible under export controls and sanctions. Philips' operations in Russia and Ukraine on a combined basis represented less than 2% of group sales in both 2021 and 2022. The asset value of the activities in Russia and Ukraine, mainly working capital, was less than 1% of the consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. There have been no significant asset write-downs to date, but we continue to closely monitor developments in this regard. The Russia-Ukraine war continues to put severe pressure on the global commodity landscape and supply chains, and has contributed to the sharp rise in energy and food prices and high cost inflation, as further discussed above.\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has considered the impact of climate change, specifically the financial impact of Philips meeting its internal and external climate-related aims, the potential impact of climate-related risks, and the costs incurred to pro-actively manage such risks. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or assumptions. The financial impacts considered include specific climate mitigation measures, such as the use of lower carbon energy sources, the cost of developing more sustainable product offerings, and expenses incurred to mitigate against the impact of extreme weather conditions. To meet its long-term Science Based Targets and reduce its full value chain emissions in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario, Philips has entered into a number of power purchase agreements. Some of these contracts have a fixed price structure, which in 2022 helped to mitigate the impact of increased electricity prices.\n\n## Actions in response\n\nIn 2022, Philips took several actions to enhance performance and productivity in the supply chain (e.g. dual sourcing, supplier consolidation, warehouse footprint rationalization), R&D (e.g. shifting the focus to fewer, high-impact projects in the innovation pipeline) and quality (e.g. enhancing processes, increasing capabilities and product management). As a result, Philips recorded non-cash portfolio realignment impairments and charges of EUR 282 million in 2022, consisting of R&D project impairments of EUR 134 million, Connected Care portfolio realignment charges of EUR 109 million and asset impairments in Sleep & Respiratory Care of EUR 39 million.\n\nAs announced in October 2022, Philips has initiated general productivity actions, including simplifying the organization to streamline the way of working and reduce operating expenses. This includes an immediate reduction of around 4,000 positions globally across the organization, subject to consultation with the relevant workers councils and social partners, with severance and termination-related costs of EUR 80 million incurred in 2022 and an additional EUR 50 million expected in 2023.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, Philips announced plans to create value with sustainable impact, which is based on focused organic growth to deliver patient- and people-driven innovation at scale, with improved execution as a key value driver, prioritizing patient safety and quality, supply chain reliability and a simplified operating model. In addition to the reduction of its workforce by 4,000 roles announced in October 2022, Philips plans to reduce its workforce by an additional 6,000 roles globally by 2025, of which 3,000 will be implemented in 2023, in line with relevant local regulations and processes. These reductions are focused on Corporate and Functions optimization and non-core activities, for which charges in 2023 are expected to be approximately EUR 470 million.",

Considering a 6.7% positive effect from currency and consolidation, comparable sales *) decreased by 2.8%. This was driven by a positive currency effect, mainly due to appreciation of currencies against the euro, and affected all segments.\n\nThe order book at year-end 2022 was 10% higher than at the end of 2021, ensuring a higher coverage for sales in 2023. The increase mainly relates to the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses driven by Diagnostic Imaging. Comparable order intake decreased 3%, compared to 4% growth in 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, lower demand for COVID-19-related products compared to 2021 and company actions to improve the order book margin profile contributed to this decrease.\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nIn 2022, sales amounted to EUR 9,168 million, 6.2% higher than in 2021 on a nominal basis. Considering a 6.9% positive currency effect and consolidation impact, comparable sales *) decreased by 0.7%. This was due to mid-single-digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and low-single-digit growth in Enterprise Diagnostic Informatics, which was more than offset by a decline in Ultrasound and in Diagnostic Imaging due to specific electronic component shortages.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nIn 2022, sales amounted to EUR 4,403 million, 3.7% lower than in 2021 on a nominal basis. Considering a 7.1% positive currency effect and consolidation impact, comparable sales *) decreased by 10.8%. This was mainly due to the consequences of the Respironics field action and the impact of supply chain headwinds.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nIn 2022, sales amounted to EUR 3,626 million, 5.7% higher than in 2021 on a nominal basis. Considering a 5.6% positive currency effect and consolidation impact, comparable sales *) increased by 0.1%, consisting of a global increase of 2.5%, offset by a 2.4% decline in sales attributable to Russia due to the war with Ukraine. Oral Healthcare and Mother & Child Care recorded mid-single-digit growth, which was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Personal Care.\n\n## Other\n\nIn 2022, sales amounted to EUR 629 million, compared to EUR 519 million in 2021. The increase was mainly due to additional royalty income and supplies to the divested Domestic Appliances business.",

Other key factors influencing cost of sales were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of materials used increased by EUR 178 million in 2022, mainly due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and cost inflation, partly offset by the reduced field action provision and productivity measures.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortization increased by EUR 56 million in 2022, mainly due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact.\n- \u00b7 Other manufacturing costs increased by EUR 193 million in 2022, mainly driven by an unfavorable foreign currency impact and cost inflation, partly offset by the lower field action provision and productivity measures.\n\n## Gross margin\n\nIn 2022, Philips' gross margin was EUR 7,194 million, or 40.4% of sales, compared to EUR 7,168 million, or 41.8% of sales, in 2021. Gross margin was flat year-on-year due to cost inflation and a decrease in sales, which was offset by a favorable foreign currency impact, a decrease in restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges, and productivity and pricing measures.\n\n## Selling expenses\n\nSelling expenses amounted to EUR 4,609 million, or 25.9% of sales, in 2022, compared to EUR 4,258 million, or 24.8% of sales, in 2021. The year-on-year increase in selling expenses of EUR 351 million was mainly due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and an increase in restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 671 million, or 3.8% of sales, in 2022, compared to EUR 599 million, or 3.5% of sales, in 2021. The year-on-year increase of EUR 72 million was mainly driven by higher restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges.",

For further information, refer to Financial income and expenses, starting on page 167.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense decreased by EUR 10 million year-on-year, mainly due to lower income, partly offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business in 2022 and a one-off benefit relating to the recognition of tax assets due to a business transfer in 2021.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nResults related to investments in associates improved from a loss of EUR 4 million in 2021 to a loss of EUR 2 million in 2022.

The increase mainly comes from the issuance of EUR 2 billion Notes in April 2022, offset by the early redemption of approximately EUR 1.2 billion Notes originally due in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 and by the utilization of EUR 500 million under the credit facility entered into in October 2022.

The transactions included the issuance of three series of Notes under its EMTN program for a total of EUR 2 billion with maturities in 2027, 2029 and 2033. Part of the proceeds were used to tender certain of Philips' outstanding US Dollar denominated bonds due 2025 and 2026 and Euro-denominated bonds due 2023, 2024 and 2025, as well as make-whole and fully redeem the Euro-denominated bonds due 2023 and 2024 that were not purchased as part of the Euro tender offer. Philips issued Commercial Paper of EUR 200 million in September 2022 and EUR 101 million in October 2022. These tranches were repaid throughout the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, in October 2022 Philips entered into a EUR 1 billion credit facility that can be used for general corporate purposes. The credit facility matures in October 2023 and has a 12-month extension option at Philips discretion. Per yearend 2022, EUR 500 million was utilized and outstanding under the credit facility.\n\nIn 2021, total debt increased by EUR 46 million compared to 2020. The increase mainly comes from currency effects and consolidation changes, partly offset by net lease repayments and forward settlements. Repayments of long-term debt amounted to EUR 302 million.

As part of our capital allocation policy, our net debt *) position is managed with the intention of retaining our strong investment grade credit rating. Ratings are subject to change at any time and there is no assurance that Philips will be able to achieve this goal. Philips' aim when managing the net debt *) position is dividend stability and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders *) . Philips' outstanding long-term debt and credit facilities do not contain financial covenants. Adverse changes in the company's ratings will not trigger automatic withdrawal of committed credit facilities or any acceleration in the outstanding long-term debt (provided that the USDdenominated bonds issued by Philips in March 2008 and 2012 contain a 'Change of Control Triggering Event' and the EUR-denominated bonds contain a 'Change of Control Put Event'). A description of Philips' credit facilities can be found in Debt, starting on page 191.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Credit rating summary\n\n|                   | long-term   | short-term   | outlook   |\n|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Fitch             | A-          |              | Stable    |\n| Moody's           | Baa1        | P-2          | Negative  |\n| Standard & Poor's | BBB+        | A-2          | Negative  |\n\nPhilips pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible. Cash not pooled remains available for local operational needs or general purposes. The company faces cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a few countries, which could limit its ability to make these balances available on short notice for general use by the group.\n\nPhilips believes its current liquidity and direct access to capital markets is sufficient to meet its present financing needs.\n\n## Shareholders' equity 4.10\n\nIn 2022, shareholders' equity decreased by EUR 1,189 million to EUR 13,249 million at yearend. The decrease was mainly due to net loss of EUR 1,608 million, dividend distributed (EUR 412 million), and settlements of earlier concluded forward contracts (EUR 140 million). This was partly offset by currency translation gains of EUR 749 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, shareholders' equity increased by EUR 2,568 million to EUR 14,438 million at yearend. The increase was mainly due to net income of EUR 3,323 million and currency translation gains of EUR 1,117 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro in 2021. This was partly offset by the dividend distributed (EUR 482 million), settlements of earlier concluded forward contracts (EUR 869 million) and the share repurchases made in the open market (EUR 758 million).\n\n## Share capital structure\n\nThe number of issued common shares of Royal Philips as of December 31, 2022 was 889,315,082.

During 2022, Philips used methods (i) to repurchase shares for capital reduction purposes and methods (ii) and (iii) to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe open market transactions via an intermediary allow for buybacks during both open and closed periods.\n\nFor more information on share repurchase transactions entered into 2022, 2021, and 2020, please refer to Group Financial Statements Note 18 Equity, Forward share repurchase plans / contracts, starting on page 187\n\nImpact of share acquisitions and cancellations on share count in thousands of shares as of December 31 Philips Group\n\n|                    | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Shares issued      | 926,196 | 896,734 | 911,053 | 883,899 | 889,315 |\n| Shares in treasury | 12,011  | 5,760   | 5,925   | 13,717  | 7,835   |\n| Shares outstanding | 914,184 | 890,974 | 905,128 | 870,182 | 881,481 |\n| Shares acquired    | 31,994  | 40,390  | 8,670   | 45,486  | 5,081   |\n| Shares cancelled   | 24,247  | 38,541  | 3,810   | 33,500  | 8,758   |",

In 2022, Philips entered into a total amount of EUR 63 million of forward contracts relating to the repurchase of up to 3.2 million shares to cover long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans. In addition, in 2022 there were maturities of a total of EUR 83 million of forward contracts related to the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program announced in July 2021, as well as maturities of a total of EUR 57 million of forward contracts to repurchase shares to cover long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans. Philips intends to cancel all of the shares acquired under the share buyback program, as the program was initiated for capital reduction purposes.\n\nPhilips offers voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers with the opportunity to factor their trade receivables at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. Philips continues to recognize these liabilities as trade payables and settles them accordingly on the invoice maturity date based on the terms and conditions of these arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately EUR 151 million (2021: EUR 139 million) of the Philips accounts payable were transferred under these arrangements.\n\n## Other cash commitments\n\nThe company and its subsidiaries sponsor post-employment benefit plans in many countries in accordance with legal requirements, customs and the local situation in the countries involved. For a discussion of the plans and expected cash outflows, please refer to Postemployment benefits, starting on page 198.\n\nThe company had EUR 140 million restructuring-related provisions by the end of 2022, of which EUR 134 million is expected to result in cash outflows in 2022. Refer to Provisions, starting on page 193 for details of restructuring provisions.\n\nPhilips has contracts with investment funds where it committed itself to make, under certain conditions, capital contributions to these funds of an aggregated remaining amount of EUR 127 million (2021: EUR 116 million). Capital contributions already made to these investment funds are recorded as non-current financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to Dividend, starting on page 43 for information on the proposed dividend distribution.\n\nPlease refer to Equity, starting on page 187 for information on other Long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nPhilips' policy is to provide guarantees and other letters of support only in writing. Philips does not provide other forms of support. The total fair value of guarantees recognized on the balance sheet amounts to EUR nil million for both 2021 and 2022. Remaining offbalance-sheet business-related guarantees on behalf of third parties and associates amount to EUR 2 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 2 million).\n\n## Dividend 4.12\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nPhilips' dividend policy is aimed at dividend stability and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders *) .",

In compliance with the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Amsterdam, the dividend record date will be May 12, 2023.\n\nThe number of share dividend rights entitled to one new common share will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price of all traded common shares of Koninklijke Philips N.V. at Euronext Amsterdam on May 11, 12 and 15, 2023. The company will calculate the number of share dividend rights entitled to one new common share (the ratio), such that the gross dividend in shares will be approximately equal to EUR 0.85. The ratio and the number of shares to be issued will be announced on May 17, 2023. Distribution of the dividend (up to EUR 751 million) and delivery of new common shares, with settlement of any fractions in cash, will take place from May 18, 2023.\n\n|                         | ex-dividend date   | record date   | distribution from   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| Euronext Amsterdam      | May 11, 2023       | May 12, 2023  | May 18, 2023        |\n| New York Stock Exchange | May 11, 2023       | May 12, 2023  | May 18, 2023        |\n\nFurther details will be given in the agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The proposed distribution and all dates mentioned remain provisional until then.\n\nDividend in shares distributed out of retained earnings is subject to 15% dividend withholding tax, but only in respect of the par value of the shares (EUR 0.20 per share). Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisor on the applicable situation with respect to taxes on the dividend received.\n\nIn June 2022, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 741 million (including costs). Shareholders could elect for a cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 45% of the shareholders elected for a share dividend, resulting in the issuance of 14,174,568 new common shares, leading to a 1.6% dilution. For more information refer to Shareholders' equity, starting on page 40. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an amount of EUR 411 million (including costs).\n\n## Dividends and distributions per common share\n\nThe following table sets forth in euros the gross dividends on the common shares in the fiscal years indicated (from prior-year profit distribution) and such amounts as converted into US dollars and paid to holders of shares of the New York Registry:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Gross dividends on the common shares\n\n|        |   2018 1) |   2019 1) |   2020 2) |   2021 1) |   2022 2) |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| in EUR |      0.8  |      0.85 |      0.85 |      0.85 |      0.85 |\n| in USD |      0.94 |      0.96 |      0.95 |      1.03 |      0.9  |\n\n## Analysis of 2021 compared to 2020 4.13\n\nThe analysis of the 2021 financial results compared to 2020, and the discussion of the critical accounting policies, have not been included in this Annual Report. These sections are included in Philips' Form 20-F for the financial year 2022, which will be filed electronically with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n## Outlook 4.14\n\nWe remain cautious in light of the subdued economic outlook for the year, staffing and inflationary pressures facing our customers, geopolitical risks, supply and demand volatility, and uncertainties around ongoing consent decree negotiations, litigation and Department of Justice investigations. Nevertheless, we expect that, by prioritizing patient safety and quality, tightening our focus on innovation and strengthening our category leadership areas, while at the same time improving execution and taking a disciplined approach to capital, we will be able to progressively create value with sustainable impact.\n\nLooking ahead, Philips expects to deliver low-single-digit comparable sales growth *) and high-single-digit Adjusted EBITA *) margin in 2023. Considering the slowing of consumer demand and a gradual improvement of the order book conversion during 2023, Philips anticipates a slow start to the year, with improvements throughout the year supported by the ongoing productivity, pricing and other actions. This guidance excludes the impact of the ongoing discussion on a consent decree beyond current assumptions (Sleep & Respiratory Care/Respironics CSGR 2023-2025 of 10%), as well as ongoing litigation and the investigation by the US Department of Justice related to the Respironics field action.",

They give expression to an increasingly widely held view - that companies that hold themselves accountable to their stakeholders and increase transparency will be more viable, and valuable, in the long term.\n\nPhilips is a purpose-driven company aiming to improve the health and well-being of 2.5 billion people annually by 2030. We believe that private-sector companies like ours have a vital role to play in collaborating with other partners across our supply chain, and with private and public organizations in society, to address the major challenges the world is facing.\n\nTaking a multi-stakeholder approach, we draw inspiration from the societal impact we can have through our products and solutions, and through how we operate in the world. Our company is very conscious of our responsibility and our contribution to society and the environment. We are also witnessing growing interest in ESG on the part of our customers, who are increasingly turning to technology companies for support in addressing their sustainability objectives and are including ESG-related considerations in their procurement policies and criteria.\n\nWe aim to be a front-runner in the area of ESG and have been recognized as leading the way in, for example, sustainability, corporate governance practices and tax transparency.\n\nOur reporting is aligned with the comprehensive and integrated Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) commitments we have adopted for the period 2020-2025.\n\nWe have excluded the data from Domestic Appliances from the ESG information wherever possible. In a limited number of cases, for example for road logistics emissions, we have used proxies. If Domestic Appliances information was not available for past years, and could therefore not be excluded, we have indicated this in the respective section. The Employee Engagement Index (EEI) and General Business Principles (GBP) results have not been restated.\n\n## ESG reporting framework 5.1\n\nBuilding on our extensive experience of environmental and social impact measurement and of providing transparency on governance, Philips has taken an active role - in collaboration with, in particular, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the European Union - to help drive the evolution towards a standard ESG reporting framework.\n\nIn 2007, Philips signed up to the United Nations Global Compact, to advance ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. In 2017, at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, we signed the Compact for Responsive and Responsible Leadership - an initiative (initiated by WEF and Philips) to promote and align the long-term sustainability of corporations and the long-term goals of society, with an inclusive approach for all stakeholders. The WEF secured a commitment from over 140 CEOs to align their corporate values and strategies with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2020, the WEF's International Business Council (IBC) published its core set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and disclosures. These can be used by companies to align their mainstream reporting on performance against environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators and track their contributions towards the SDGs on a consistent basis. Thus far, 135 companies reported in line with this framework. Based where possible on existing standards, the full set is comprised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Core metrics: A set of 21 more-established or critically important metrics and disclosures that focus primarily on activities within an organization's own boundaries.\n- \u00b7 Expanded metrics: A set of 34 metrics and disclosures that tend to be less well-established in existing practice and have a wider value chain scope or convey impact in a more sophisticated or tangible way, e.g. in monetary terms.\n\nThe recommended metrics are organized under four pillars that are aligned with the SDGs and principal ESG domains: Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity. There is no intention to replace industry- or company-specific metrics (like our Lives Improved metric). Companies are encouraged to report against as many of the core and expanded metrics as they find material and appropriate, on the basis of 'disclose or explain'.",

The Taxonomy Regulation is relatively new and there are after the first year of reporting (2021) still significant uncertainties around its phased implementation. It is expected, however, that the EU Taxonomy will develop into a comprehensive and detailed framework over the coming years.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation provides certain conditions for taxonomy alignment. Among others, the relevant activity must substantially contribute to one or more of the following six environmental objectives (while not significantly harming any of the others):\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThe delegated acts adopted under the Taxonomy Regulation will provide technical screening criteria which must also be met to constitute taxonomy alignment. On the date of this Annual Report 2022, only one relevant delegated act has been adopted, concerning activities significantly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nThe taxonomy framework provisions effective on the date of this Annual Report 2022 require Philips to disclose the proportion of its taxonomy-eligible activities (described in any delegated act adopted to date) and non-eligible economic activities in its total turnover, capital and operational expenditure, as well as certain qualitative information. We used the delegated act ((EU) 2021/2139) to identify activities that are eligible. However, none of our revenue-generating activities were included as this delegated act only applies to sectors with very high CO 2 emissions. As a result, Philips' core activities are not within the scope of\n\nthis delegated act and consequently none of Philips' revenues were eligible under this delegated act during 2022 (0%). All revenues were non-eligible (100%). We used delegated act (EU) 2021/2178 for the definition and calculation of the taxonomy-eligible percentages. Revenue is calculated based on 'Sales' as per Consolidated statements of income, starting on page 145. Philips expects to be eligible and report its taxonomy-eligible revenues under additional environmental objectives as further delegated acts with applicable technical screening criteria are adopted.\n\n## Philips Group\n\nProportion of turnover from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities 2022 in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n| Economic activities                                        | Absolute Turnover   | Proportion of turnover   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| A.

We therefore screened (EU) 2021/2139, assessed our capital expenditure and identified relevant activities mainly related to our real estate portfolio. For these activities, capital expenditures are determined based on the 2022 additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and additions to right-of-use assets, excluding any re-assessments (refer to Property, plant and equipment, starting on page 173 and Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 181).\n\nReportable taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures in 2022 amounted to EUR 8 million, or 1% of total capital expenditure (non-eligible capital expenditures 99%), and mainly related to energy efficiency improvement measures in our buildings (installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment), such as energy efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in various locations around the world. Next, we invested in onsite renewable electricity generation (installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies) by installing PV panels in one of our factories in Asia.\n\nWe assessed compliance with the criteria set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the associated technical screening criteria on a project basis.",

Besides our social impact, focusing on SDG 3, described in the Social performance section, we have an environmental impact through our global operations (including our supply chain), but even more so through our products and solutions. This is where we contribute to SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and SDG 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nIn this Environmental performance section, an overview is given of the most important environmental parameters of our ESG commitments. Details can be found in the ESG statements, starting on page 266.\n\n## Environmental impact\n\nPhilips has been performing Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) since 1990. LCAs provide insight into the lifetime environmental impact of our products. They are used to steer our EcoDesign efforts by reducing the environmental impact during the lifetime of our products and to grow our Green/EcoDesigned/EcoHero and Circular Solutions portfolio. As a next step, for the sixth year, we have measured our environmental impact on society at large via a so-called Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account, which includes the hidden environmental costs associated with our activities and products. It provides insights into the main environmental hotspots and innovation areas to reduce the environmental impact of our products and solutions.\n\nThe EP&L account is based on LCA methodology, in which the environmental impacts are expressed in monetary terms using conversion factors developed by CE Delft. These conversion factors are subject to further refinement and are expected to change over time. We used expert opinions and estimates for some parts of the calculations. The figures reported are Philips' best possible estimates. As we gain new insights and retrieve more and better data, we will enhance the methodology, use-cases and accuracy of results in the future. For more information and details we refer to our methodology document.\n\nThe definition of the use-case scenarios has a significant impact on the result, especially for consumer products, which have large sales volumes, long lifetimes and frequently high energy consumption.\n\nThe current EP&L account only includes the hidden environmental costs. It does not yet include the benefits to society that Philips generates by improving people's health and wellbeing through our products and solutions. We have a well-established methodology to calculate the number of lives we positively touch with our products and solutions. We aim to look into valuing these societal benefits in monetary terms in the future.\n\nThe Philips products subject to the Respironics recall were evaluated as part of the 2022 EP&L calculation. In accordance with the EP&L methodology, products replaced during the recall by new products with lifetime guarantees were included in the 2022 EP&L calculation for all life cycle stages. Refurbished products and repair kits were not included.",

This reduction was mainly driven by updated energy use cases for hair dryers (causing a reduction of around EUR 450 million) and a changed product mix (causing a EUR 250 million reduction), but was mitigated by the update to the EcoInvent 3.8 database (our Life Cycle Inventory database containing environmental impacts of products and services, causing around EUR 75 million increase) and further granulation of the data, including the application of country emission factors (causing around EUR 100 million increase). The most significant environmental impact, 63% of the total, is related to the usage of our products, which is due to electricity consumption. Human toxicity, particulate matter formation, and climate change are other important impacts. The environmental costs include the environmental impact of the full lifetime of the products that we put on the market in 2022, e.g. 10 years in the case of a MRI or 5 years of usage in the case of a Sonicare toothbrush. Products identified as rentals are the only exception, with an energy consumption of one year. As we expand our EcoDesign activities, with a target to have all our products EcoDesigned by 2025, we expect an environmental impact in the years to come.\n\nOf the total 2022 impact, just EUR 128 million (7%) is directly caused by Philips' own operations, mainly driven by outbound logistics, followed by business travel. Compared to EUR 106 million in 2021, this is a 21% increase, mainly due to more granular data on our operations and updating the emission factors from EcoInvent 3.4 to EcoInvent 3.8, mitigating the downward trend in logistics emissions as presented in Sustainable Operations, starting on page 56.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur materials and components supply chain currently has an environmental impact of some EUR 421 million, which is 26% of our total environmental impact. The main contributors are the electronic components (including printed circuit boards), cables and metals used in our products. Through our Circular Economy and Supplier Sustainability programs we will continue to focus on reducing the environmental impact caused by the materials we source and apply in our products. We will also include the impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the future.\n\nIn order to deliver on our carbon neutrality commitment, we have set ambitious reduction targets. In 2018, we were the first health technology company to have its 2020-2040 targets (including the use-phase of our products) approved by the Science Based Targets initiative a collaboration between CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) aimed at driving ambitious corporate climate action. Approval confirms that Philips' long-term targets are in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase below 2 \u00b0C. As a next step in our journey to reduce our environmental impact, and part of our ESG commitments launched in September 2020, we have committed to reduce our full value chain emissions in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario.",

We see a growing demand from our customers, including hospitals, to reduce their environmental impact and decarbonize healthcare. Our Green/EcoDesigned Innovation - the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of Green/EcoDesigned products and solutions and Green technologies, addressing SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) - is focused on addressing that impact.\n\nSustainable Innovation is the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of products and solutions that address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) or 12.\n\nIn 2022, Philips invested EUR 168 million in Green/EcoDesigned Innovation, a reduction compared to 2021 due to the completion of a number of sizeable innovation projects in the course of 2022. We expect this spend to increase again in the years to come. In 2022, over EUR 1.8 billion was invested in Sustainable Innovation.\n\nAs the current EU Taxonomy delegated act only applies to sectors with highest CO 2 emissions, Philips' activities are not within the scope of this delegated act and consequently none of Philips' R&D investments were eligible under this taxonomy during 2022.\n\nGreen Innovation per segment in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nPhilips develops innovative diagnosis and treatment solutions that support precision diagnosis and effective, minimally invasive interventions and therapy, while respecting the limits of natural resources. Investments in Green Innovation in 2022 amounted to EUR 93 million, comparable to EUR 96 million in 2021.\n\nAll Philips EcoDesign/Green Focal Areas are taken into account as we aim to reduce environmental impact over the total lifecycle. Energy efficiency is an area of focus, especially for our large imaging systems such as MRI. Through circular-ready design, Philips also pays particular attention to enabling the upgrading and reuse pathways, so our customers can benefit from enhancements in workflow, dose management and imaging quality and availability of re-used service parts with the equipment they already own. In addition, we are reducing the amount of hazardous substance and improving our packaging. We continued to actively partner with multiple leading care providers to investigate innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of healthcare, for example by maximizing energy-efficient use of medical equipment (by for example introducing EcoModes) and optimizing lifecycle",

Philips aims to close the loop on all medical equipment that becomes available to us by the end of 2025. To achieve this target, we actively drive trade-ins in markets where deinstall, trade-in and reverse logistics capabilities are in place, and build these capabilities in countries that do not yet have them.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nPhilips' connected health IT solutions integrate, collect, combine and deliver quality data for actionable insights to help improve access to quality care, while respecting the limits of natural resources. It is our belief that well-designed e-health solutions can reduce the travelrelated carbon footprint of healthcare, increase efficiency in hospitals, and improve access to care and outcomes. This has also become apparent during the COVID-19 crisis. Green/ EcoDesigned Innovation investments in 2022 amounted to EUR 31 million, in line with EUR 32 million in 2021. Green Innovation projects in 2022 will deliver the coming years, among other things, new EcoDesigned patient monitors with lower environmental footprints, reflecting all the Philips EcoDesign/Green Focal Areas. Energy efficiency, material reduction, less hazardous substances and closing the loop activities are the main areas of focus.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nR&D investments at our Personal Health businesses amounted to EUR 40 million in 2022, compared with EUR 65 million in 2021, as some larger innovation projects were finalized in the course of 2022. The Personal Health businesses continued their work on improving the energy efficiency of their products, closing the materials loop (e.g. by using recycled materials in products and packaging), and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact and childcare products. More specifically, as part of our Fit for Future Packaging program, we launched the first plastic free, mailbox-ready, packaging solution in our Grooming and Beauty portfolio for an online One Blade shaver, and plastic free packaging in the Female Depilation and Hairstyling portfolio. Philips also launched a foldable, more energy-efficient hairdryer containing recycled plastic.\n\n## Other\n\nThe segment Other invested EUR 4 million in Green/EcoDesigned Innovation, spread over projects focused on global challenges relating to water, air, energy, food, circular economy, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\n## Circular economy\n\nFor a sustainable world, the transition from a linear to a circular economy is essential. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these resources more effectively. It is a driver of innovation in the areas of material, component and product re-use, as well as new business models such as system solutions and services. At Philips, we have set ambitious targets to guide this journey. In 2020, as we announced our ESG commitments, we aimed, among other things, to generate 25% of our revenues from circular products and services, to extend our 'closing the loop' practices across all our medical products, and to further embed circular practices at our sites and send zero waste to landfill in our own operations.\n\nFor more information on our Circular Economy activities and the progress towards targets in 2022, please refer to Circular Economy, starting on page 274.",

Green/EcoDesigned Revenues amounted to EUR 12.8 billion in 2022, or 71.7% of sales (70.5% in 2021). This increase is mainly attributable to higher Green/ EcoDesigned revenues in the Precision Diagnosis and Personal Health businesses.\n\nAs the current EU Taxonomy delegated act only applies to sectors with highest CO 2 emissions, Philips' activities are not within the scope of this delegated act and consequently none of Philips' revenues were eligible under this taxonomy during 2022.\n\nGreen Revenues per segment in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated Philips Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our EcoDesign process we aim to create products and solutions that have significantly less impact on the environment over their whole lifecycle. Overall, the most significant improvements have been in energy efficiency and lower weight (thus less\n\nresources), although increased attention was also given to hazardous substances, packaging and recyclability in all segments in 2021, the latter driven by our Circular Economy initiatives.\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nIn 2022, a number of main platforms were launched in our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. CT7500 and various redesigns of current platforms have been launched offering further environmental improvements. Specific attention was paid to preparing for future EcoDesigned product launches.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nAfter several launches of new Green/EcoDesigned products in 2020, no major new launches took place in 2021 and 2022 except for the VS20 monitor which has good performance on all EcoDesign focal areas. New EcoDesigned Products are expected in 2023 with improvements on all EcoDesign focal areas.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nIn our Personal Health businesses, the focus is on Green/EcoDesigned Products and Solutions that meet or exceed our minimum requirements in the areas of energy consumption, packaging, substances of concern, and application of recycled plastics. Green/ EcoDesigned Revenues in 2022 amounted to 90% of total sales, compared to 85% in 2021. We continue to make progress in developing PVC/BFR-free products. More than 90% of our consumer product sales consist of PVC/BFR-free products, with the exception of power cords, for which there are not yet economically viable alternatives available. In our Oral Healthcare portfolio we introduced the first brush heads containing 75% bio-based materials.\n\n## Sustainable Operations 5.3.3\n\nPhilips' Sustainable Operations programs focus on the main contributors to climate change, recycling of waste, reduction of water consumption, and reduction of emissions.\n\nFull details can be found in ESG statements, starting on page 266.\n\n## Carbon footprint and energy efficiency\n\nAt Philips, we see climate change as a serious threat. Therefore, we are taking action to rethink our business models and decouple economic growth from the impact we have on the environment. We believe large corporates should lead the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will not only benefit the environment, but will also positively impact social and economic aspects.\n\nDuring the COP 21 United Nations Climate Conference in Paris in 2015, we committed to become carbon-neutral in our operations, pursue all efforts to reduce our operational emissions, source all our electricity from 100% renewable sources, and offset all unavoidable",

Since 2020, Philips has been carbon-neutral in its operations. We delivered on this commitment as a result of a comprehensive program that included energy-efficiency improvements, on-site renewables, Power Purchase Agreements, as well as business travel reduction and transport mode shifts to low-carbon emitting alternatives, and finally a carbon offset program.\n\nOur efforts are acknowledged by the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), a global NGO that assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance and management of reporting companies. In 2022, we were ranked on the CDP Climate Change 'A' List for our continued climate performance and transparency for the 10th consecutive year.\n\nHaving achieved our 2020 carbon neutrality target, we have raised the bar and set ambitious emission reduction targets to ensure we help limit the impact of global warming, not only in our operations, but throughout our value chain - collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact. That is why Philips has set new long-term emission reduction targets, which have been assessed and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) - locking down our commitment to drive climate action across the value chain, from suppliers to customers, and ensuring that we contribute to the decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 \u00b0C. At COP 26, we announced our plan to step up our acclaimed supplier sustainability program with the goal of having at least 50% of our suppliers (based on spend) committing to science-based targets (SBTs) for CO\u2082-e emissions reduction by 2025.\n\nWe stepped up our commitment to reduce our scope 3 carbon emissions in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario (Paris agreement). This commitment has been reviewed and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022, after we sold the Domestic Appliances business in 2021. The latter had a material downward impact on our scope 3 emissions, requiring a new assessment by the SBTi.\n\nIn 2022, our net operational carbon footprint resulted in zero kilotonnes carbon dioxideequivalent (CO 2 -e), mainly driven by continued use of 100% electricity from renewable sources and a continuing reduction in air freight. A total of 438 kilotonnes carbon dioxideequivalent (CO 2 -e) were compensated via carbon offsets.\n\nPhilips reports all its emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) as further described in Scope, starting on page 271.\n\n## Net operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent Philips Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope 1\n\nIn our sites, we reduced our scope 1 (direct) CO 2 -e emissions by 16% compared to 2021. Scope 1 emissions cover the emissions from our direct fuel consumption and the use of refrigerants that have a global warming potential. The reduction in scope 1 emissions is mainly driven by our continued energy efficiency measures, our program to phase out fossil fuels, working from home, and mild winters. As the consumption of natural gas is still the main source of our scope 1 emissions, we will continue to drive down our overall consumption and find alternative renewable sources to heat our buildings.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nIn 2022, our indirect scope 2 (market-based method) CO 2 -e emissions declined by 33% compared to 2021. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions cover the emissions of non-renewable electricity and purchased (city/district) heating and cooling. As we have already been sourcing 100% renewable electricity since 2020, the remaining emissions are associated with purchasing (city/district) heating and cooling, which we leverage as a low-carbon alternative",

Moving forward, we will continue to increase the renewable energy share of our (city/district) heating and cooling that we purchase.\n\nTo secure long-term delivery and quality of our renewable electricity, we have multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in place. For instance, the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. We closed the latter agreements with our renewable electricity purchasing consortium with Nouryon, DSM and Google, powering all our operations in the Netherlands. Combined with the Los Mirasoles wind farm, this covers 49% of our total electricity demand. In December 2020, Philips announced its next Power Purchase Agreement that will become operational during the summer of 2023, again in a purchasing consortium with Heineken, Nouryon and Signify, to power most of the remaining European sites with renewable electricity for the long term.\n\nIn 2022, our indirect scope 2 (location-based method) CO 2 -e emissions declined by 6% compared to 2021. Scope 2 (location-based method) emissions cover the emissions of electricity (excluding the renewable share) and purchased (city/district) heating and cooling. Emissions are calculated using average grid emission factors, ignoring the renewable electricity share of the reporting entity. This method indicates the efforts to reduce energy.\n\nOur operational energy efficiency improved by 9%, from 0.031 GWh/millions EUR sales in 2021 to 0.028 GWh/millions EUR sales in 2022.\n\nOur continued efforts to reduce our energy consumption, eliminate refrigerants with a high global warming potential (GWP), and increase our renewable energy share led to a 16% reduction in (scope 1 and scope 2 market-based) emissions in 2022 compared to 2021. Overall, we are making good progress, increasing our renewable energy share to 77% in 2022, from 74% in 2021. We are already overachieving our 2025 ambition to source 75% of our energy from renewable sources and delivering on our 2025 scope 1 and scope 2 (marketbased method) ambition. Even though we have already achieved our 2025 SBTi targets, we will continue to accelerate our efforts to phase out fossil fuels (mainly natural gas) consumption from our operations by driving down overall consumption and finding alternative renewable sources, making sure we remain well on track to deliver on our longterm (2040) science-based targets.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nIn our operational carbon footprint, we include two scope 3 (indirect) emission categories not included in scope 2 - that occur in the value chain, namely business travel and transportation & distribution. Together with our scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based method) emissions, these comprise our operational carbon footprint.\n\nOur business travel emissions, covering emissions from air travel, lease cars and rental cars, increased by 20% compared to 2021. This is mainly due to the fact that more of our employees are traveling to meet customers and are using their lease cars again postCOVID-19. The remaining effects of COVID-19 also continued to keep these emissions low compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. Moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and to promote online collaboration post-COVID-19 to limit air travel, as well as increasing our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a 22% decrease in emissions from our transportation & distribution compared to 2021. The scope of these emissions covers the CO 2 -e emitted by air freight, ocean freight, road freight and parcel shipments. As air freight accounts for most of our operational carbon footprint, we have taken several measures, such as the Corridor Project, where we shifted air freight shipments to ocean freight for several lanes. This helped to reduce our air freight emissions by 15% compared to 2021. CO 2 -e emissions from ocean freight decreased by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021. Most of these reductions can be attributed to the fact that the Domestic Appliances businesses have now been fully disentangled and (combined) shipment data for ocean freight now fully excludes all their related shipments. To quantify our ocean freight emissions by leveraging carrier-trade-lane specific emission factors, we use data from the Smart Freight Center - Clean Cargo (formerly known as the CCWG). This improved approach was implemented in 2021, allowing us to quantify our ocean freight emissions more accurately. This approach has been implemented for 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nEmissions from parcel shipments decreased by 10%, as the number of shipments increased but was mitigated by shorter average distances per shipment. The emissions from road transport decreased by 51%, mainly driven by a reduction of shipments and the average weight per shipment. The emission reductions in road freight are also impacted by the inclusion of combined shipments of Domestic Appliances and Philips in 2021. Historically, we were not able to exclude all the Domestic Appliances businesses' shipments from our shipment data.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to drive efforts to further reduce emissions from air freight and are exploring options to source sustainable fuel alternatives for shipments, which will help us to reach our long-term emission reduction targets.\n\nAlthough reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions required offsetting to gradually drive down our emissions to zero by year-end 2022. We did this by financing projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) and 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ). In 2022, we decreased offsets to 438 kilotonnes, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 13 million medium-sized oak trees. This covers the total emissions of our entire operations, including all CO 2 -e",

We do this\n\nby financing carbon reduction projects through long-term carbon offsets in emerging regions that drive social, economic and additional environmental progress for the local communities, such as:\n\n## Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption\n\nThis carbon-emission reduction project will provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and will reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard.\n\n## Replanting degraded land while providing education on health matters\n\nPlanting trees will improve livelihoods and address issues such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, and adaptation to climate change and provide support and education including on HIV and malaria. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard.\n\n## Protecting forests through sustainable production\n\nDeforestation is reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard.\n\n## Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy\n\nThe energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation in India. This enables an improvement in livelihoods. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard.\n\n## Improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves\n\nBy supporting a range of cookstove technologies across Ghana and Kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation for fuel. This also enables more time for paid work, thus improving prospects.

The approval confirms that Philips' targets across our value chain are in line to limit global warming to below 1.5 \u00b0C. By joining forces with our customers and suppliers, we can reduce our shared carbon footprint and help create a sustainable and more resilient healthcare industry.\n\nTogether with our customers and suppliers, we intend to continue to reduce our collective need for fossil fuels by using renewable and energy-efficient alternatives. To deliver, we will focus on the following four objectives:\n\n## 1. Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain\n\nWith growing global concerns about the impact of climate change, there is a pressing\n\nneed for industry and business to manage and reduce CO\n\n-e emissions across the entire\n\n2\n\nvalue chain - including at supplier level. To this end, we have invited many of our largest suppliers - first-tier manufacturing and transportation-related suppliers - to report their climate performance and strategy as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain program. Additionally, we engage with these suppliers to reduce their emissions as part of our Supplier Sustainability program. In October 2021, during COP26, we announced our ambition to have at least 50% of our suppliers (based on spend) committed to science-based targets for carbon reduction by 2025. At year-end 2022 already 41% of our suppliers (based on spend) had committed. Please refer to Supplier indicators, starting on page 286 for more details.\n\n## 2. Minimizing our climate impact in our supply chain by adopting circular economy principles\n\nFrom a climate perspective, applying circular business models leads to a significant emission reduction in our supply chain. As the value of materials is retained, the need for new abiotic resources is significantly reduced, and consequentially, the need for energy to produce those new resources/materials, leading to reduced emissions. This is also part of our Circular Economy program.\n\n## 3. Transitioning to lower carbon emitting energy in our sites\n\nBy continuing to phase out fossil fuels at our sites, we will be able to achieve our longterm emission targets. This entails, for example, moving towards geothermal and district heating and cooling solutions where available.\n\n- 4. Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase\n\nMore and more, our customers - both in healthcare and retail - are seeking solutions that are less impactful to the environment. To address that demand, we are continuously reducing the climate impact of our products by increasing energy efficiency, increasing the use of recycled plastics and other recyclable materials, and ensuring we make our packaging easier to re-use and recycle. We see improving energy efficiency as a huge lever to deliver on our value chain emission reductions. In 2022, we performed an initial assessment of our scope 3 category Use of Sold Products by estimating the lifetime energy consumption and applying the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology on a country-by-country basis. Initial results indicate that the emissions from the use of sold products are 3,898 kilotonnes CO 2 -e, approximately 9 times more than our entire operational carbon footprint. This emphasizes the need to drive energy efficiency efforts under our EcoDesign program and collaborate with our customers to magnify our impact.\n\n## Water\n\nPhilips is not a water-intense company. However, a number of our manufacturing sites are located in water-stressed regions in, for example, USA (California), India and Israel. With the help of the WRI Aqueduct tool, the water withdrawn from areas with high baseline water stress was identified across all Philips' industrial operations. It shows that around 13% of the industrial sites are located in Extremely High (>80%) baseline water stress areas. However,",

Water consumption in 2020 and 2021 was impacted by the government-mandated lockdowns and the working-from-home protocol resulting in a significant reduction in water intake at several sites (mainly in China).\n\nDiagnosis & Treatment, which consumes 46% of total water usage, recorded an 8% decrease, mainly caused by lower construction activity and effective processes, mitigated by a site expansion in India. Personal Health recorded a 4% increase. This was mainly due to the construction of a new factory in China, mitigated by decreased production volume at a water-intensive manufacturing site in Asia. Connected Care showed a decrease of 7%, due to the decreased production volume at a site in Asia, mitigated by construction activity at a site in North America.\n\n## 3\n\n## Water withdrawal in thousands of m Philips Group\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |    288 |    295 |    286 |    337 |    310 |\n| Connected Care        |    161 |    150 |    116 |    119 |    111 |\n| Personal Health       |    238 |    265 |    221 |    247 |    257 |\n| Philips Group         |    687 |    710 |    623 |    703 |    678 |\n\nIn 2022, 99.7% of water was purchased and 0.3% was extracted from groundwater wells.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2022, our manufacturing sites generated 22,802 tonnes of waste, an increase of 3% compared to 2021, mainly driven by the high impact of our construction activities in different locations across the globe and changes in the operations.\n\nThe Diagnosis & Treatment businesses increased waste by 7%, mainly driven by a strong increase in construction-related reused material in Best (see below), which was partially offset by the operational changes and lower construction activity on the other sites. The reported reused materials now constitute 22% of total waste. The Connected Care businesses increased waste by 5% due to the increased volume of reused materials and operational changes. The reported reused materials are 24% of the total waste. Personal Health decreased waste by 3% due to lower construction activity and changes in production.\n\n## Re-using temporary offices to house refugees\n\nIn the past, Philips in Best (Netherlands) decided to purchase temporary offices to resolve office space shortages, and after many years these temporary offices became redundant. Since the temporary offices were still of good quality, Philips made every effort to find a sustainable solution for the building and found a partner in COA (Centraal Orgaan opvang asielzoekers, the Dutch national organization helping asylum seekers). These units were completely refurbished for their new purpose: a COA location for people seeking asylum in the Netherlands. The 'new' building is located in Zeist. By re-using the offices, we are contributing to the provision of good housing for asylum seekers and to a circular society.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total waste in tonnes\n\n|                       | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 8,368  | 9,675  | 19,703 | 9,974  | 10,694 |\n| Connected Care        | 3,962  | 4,095  | 3,475  | 2,753  | 2,899  |\n| Personal Health       | 8,820  | 8,758  | 7,929  | 9,477  | 9,209  |\n| Philips Group         | 21,150 | 22,528 | 31,107 | 22,204 | 22,802 |\n\nUntil 2020, total waste consisted of waste that is delivered for landfill, incineration, waste to energy or recycling. We extended the scope with materials sent for reuse and other recovery as of 2021.\n\nMaterials delivered for reuse, other recovery or recycling via an external contractor amounted to 20,406 tonnes, which equals 89% of the total waste. Of the 11% remaining waste, 77% comprised non-hazardous waste and 23% hazardous waste. We recorded 1,484 tonnes of waste prevented in our own activities in 2022, compared to 1,525 tonnes in 2021.",

The Circular Material Management percentage was 91% in 2022, compared to 87% in 2021.\n\nOur Zero Waste to Landfill KPI excludes one-time-only waste and waste delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements. According to this definition, in 2022 we reported 1 tonne of waste sent to landfill, a significant reduction compared to 19 tonnes in 2021.

Climate change is exacerbating this situation and putting the lives of millions of people at risk. At Philips, we are conscious of our responsibilities towards society and the planet. It is our purpose to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation. As such, we aim to improve the lives of 2.5 billion people a year by 2030. To ensure we remain on track to achieve this goal, we have developed an integrated approach that tells us how many lives have been improved by our products and solutions in a given year. We call this our Lives Improved model.\n\nThe Lives Improved model helps us to track our performance on a country-to-country basis in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, allowing us to shape strategies to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages .\n\nIn 2022, Philips improved 1.81 billion lives, an increase of around 135 million compared to 2021. This increase was driven by a steady growth of all segments and the inclusion of our Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) products in the Lives Improved model. PACS is an image-management software within our Enterprise Diagnostic Informatics business. From a market perspective, we saw significant growth mainly in Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific, Iberia, Middle East & Turkey, and Africa.\n\nPhilips believes that improving access to healthcare requires meaningful innovation. It also requires a deep understanding of the relationship between all stakeholders and their specific needs in underserved communities to truly make a difference and help improve access to healthcare. We have an additional commitment to improve the lives of 300 million people in underserved communities with our health-related products by 2025, rising to 400 million by 2030.

Our behaviors create a shared understanding of how we all need to act in order to live up to our purpose of improving the lives of people around the world. All Philips employees are expected to commit to living our behaviors - customers first, patient safety, quality and integrity always, team up to win, take ownership to deliver fast, and be eager to improve and inspire - every step of the way. As we evolve our culture, we will drive patient- and people-centricity, accountability and empowerment, transparency and execution rigor in order to become an industry-leading player in HealthTech.\n\nAs we continue strengthening our position as a focused leader in health technology, leading with open, respectful and caring communication is critical. We foster a culture within Philips that will help us achieve operational excellence and extend our solutions capability to address our customers' unmet needs. Patient safety and quality are at the heart of our purpose. To further strengthen our patient- and people-centric culture, we launched in 2022 a company-wide 'Accelerating Patient Safety & Quality' culture program. We also foster an inclusive and psychologically safe environment where our people feel valued for who they are and for their contributions. We do this through our rich Well-being offering, as well as a 'Speak Up!' campaign in 2022. As a health technology leader, the health and well-being of our people is imperative for success.\n\nIn the wake of the evolving external economic, geopolitical, and global health situation, we remain flexible in our ways of working, making use of learnings developed through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have embraced a hybrid working model that offers greater flexibility and improved collaboration across teams. Our new ways of working are defined by three goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Embracing flexibility: Making innovative choices for how and where to work, allowing more autonomy for our employees.\n- \u00b7 Being at our best: Caring for ourselves, each other and our customers, patients and consumers. This means prioritizing our own well-being, as well as making time for personal growth and development.\n- \u00b7 Impactful collaboration: Creating moments to come together, supporting employees' sense of connection and belonging, so we can build strong teams, generate ideas and solve problems.\n\nAll of the above underpins how we lead, engage, hire and develop our employees. We have been focusing on well-being, deepening our leadership asks into the organization and supporting our culture shift as a leading innovative, customer-focused health technology company.\n\nWe are building an organization that is fit for today and the future with the skills and capabilities needed to successfully deliver on our strategic imperatives. We attract, onboard and retain the best talent to accelerate our business transformation.\n\n## Workforce of the Future 5.4.3\n\nIn 2022, transforming our organization and workforce for the future remained a key pillar of our People strategy. We are operating in a fast-changing landscape and adapting to changes in the nature of work accelerated by the pandemic. Moreover, at the end of 2022, a company-wide change initiative was launched. This requires us to continuously evolve capabilities in support of our business transformation. Our focus on the Workforce of the Future helps us attract, onboard, develop and retain a workforce that is fit for today and future with the skills and capabilities to successfully deliver on our strategic imperatives.\n\nWe staff our positions based on assessed behavior, potential and capabilities. In 2022, we filled 71% of our Director-level and more senior positions from within the company. We ensure our candidates are high performers with strong potential - more than 69% of all internal vacancies were filled by appointing top performers. We supplement this internal growth with targeted external hiring, bringing in employees with the behaviors and capabilities we require for our Workforce of the Future.\n\n## Strategic Capability Building\n\nWe apply an enterprise-wide Strategic Workforce Planning approach, which all businesses, markets and functions adopt as part of the strategic planning cycle, to identify and develop the capabilities needed to realize our ambitions as a health technology company. This approach recognizes that capabilities are complex, with people, processes and systems being developed holistically. In 2022, we strengthened our focus on strategic priorities and top talent and used the lens of strategic enterprise capabilities to streamline our talent attraction, onboarding, and development initiatives.\n\n## Total Workforce Strategy\n\nWe continue our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, locations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology is used to implement this strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the 'right shore' (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the 'right source' (employees, contingent workers and outsourced). The program has delivered \u20ac 20 million in savings in 2022.\n\nWe continue working with the Freelance Management System, which covers India, Netherlands, Germany and the USA. By advertising opportunities for freelancers on our own career site alongside employee jobs, in 2022 we filled 48% of all our freelancer roles without having to go through staffing agencies.",

The GDP lasts two years and includes three job rotations, as well as offering the graduates a comprehensive learning and development track and access to career centers to help guide future steps. We continue focusing on campus hiring, with 901 campus hires in 2022. Philips also offered meaningful work experience to 1,822 interns in 2022, and they formed a critical source of our graduate hires - with 55% of all graduate hires having been an intern with us prior.\n\nMore information on training and learning programs can be found in People development, starting on page 282.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity 5.4.4\n\nAs a health technology leader, we attach great importance to the health and well-being of our workforce and to creating an environment of inclusion and belonging, where all employees feel psychologically safe. Our company's success depends on our employees feeling valued, respected, and empowered to contribute fully. We are a diverse team made up of some 77,000 individuals across over 100 countries, all with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. We fully value and leverage these differences to ensure that creativity and innovation can flourish. Philips' commitment towards Inclusion & Diversity is reflected in our General Business Principles and the company-wide Inclusion & Diversity Policy and Fair Employment Policy.\n\n## Representation\n\nWe continue to put in place measures to enhance representation of diverse talent at all levels within the organization, and to ensure that representation at senior management levels reflects the diversity of our stakeholders, including consumers, our customers and their patients.\n\nTo this end, in 2022, Philips restated its commitment to having 35% of senior management positions held by women, by the end of 2025. Senior management positions (including senior directors and executives) amount to approximately 1,300 employees. As of year-end 2022, we had reached our initial goal (set in 2020) of a 30% representation of women in senior management.\n\nOur Supervisory Board has adopted the Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee, which also includes the Supervisory Board's aim that at least one-third of the members of each of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee are women and at least one-third are men. For more information on the Diversity Policy, please refer to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 115. At year-end, none of the three members of the Board of Management were women, and two out of the other nine members of the\n\nExecutive Committee were women. These numbers reflect a slight decline compared to previous years (2021: 3 out of 13; 2020: 3 out of 15), pending expected announcements of new leaders. The company generally seeks to fill vacancies by considering candidates that bring a diversity of (amongst others) gender, and it is noted that the selection of candidates is based on merit and there have been and may be pragmatic reasons - such as other relevant selection criteria and the availability of suitable candidates - that have impacted the achievement of our gender diversity goals.\n\nLong-term Inclusion & Diversity ambitions are embedded in our People strategy. In our ongoing effort to increase transparency and accountability, we are sharing data on the representation of women throughout our businesses, markets and functions, including a monthly review with the Executive Committee. We closely monitor the inflow, advancement and outflow of talent, which makes it possible to customize goals and intervene where appropriate. We continue various initiatives around unconscious bias, health and well-being, inclusion and development of underrepresented talent.\n\n## Gender diversity in % Philips Group\n\n## 1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1)\n\nIncludes Domestic Appliances\n\n## Global Diversity Council\n\nOur Global Diversity Council is comprised of 10 senior leaders representing our businesses, markets and functions. The Council provides governance and oversight on diversity efforts, promotes company-wide behavior change, and communicates on progress. Additionally, every Council member is an Executive Sponsor to one of our Employee Resource Groups.",

We continued to address mental health by rolling out the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), extending the service to a further 25 countries, including crisis support for Ukraine and Poland.\n\nWe grew our Mental Health Champion program to 180 Champions across the globe, providing accredited training for peer-to-peer confidential support. We also encouraged leader-led dialogues on mental health, to remove stigma and help engender a sense of psychological safety.\n\nOur efforts culminated in World Mental Health Day, with a variety of virtual mental wellbeing sessions and self-care tips that engaged employees from across our markets. In collaboration with Philips University, the Philips Energy Management well-being program was further extended across the organization.\n\n## Building Capability\n\nIn 2022, we continued the deployment of Unconscious Bias training across the organization while focusing new content on Allyship, Resilience and Psychological Safety. In North America, we launched four mandatory e-learnings, reaching our 20,000 employees in this market.\n\n## External awards\n\nMany stakeholders, including customers and potential partners and employees, view thirdparty assessments as objective indications of how well we are demonstrating the strength of our commitment. Awards received in 2022 included: Forbes Best Employers for Women; Forbes Best Place to Work in America; Forbes World Best Employers; and 100% Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.\n\n## Employee engagement 5.4.5\n\nWe continue to keep a close pulse on our employee sentiment through our quarterly Employee Engagement Survey. In 2022, average employee engagement scores remained high at 77% in line with the Fortune 500 benchmark. However there was a decline in overall engagement levels in the second half of 2022. This feedback does not come as a surprise given the recent challenges that the company has encountered and the announcement of productivity measures.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Employee Engagement index\n\n|             | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Favorable   | 79%    | 79%    | 77%    |\n| Neutral     | 14%    | 14%    | 15%    |\n| Unfavorable | 7%     | 7%     | 8%     |\n\nIn a challenging business environment, we listened actively to our employees to provide them with greater clarity on future direction and proactively deal with change to meet our customer and patient needs. Using the Customer Experience Index we look at how well employees think we orient ourselves to customer needs. These inputs are actively exchanged with the customer experience team to design and work on related programs.\n\nOur employee engagement is primarily driven by how proud our employees feel to work for Philips, as well as feeling that they can be themselves and have trusting relationships at work. Another significant factor driving engagement is our high scores on the Inclusion & Diversity index, which stays above the Industry Benchmark.",

This was followed in January 2023 by the announcement of a further reduction of our workforce by an additional 6,000 roles globally.

In the Netherlands, Philips was certified for Gender Equality by Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) in 2021. The study did not find a gender pay gap that exceeds the threshold as set by EDGE. Philips continues to study gender pay parity using EDGE methodology. Many countries in which Philips operates have already undertaken pay equity reviews, for example in Australia, UK, Sweden, India and certain US states. In the US, Philips will be executing a company-wide Pay Equity Project during 2023, originally scheduled for 2022, building on work completed at US state level.\n\n## Living wage 5.4.8\n\nPhilips can only achieve its aim to improve the lives of 2.5 billion people per year by 2030 if we support and empower our people, so they can be their best and perform effectively. To this end, we conducted a living wage analysis for the fourth year in a row on the lowest salaries in every country in which we currently operate.\n\nThe living wage is a concept defined by Anker and Anker (2017) as 'Remuneration received by a worker in a particular place sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his family. Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transport, clothing, and other essential needs, including provision for unexpected events'. We combined forces with Valuing Nature, several local NGOs, WageIndicator and other global corporates to develop living wage standards that are complete and have a reliable geographical scope.\n\nBased on the living wage analysis conducted in 2022, all Philips employees received wages and benefits that are consistent with at least the minimum Living Wage standard for an individual. Furthermore, 99% of Philips employees received wages and benefits that are consistent with at least the minimum Living Wage standard for a family (based on reference data from WageIndicator). Assuming no significant changes in reference data, it is expected that the wages of the 1% of employees currently below the family standard will be within that standard in the course of 2023.\n\n## Health and Safety 5.4.9\n\nIn 2022, the safety of our employees remained paramount. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic entered the endemic phase, the centralized controls put in place during the pandemic were relaxed in line with local governments' advice. Control was gradually returned from the Group Crisis Operations Team to the local Crisis Management Teams. As Philips started to resume normal operations, office occupancy started to rise and business travel restarted. However, critical control measures were maintained, including maintaining safety stocks of PPE, and the internal website containing guidance was updated regularly. Campaigns and advice concerning the importance of vaccinations was promoted widely. Philips has emerged from the pandemic with a good record of management and control that restricted the impact of the pandemic on employees and the wider business operations.\n\nAt Philips, we strive for an injury-free and illness-free work environment. Since 2016, the Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate has been defined as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A TRC is a case where an injured employee is unable to work for one or more days, has medical treatment, or sustains an industrial illness. We set yearly TRC targets for the company, businesses and industrial sites.\n\nWe recorded 172 TRCs in 2022, a 19% decrease compared to 213 in 2021. While our workforce continued to expand in 2022, the TRC rate decreased from 0.29 per hundred FTEs in 2021 to 0.23 in 2022.\n\nIn 2022 we recorded 81 Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC). These are occupational injury cases where an injured person is unable to work for one or more days after the injury. This represents a 29% decrease compared with 114 in 2021. The LWIC rate decreased to 0.11 per 100 FTEs in 2022, compared with 0.16 in 2021. The number of Lost Workdays caused by injuries decreased by 216 days (5%) to 4,020 days in 2022.\n\nFor more information on Health and Safety, please refer to Health and Safety performance, starting on page 284\n\n## Human rights 5.4.10\n\nPhilips strongly believes that companies have both the responsibility to respect human rights and the ability to protect them. Philips' Human Rights Policy, General Business Principles, and other relevant policies detail how Philips respects human rights, in line with the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In this regard, Philips also follows the guidance given in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Philips has also been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007. Philips' ESG Committee, composed of Executive Committee members and senior executives from businesses and functions across Philips, leads our efforts and actions. The",

The Committee also monitors progress and takes corrective action where needed.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to develop our due diligence strategy by conducting Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA). Based on an updated risk analysis, the United States was added as a country of focus for Human Rights Impact Assessments, primarily due to the size of Philips' operations in this country. To efficiently cover more sites in the future, Philips also developed a remote assessment methodology to be used in conjunction with the on-site approach, which will help to better identify locations requiring on-site visits.\n\nWhile no non-compliances were found in the two assessments carried out in 2022, ways to reduce risks concerning workers' health and safety and management of overtime were identified. There was also a lack of awareness among some production employees regarding General Business Principles reporting mechanisms, for whom the company is identifying more effective training mechanisms. Continuous support during the implementation of the action plan has been put in place.\n\nAlthough the Human Rights Impact Assessment of selected sites is primarily focused on Philips own operations, a new deep-dive approach for certain suppliers was further developed and rolled out in 2022. For eight suppliers, a focused assessment on human rights was conducted, compared with the broader Supplier sustainability assessment approach which covers sustainability more holistically and is detailed in Supplier sustainability, starting on page 25.\n\nIn 2022, we also deployed new training materials on our GBP, targeting employees without regular access to a computer, or otherwise unable to complete the online training module. For the approximately 12,000 employees who are not able to take the online General Business Principles course, an offline General Business Principles training has been created that was rolled out across various sites. Our Human Rights Report contains detailed information regarding our progress, targets, and plans for continuous improvement.\n\n## Philips Foundation 5.4.11\n\nStichting Philips Foundation, an independent foundation organized under Dutch law, is a registered charity established in 2014. In 2022, Royal Philips supported the Philips Foundation with a contribution of EUR 6.7 million, and provided the operating staff as well as the expert assistance of skilled employees in the execution of the Foundation's programs.\n\nThe Philips Foundation's mission is to reduce healthcare inequality by providing access to quality healthcare for underserved communities through meaningful innovation. It does this through the provision and application of Philips' healthcare expertise, innovation power, talent and resources and by financial support. Together with key partners around the globe\n\n(including respected NGOs such as Red Cross organizations, UNICEF, Amref and Save the Children), the Philips Foundation seeks to identify challenges where a combination of Philips expertise and partner experience can be used to create meaningful solutions that have an impact on people's lives.\n\nFor more information on the Philips Foundation, please refer to Philips Foundation, starting on page 285.\n\n## Working with stakeholders 5.4.12\n\nIn organizing ourselves around customers and markets, we conduct dialogues with our stakeholders in order to explore common ground for addressing societal challenges, building partnerships and jointly developing supporting ecosystems for our innovations around the world.\n\nAn overview of stakeholders and topics discussed is provided in ESG statements, starting on page 266.\n\nFor more information on our stakeholder engagement activities in 2022, please refer to Stakeholder engagement, starting on page 293.\n\n## Governance 5.5\n\n## Corporate governance structure 5.5.1\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. (Royal Philips), a company organized under Dutch law, is the parent company of the Philips group. Its shares have been listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange (Euronext Amsterdam) since 1912. Furthermore, its shares have been traded in the United States since 1962 and have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1987.\n\nRoyal Philips has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board, each of which is accountable to the General Meeting of Shareholders for the fulfillment of its respective duties.\n\nThe company is governed by Dutch corporate and securities laws, its Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and of the Supervisory Board respectively. Its corporate governance framework is also based on the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (dated December 8, 2016) and US laws and regulations applicable to Foreign Private Issuers. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented the Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and underlying policies, as well as separate codes of ethics that apply to employees working in specific areas of our business, i.e. the Financial Code of Ethics and the Procurement Code of Ethics.

This simplification - with end-to-end accountable businesses supported by a much leaner Group layer and a culture of patient and people centricity, innovation impact and clear accountability - is a primary enabler to drive flawless execution.\n\nIt is designed to help us to fulfill our purpose of improving the health and well-being of billions of people and ensure the highest standards of quality and integrity in everything we do.\n\n## Quality & Regulatory and patient safety 5.5.3\n\nEnabling the delivery of patient-centric, safe and high-quality care - the essence of patient safety and quality - is inextricably linked to Philips' purpose to improve the health and wellbeing of people through meaningful innovation. Patient safety and quality management represents the very foundation of our license to operate as a health technology company. Compliance with quality and regulatory standards is a pre-requisite for ensuring patient safety, which is Philips' highest priority.\n\nPhilips' reputation - and ultimately our long-term business continuity and success - fully depends on the quality and safety of our products, services and solutions for patients, customers and consumers, and on our compliance with global regulations and standards. This has never been more crucial than in this last year as we continued to remediate the devices included in the Philips Respironics recall: see section below, 'Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification'.\n\nActing with due urgency, in 2022 we accelerated our focus on patient safety and quality, with the goal of achieving and maintaining the highest level of quality. We upgraded the Quality & Regulatory leadership team with emphasis on medical technology expertise; over 90% of the renewed team has direct industry experience. We further strengthened our Post Market Surveillance global complaint handling organization and improved ways of working; this represents a significant milestone toward improving investigation and issues reporting\n\nand moving away from transactional elements of complaint handling. In addition, Philips continued to focus on harmonizing processes and enhancing the quality culture across the enterprise. Activities include training approximately 77,000 employees throughout the world on key process changes and refreshers on quality and regulatory topics.\n\nAs a global business, we must ensure compliance with various and evolving regulations and standards. In the dynamic medical technology industry, we also must stay ahead of innovation and trends such as data privacy and cybersecurity. This involves increased levels of investment to meet the competitive demands and evolving regulatory compliance activities in such areas as secure electronic transmission and storage solutions for protected personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers, consumers, patients, and workforce. For information on how Philips manages cybersecurity risk, please refer to Operational risks, starting on page 96.\n\n## Quality\n\nQuality is an integral part of the leadership and culture at Philips. Philips is committed to delivering the highest quality products, services and solutions, which are compliant with all applicable laws and quality and safety standards. We continuously strive to raise our performance in ensuring quality, which is demonstrated by the continued, substantial investment to embed quality through standardization and adoption of industry best practices throughout our Quality Management Systems and enhanced capabilities.\n\nThrough quality system improvement program activities, our aim is to enhance consistency in how we work, collaborate, and make decisions. Our critical Accelerating Patient Safety & Quality program initially focused on awareness and compliance improvements, triaging, and process design. Examples of improvements include reducing and consolidating our Quality Management Systems from 107 to 75 by year-end 2022, with further reductions planned. In 2022 we harmonized and improved consistency for a significant number of processes across Philips to enhance our best practices and implemented standard education programs tailored to specific roles plus many mandatory all-employee, quality-related courses for capability building and to demonstrate compliance. The program is now focused on further strengthening design and product reliability, and patient safety and quality culture and competencies, while continuing efforts reducing complexity. This is an ongoing journey of continuous improvement and we expect our plans to yield demonstrable progress starting in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, we updated our Quality Policy, which expresses our overall intention and direction with respect to quality. Established by management with executive responsibility, it states our objectives for, and commitment to, quality. Everyone at Philips is responsible for understanding, implementing, and maintaining the Quality Policy, and all employees now have patient safety and quality as one of five key KPIs.

These requirements outline actions from product design and pre-market submissions, production, operations, distribution, servicing and post-market management and oversight in every market we serve. These requirements include those from national government regulatory authorities (e.g. the US Food and Drug Administration and China National Medical Products Administration), Notified Bodies, and National Competent Authorities in the EU.\n\nProducts that we introduce to the market often must undergo pre-market regulatory review (e.g. pre-market approval (PMA), pre-market notification (510(k), or de novo authorization) before they can be marketed and sold in the USA as an FDA-regulated device, subjected to Notified Body review in the EU for a CE Mark, and subjected to review in China by the National Medical Products Association. If the regulatory body reviewing the submission determines that the required supporting data has not been provided, further data may be required to obtain the clearance or approval, which could prolong the process to market the product. During the lifecycle of a cleared/approved device, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a further regulatory submission and review. Regulatory bodies require each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a submission, but can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the regulatory body disagrees with a manufacturer's determination regarding whether a new submission is required for the modification of an existing device, they can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until the relevant approval/clearance is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, significant regulatory fines or other penalties may be imposed.\n\nWe also must comply with the EU's Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Energy-using Products (EuP), and other product safety regulations.\n\n## Post-market Regulation\n\nAfter a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. In the USA these include:\n\n- \u00b7 establishment of registration and device listing with the FDA;\n- \u00b7 Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;\n- \u00b7 labeling regulations and restrictions, including, for example, prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, the promotion of 'off-label' uses of cleared or approved products, or the use of false, misleading or unsubstantiated claims or statements;\n- \u00b7 requirements related to promotional activities;\n- \u00b7 clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared or, de novo -authorized devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, and approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;\n- \u00b7 medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;\n- \u00b7 correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;\n- \u00b7 the FDA's notification and recall authority, whereby the agency can order a device manufacturer to take certain actions if the FDA determines the manufacturer's device presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to public health, such as: provide notice to users and other affected stakeholders; submit a plan for the repair, replacement or refund of devices; or recall the device from the market;\n- \u00b7 post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.\n\nOur manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR and/or ISO13485, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we will be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, Notified Bodies or other relevant regulatory bodies. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or ISO 13485 requirements could result in the shut-down of, or the imposition of restrictions on, our manufacturing operations, imposition of an import alert, or the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it may lead to any of the following sanctions:\n\n- \u00b7 warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n- \u00b7 orders to issue notifications to users and other stakeholders, or to submit to the FDA a plan for the repair, replacement or refund of devices;\n- \u00b7 recalls, withdrawals or administrative detention or seizure of our products;\n- \u00b7 operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n- \u00b7 refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance, de novo authorization, or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;\n- \u00b7 withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo authorizations, or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n- \u00b7 refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or\n- \u00b7 criminal prosecution.\n\n## European Union Medical Device Regulation\n\nThe European Union Medical Device Regulation (EU-MDR) passed its date of application (May 26, 2021). For a portion of the portfolio, we used the available grace period, where products that were placed on the market under the predecessor of the EU-MDR, the European Union Medical Device Directive (EU-MDD), can continue to be placed on the market if meeting a subset of EU-MDR requirements in addition to the EU-MDD requirements. Reasons for this include stock depletion management and Notified Body capacity limitations. Throughout 2022, we made progress in transitioning some of the portfolio to become EU-MDR-compliant. We also started registering our entities and medical devices in the European Database for Medical Devices (EUDAMED) on a voluntary basis.\n\nAs the global regulatory environment continues to evolve, we are working to address the impact on cost, time and resources needed to obtain future approvals, and our ability to maintain existing approvals for our products, services, and solutions.\n\n## Philips Respironics voluntary recall and consent decree\n\nOn June 14, 2021, Philips' subsidiary, Philips Respironics, initiated a voluntary recall notification in the United States, and field safety notice outside the United States, for certain sleep and respiratory care products to address identified potential health risks related to the polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound abatement foam in these devices.\n\nThis recall let down the patients who depended on them, as well as their caregivers, and we are deeply sorry for that. We are treating this matter with the highest possible seriousness and are working to address this issue as efficiently and thoroughly as possible.\n\n- 1. Following the substantial ramp-up of production, service and repair capacity in 2021 and 2022, by year-end 2022 around 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients had been completed. In order to expedite the completion of the recall, Philips Respironics will increase the proportion of new replacement devices.\n- 2. Working with five certified, independent testing laboratories in the US and Europe and other third-party qualified experts and an external medical panel, we have been conducting a comprehensive test and research program on the PE-PUR foam to better assess and scope the potential patient health risks related to possible emissions of particulate from degraded foam and Volatile Organic Compounds related to the firstgeneration DreamStation devices. We provided an update to healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders in June 2022 and December 2022, outlining encouraging test results for the first-generation DreamStation (DS1), which accounts for over two thirds of the sleep therapy devices subjected to the recall.\n\nThe company developed and began executing a comprehensive plan to replace the PEPUR sound abatement foam used in earlier-generation devices, with the new material used in next-generation products such as DreamStation 2, which was cleared by the US FDA and approved by many competent authorities around the world. Philips Respironics has regularly been communicating progress to regulators and competent authorities around the world, as well as customers, clinicians, and patients, to complete the needed repairs and replacements associated with this recall. In certain circumstances, the products in question may be replaced or financially compensated rather than repaired.\n\nWhile third-party lab and internal testing efforts are ongoing, the company will continue with the remediation activities for all devices and continues to communicate with customers through a variety of channels.",

Philips Respironics will also continue to monitor complaints received following the recall/field safety notice via our Quality Management System, in accordance with the medical devices regulations and laws in the markets that we serve.\n\nFollowing the FDA's inspection of a Philips Respironics manufacturing facility in connection with the recall and the subsequent inspectional observations, the US DoJ, acting on behalf of the FDA, began discussions with Philips in July 2022 regarding the terms of a consent decree to resolve the identified issues. Philips is engaged in ongoing discussions with FDA and DoJ on the proposed consent decree. For more information, see Note Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\n## Consent decree - ECR\n\nIn October 2017, Philips North America LLC reached agreement on a consent decree with the US Department of Justice, representing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), related to compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements arising from inspections conducted in 2015 and prior, focusing primarily on Philips' Emergency Care & Resuscitation (ECR) business operations in Andover, Massachusetts, and Bothell, Washington.\n\nFollowing a successful inspection in Bothell, Washington, in April 2020, the FDA determined that Philips had met the conditions for resuming manufacturing and distribution of defibrillators in the US. The consent decree remains in effect for several years, during which the Emergency Care (formerly Emergency Care & Resuscitation) business will be subject to a series of annual assessments by an independent expert. Hospital Patient Monitoring (formerly Monitoring & Analytics), also named in the consent decree, is also under a heightened level of scrutiny over the same period.\n\nSubstantial progress continues to be made in our compliance efforts. In August 2021, the FDA inspected Emergency Care in Bothell as a consent decree follow-up. Three observations (Form 483) were issued and subsequently remediated and reported to the FDA. The FDA later presented Emergency Care with four Establishment Inspection Reports dating back to 2015, signaling the closure of the four open inspections. There was a consent decree followup inspection in October 2022, resulting in three observations (Form 483). These will soon be reported as fully remediated.\n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and the consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing Emergency Care or Hospital Patient Monitoring devices, recall products, pay liquidated damages, and take other actions. We cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter's ultimate impact on our business.\n\n## Remuneration policy 5.5.4\n\nOur remuneration policy is designed to encourage employees to deliver on our purpose and strategy and create stakeholder value, and to motivate and retain them. Our executive longterm incentive plan includes environmental and social commitments. A description of the composition of the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is included in Report of the Remuneration Committee, starting on page 116.\n\n## General Business Principles 5.5.5\n\nWhile pursuing our business objectives, we aim to be a responsible partner in society, acting with integrity towards our employees, customers, business partners and shareholders, as well as the wider community in which we operate. Everyone at Philips is expected to always act with integrity, and Philips rigorously enforces compliance of its General Business Principles (GBP) throughout the company.\n\nIn the highly regulated world of healthcare, integrity requires in-depth knowledge of the applicable rules and regulations and a sensitivity to healthcare-specific issues. The GBP incorporate and represent the fundamental principles by which all Philips businesses and employees around the globe must abide. They set the minimum standard for business conduct, both for individual employees and for the company and our subsidiaries. Our GBP also serve as a reference for the business conduct we expect from all our business partners.\n\nThe GBP also include principles which set our integrity standard on inside information, aiming to prevent trading on or disclosure of non-public information, the publication of which would be likely to have a significant influence on the trading price of Philips securities or securities of companies that Philips is seeking to acquire. More specifically, Philips has adopted Rules of Conduct with respect to trading in Philips securities to promote compliance with applicable insider trading and other market abuse laws, rules and regulations, in particular the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The Rules of Conduct apply to all employees, the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Royal Philips.\n\nTranslations of the GBP text are available in 30 languages, allowing almost every employee to read the GBP in their native language. Detailed underlying policies, manuals, training, and tools are in place to give employees practical guidance on how to apply and uphold the GBP in their daily work environment. Details can be found at www.philips.com/gbp.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 706 concerns were reported via Philips Speak Up (Ethics Line) and through our network of GBP Compliance Officers. This represents an increase of 16% from the total of 610 concerns in the previous reporting period (2021).",

Specifically in 2022, we once more focused on increasing awareness on Integrity and on the importance of speaking up, following up on the conclusions of the deep-dives executed after our 2021 biennial Business Integrity Survey. We believe the upward trend in reporting remains in line with our multi-year efforts to encourage our employees to express their concerns, whilst realizing that the extraordinary business conditions in the past few years make it imprudent to draw any specific conclusions from these numbers.\n\nMore information on the Philips GBP can be found in Risk management, starting on page 87.\n\nThe results of the monitoring measures in place are given in General Business Principles, starting on page 292\n\n## Risk management approach 5.5.6\n\nRisk management and control forms an integral part of the Philips business planning and performance review cycle. The company's risk management policy and framework are designed to provide reasonable assurance that its strategic and operational objectives are met, that legal requirements are complied with, and that the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures is safeguarded. Please refer to Risk management, starting on page 87 for a more detailed description of Philips' approach to risk management (including Internal Control over Financial Reporting), risk categories and factors, and certain specific risks that have been identified.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting, a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Please also refer to the statement made by the Board of Management on the basis of the outcome of this process, as included in Risk management approach , starting on page 74.\n\n## Total tax contribution 5.5.7\n\nTo fulfil our company purpose, a responsible tax approach is required. We fully acknowledge our societal role when it comes to paying taxes in the geographies where value is created. We consider our tax payments as a contribution to the communities in which we operate, as part of our social value creation.\n\nOur Approach to Tax sets the standard for our conduct, by which individual employees, the company and its subsidiaries must abide. We consider tax in the context of the broader society, inspired by our stakeholder dialogues, global initiatives of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and United Nations, human rights, international tax laws and regulations and relevant codes of conduct.\n\nUnder the ultimate responsibility of the Board of Management, the Chief Financial Officer annually reviews, evaluates, approves and where necessary adjusts Philips' Approach to Tax. Part of our approach is to acknowledge the importance of transparency in respect of our tax contributions. Philips supports and participates in transparency initiatives such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and the Tax Transparency Benchmark of the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development (VBDO). Since 2020, we have been providing certain voluntary disclosures about taxes paid and collected in the countries in which we operate. The 2022 Country Activity and Tax Report is published on our website, in addition to, and simultaneously with the disclosures on tax included in this Annual Report.\n\nPhilips also endorses the ambitions expressed in the Tax Governance Code published by Dutch employers' organization VNO-NCW. We comply with the principles prescribed in the Code, available at www.vno-ncw.nl/taxgovernancecode, and we have touched upon the elements on this code in our Country Activity and Tax Report.\n\nIn 2022, Philips contributed to the communities where we operate through taxes paid (e.g., corporate income tax) and taxes collected (e.g., VAT). Philips' total tax contribution in 2022, amounting to EUR 3,469 million, is presented by tax type in the following table.

As such, it is part of the Philips Business System (PBS). Key elements are our risk management governance, Risk appetite, the Risk management process standard, the Philips Business Control Framework, and our General Business Principles (GBP), which are further described in this chapter. There can be no absolute assurance that our risk management will avoid or mitigate all risks that Philips faces. The material risks are described in the section Risk factors, starting on page 92.\n\n## Risk management governance\n\nThe Executive Committee identifies and manages the risks Philips faces in realizing its objectives. It defines the risk appetite, provides the risk management framework, and monitors the effectiveness thereof. The Risk Management Support Team, consisting of experts on various categories of risk, supports the Executive Committee through regular analysis of the enterprise risk profile and enhancement of the risk management framework. Management is responsible for identifying critical risks and implementing appropriate risk responses within their areas of responsibility. Various functions (such as Internal Control, Quality & Regulatory, Legal, and Group Security) support the management of specific risk areas.\n\nThe Internal Audit function assesses the quality of risk management and controls through the execution of a risk-based audit plan, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Leadership from the Executive Committee, Businesses, Markets and key Functions meet quarterly with Internal Audit in Audit & Risk Committees to discuss strengths and weaknesses of risk management and controls - as evaluated by internal and external auditors and by means of other (self) assessments - and take corrective action where necessary.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee oversees the company's disclosure activities and assists the Board of Management in fulfilling its responsibilities in this respect. The Disclosure Committee ensures that the company implements and maintains internal procedures for the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information potentially subject to public disclosure under the legal, regulatory and stock exchange requirements to which the company is subject.\n\nThe GBP Review Committee is responsible for the effective deployment of the Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and for generally promoting a culture of compliance and ethics within the company. For more information see below under 'Philips General Business Principles'.\n\nThe Security Steering Committee (SSC) and the Group Security function manage security (including cybersecurity) risks. The SSC evaluates and sets the Group's security strategy, issues security policies and evaluates progress and effectiveness. Dedicated security reports are shared with the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and external auditors. On a quarterly basis, briefings on cybersecurity risks are provided to the IT Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThe Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee initiates, drives and coordinates ESG strategy development, policy setting, disclosures and planning of programs and activities in relation to our ESG commitments and obligations. It administers ESG reporting, monitors progress, assesses risks in relation to ESG and makes recommendations to the Executive Committee on our ESG endeavors.\n\nPhilips actively maintains Quality Management Systems (QMS) with the aim of ensuring the quality and safety of product design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing in compliance with regulation from various government and regulatory agencies, e.g., FDA (US), EMA (Europe), NMPA (China). Our Quality & Regulatory function closely monitors developments in the regulatory landscape. Through specialist teams at the global, regional or local level, standards and requirements are defined and continuously improved, deployed, and monitored to ensure our employees are aware of and comply with these requirements. Next to continuous improvement a program runs with the aim to accelerate patient safety and quality. A formal quality audit program assesses our organization's compliance with our QMS. Quality & safety is a standard item in personal goal setting and evaluation of all Philips' employees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees Philips' risk management, including the identified risks in relation to the Risk appetite, the response measures put in place and the effectiveness thereof. The Audit Committee and the Quality & Regulatory Committee of the Supervisory Board assist the full Supervisory Board in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee reviews the quality of risk management and controls, and the reported findings of internal and external audits. The Quality & Regulatory Committee's role particularly relates to the quality and regulatory compliance of the company's products (including software), services and systems throughout their lifecycle.",

Risk appetite is set by the Executive Committee and captured in the risk management policy. It is effectuated through our PBS, of which various elements - such as our strategy, Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and behaviors, authority schedules, policies, process standards and performance management systems - include or reflect risktaking guidance.\n\nPhilips' risk appetite differs depending on the type of risk, ranging from an averse to a seeking approach. Philips operates within the dynamics of the health technology industry and aims to take the risks needed to ensure we continually revitalize our offerings and the way we work. At the same time, Philips is committed to always act with integrity and is averse to risks impacting our GBP, which include (but not limited to) the Philips behavior 'Patient safety, Quality, and Integrity always'. Our employees are expected to ensure compliance with our GBP, laws and regulations and to act in case of concerns or violations to our GBP, please refer to the GBP section below for more information. Philips' Risk appetite for the main risk categories is visualized below. Philips does not classify these risk categories in order of importance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our process standard is designed based on the Enterprise Risk Management Framework: Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and on ISO 31000 - Risk Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey elements of the Philips risk management process are:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of Businesses, Markets and key Functions perform a risk assessment at least once a year, with updates of the strategic plan, to identify and prioritize risks, assign ownership, and implement appropriate risk responses. Risk workshops are conducted with senior management across the company to facilitate these risk assessments, and during 2022 several risk workshops were held.\n- \u00b7 Senior management discusses and monitors the risk profile and risk response effectiveness at least quarterly in its performance reviews and during Audit & Risk Committees, which cover all Businesses, Markets and selected Functions and at Group level.\n- \u00b7 Developments in the enterprise risk profile and management's initiatives to improve risk responses are discussed and monitored during the quarterly meeting of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 As an integral part of the strategy review, each year the Executive Committee assesses the enterprise risk profile and the potential risk impact versus Group risk appetite. The assessment also covers the effectiveness of the risk management framework and potential improvements thereto.\n- \u00b7 The Philips risk profile and the risk management framework are discussed at least once a year with the Supervisory Board.\n\nExamples of measures taken during 2022 to further strengthen risk management:\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to the continuous improvement of our QMS we run an enterprise-wide program Accelerating Patient Safety and Quality. This program was initiated in 2021 following the Respironics voluntary recall to evaluate and further improve our QMS, our oversight & performance management and our culture where necessary. For more information, refer to the Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70.\n- \u00b7 An enterprise-wide analysis is conducted regarding detection and reporting of product defects/failures, applying the lessons learned from the Respironics field action to each Philips business.\n- \u00b7 Various improvements to our risk management process standards in several risk areas, for example enterprise risk, product risk, and supplier- and supply-chain-related risk.\n- \u00b7 Further standardization and alignment of controls and the embedding in the global Philips standard process framework.\n- \u00b7 Risk & Compliance (R&C) community building to drive continuous improvement, knowledge sharing, capability building and risk transparency across various R&C areas.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening the risk dialogue as an integrated part of regular performance and strategy execution dialogues.\n- \u00b7 Continued improvement of our risk management capabilities in security (including cyber, product and supply chain).\n- \u00b7 Extension of our supplier risk management to deeper tiers, and diversified sourcing of high-risk components to further reduce supply dependencies.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of global warming and weather scenarios on the geographical footprint of our facilities as well as suppliers', in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing exploration and capturing of opportunities to use data analytics and automation in controls monitoring, and the ongoing deployment of our governance, risk and compliance IT solutions.\n\n## Philips Business Control Framework\n\nThe Philips Business Control Framework (PBCF) sets the standard for internal control at Philips. The objective of the PBCF is to maintain integrated management control of the company's operations and reporting, as well as safeguard compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Philips has designed its PBCF based on the COSO Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013).",

Together with Philips' established accounting procedures, this standard set of internal controls is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements. In each reporting unit, management is responsible for customizing the controls set for their business, risk profile and operations.\n\nEach year, management's accountability for ICFR is evidenced through the formal certification statement sign-off. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of ICFR that were not completely remediated are evaluated at year-end by the Board of Management. The Board of Management's report, including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of ICFR, can be found in this report in the section Management's report on internal control, starting on page 143.\n\n## Philips General Business Principles (GBP)\n\nThe GBP - part of the Philips Business System - incorporate and represent the fundamental principles by which all Philips businesses and employees around the globe must abide. They set the minimum standard for our business conduct as a health technology company, for our individual employees and for our subsidiaries. The GBP form an integral part of labor contracts in virtually every country in which Philips operates, and translations are available in 30 languages. Each year, employees reconfirm their commitment to the code of conduct after completing their GBP e-learning, and there is an additional annual sign-off for Executives. A similar sign-off is in place for Finance and Procurement staff for their respective codes of conduct. Detailed underlying policies, manuals, training, and tools are in place to give employees practical guidance on how to apply and uphold the GBP in their daily work.\n\nThe GBP Review Committee is responsible for the effective deployment of the GBP and for generally promoting a culture of compliance and ethics within the company. The Committee is chaired by the Chief ESG & Legal Officer, and its members include the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and the Chief of International Markets. Furthermore, each quarter all our key markets convene market compliance committees, which act as local satellites of the GBP Review Committee, dealing with GBP-related matters in the local context. They are also responsible for the design and execution of localized compliance plans that are tailored to their market-specific risks and organizational set-up, and regularly review the relevant compliance metrics for their respective market through dashboards delivered by the legal compliance monitoring team. The Secretariat of the GBP Review Committee, together with a worldwide network of GBP Compliance Officers, supports the organization with the implementation of GBP initiatives.\n\nAs part of our continuous effort to raise GBP awareness and foster dialogue throughout the organization, each year a global GBP communications and training plan is deployed, including structured dialogues led by managers where quality, integrity and speaking up are discussed. This is part of a company-wide initiative aimed at reinforcing a culture of dialogue using ethical dilemma case studies that are relevant to our workforce. A key control to measure implementation of our GBP is the GBP monitoring and reporting program, which is part of our Internal Control framework. In addition, we continue to expand the capabilities of our legal compliance monitoring team, serving our business customers as well as compliance networks with actionable data, thus further improving our compliance control framework.\n\nThe GBP are supported by established mechanisms with the aim of ensuring standardized reporting and enable employees and third parties to escalate concerns 24/7. Concerns raised are registered consistently in a single database hosted outside of Philips servers to ensure confidentiality and security of identity and information. Encouraging people to speak up through the available channels if they have a concern will continue to be a cornerstone of our GBP communications and awareness campaigns. At least twice a year, the GBP Review Committee, as well as the Executive Committee and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, are informed on relevant GBP metrics, cases, trends and learnings.\n\nThrough the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, the company also has procedures in place for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints specifically relating to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, which enable the confidential, anonymous submission of complaints.\n\nMore information on the Philips GBP can be found in Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 45. The GBP and underlying policies, including the Financial and Procurement Code of Ethics, are published on the company website, at https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/governance/businessprinciples.html .",

These risk factors may not, however, include all the risks that ultimately may affect Philips. Some risks not yet known to Philips, or currently believed not to be material, may ultimately have a major impact on Philips' business, revenue, income, assets, liquidity, capital resources, reputation and/or ability to achieve its business and ESG objectives. Please note that this section is not intended to describe risk that have materialized, as these are addressed in other sections and referenced to where relevant. Philips defines risks in four main categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and Financial. Philips presents the risk factors within each category in order of our current view of their expected significance. Compared to the previous year we have prioritized risk factors relating to patient safety and quality management, addressing the Respironics voluntary recall and the regulatory and legal processes connected to this, geopolitical and macro-economic factors, and to our supply chain operations. Although still relevant, we have de-emphasized risk factors related to pandemics. This does not mean that a lower-listed risk factor may not have a material and adverse impact on Philips' business, revenue, income, assets, liquidity, capital resources, reputation, and/or ability to achieve its business and ESG objectives. Furthermore, other risk factors not listed below may ultimately prove to have more significant adverse consequences than the listed risk factors.\n\nThe visual below lists our material risks and how these relate to our plan for creating value with sustainable impact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions effectively, or these actions may not achieve the anticipated effect. If specific circumstances occur or are not sufficiently mitigated, our value creation objectives could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described (including those described in forward-looking statements), could impact our ability to meet our targets, or could be detrimental to our reputation. The risk responses described below are designed to manage risks toward, and should be read in conjunction with, the Risk appetite as described above.\n\n## Strategic risks 6.3\n\n## Philips' global operations are exposed to geopolitical and macroeconomic changes\n\nPhilips' business environment can be adversely impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in global and individual markets. Mature economies are currently the main source of Philips' revenues, while growth economies are an increasing source of revenues. Philips produces, sources, and designs its products and services mainly from the United States (US), the European Union (EU) (primarily the Netherlands) and China, and the majority of Philips' assets are located in these geographies. Changes in politics and monetary, trade and tax policies in the US, the EU and China may trigger reactions and countermeasures and may also have an adverse impact on other economies and international markets in which Philips is active. Philips continues to expect global market conditions to remain highly uncertain and volatile due to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, whether or not related to or caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nPhilips observes a trend of geopolitical tensions and deglobalization which intensifies protectionism. Examples of protectionism measures are policies on trade, tariffs, sanctions, local value creation and production requirements to obtain market access, custom duties, taxation, technology and data restrictions, cyberattacks, import or export controls, talent mobility restrictions, nationalization of assets, restrictions on repatriation of returns from foreign investments, and general uncertainty on the development of local regulations and compliance thereto. Philips observes this trend in the major markets in which it operates and has a particular concern on the development of the US-China relationship and China's drive to expand its global political footprint and become self-sufficient in critical technologies, including health-related ones. If this trend continues, geopolitical relations deteriorate and economies decouple, it is expected that existing global trade and investment restrictions will remain, and further regulatory and compliance challenges for doing business globally may emerge, resulting in continued pressure on market growth and investments.\n\nUncertainty and challenges regarding various global macroeconomic factors continue to persist. Examples of general factors are an overall weakening economy, declines in economic growth projections in the US, the EU and China (which collectively account for around twothirds of Philips' sales), reduced government spending, declining customer and consumer confidence and spending, rising inflation and interest rates, and the emergence of economic impacts related to the climate crisis. Examples of healthcare-specific potential factors include rising uncertainty over the future direction of public healthcare policy and the risk of declining public investment in healthcare ecosystems.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has increased global economic and political uncertainty. Governments in the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Japan have each imposed export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and institutions in Russia, and additional controls and sanctions could be enacted in the future.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war may heighten the impact of other risks factors described herein, including but not limited to: volatility in prices for transportation, energy, commodities and other raw materials; disruptions in the global supply chain; decreased customer and consumer confidence and spending; increased cyberattacks; intensified protectionism; political and social instability; increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; rising inflation and interest rates; and constraints, volatility or disruptions in the credit and capital markets. It is possible that the conflict in Ukraine may escalate or expand and current or future sanctions and resulting geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions could be significant. We cannot predict the impact the conflict may have on the global economy in the future.\n\nChanges in geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions are difficult to predict, and the factors described above, or other factors, may lead to adverse impacts on global trade levels and flows, economic growth, and financial market and political stability, all of which could adversely affect the demand for, and supply of, Philips' products and services. This may result in a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition, and operating results. These factors could also make it more difficult to budget and to make reliable financial forecasts or could have a negative impact on Philips' access to funding.\n\nRisk response: Philips monitors economic, political, and general societal changes and, where necessary, develops response strategies to such events. High-risk markets (for example, markets exposed to high volatility) are regularly assessed for emerging risks, and if necessary, capital structure planning is performed. The Philips Group Crisis Operations team has activated response teams that are running programs on Russia and Ukraine. To be less exposed to the uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine war we actively reduced balance sheet exposure in this market, and we closely manage accounts receivable to prevent customer defaults.",

Philips establishes a strong local presence in both mature and growth geographies through market-specific strategies (for example for China, the US, and the EU). These market strategies cover various local valuecreation aspects such as innovation, manufacturing and assembly; hosting of health data; and capability development. These strategies also leverage our in-depth knowledge of healthcare, Research & Development, Quality Management Systems, sustainable global business models, and brand. This local presence enables Philips to create value and tailor its propositions to local market needs. In addition to local measures, Philips also optimizes its integrated supply chain organization, supplier base, and global manufacturing footprint to enable agile responses to large and rapid shifts in demand and supply globally.\n\n## Philips may be unable to shift to the health technology solutions and services business model\n\nWith Philips' focus on health technology, our business model is transforming from transactional, product-focused business models to outcome-oriented, multi-year customer partnerships enabled by solutions and value-added services. If this transformation is made too slowly or is not successful, Philips may not meet the expectations of patients and other stakeholders in the Health Technology business environment. It may face a loss of customer relevance, fail to capture growth, and lose market share. In addition, because of our health technology focus, Philips may have a reduced ability to offset potential negative impacts (including, but not limited to, impacts on sales, operating results, liabilities, compliance, financing) on its health technology business by other businesses through a more diversified portfolio. As a result of the shift to a solutions and services business model, Philips is becoming more dependent on a number of key customers for long-term recurring revenues, thus increasing the risk that the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers could cause a significant decline in our revenues. Any of these factors may have a material adverse impact on Philips' brand value and reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. More specific Health Technology risks and their potential impacts are included in the Operational, Financial and Compliance risk sections below as well as in the Note Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\nRisk response: Philips is running multiple interconnected initiatives intended to enable, strengthen and accelerate various aspects our business model to the standards of the Health Technology solutions business environment including, but not limited to, patient safety, quality, innovation, social, the shift of our solutions business model, productivity and compliance. For examples of responses to these various aspects we refer to the related risk factors in this section, Examples of initiatives to shift from a transactional to a solutions business model are mentioned here. We pursue the end-to-end alignment of our governance, processes and IT systems to our solution offerings. We are making our solutions available through SaaS and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). We are also expanding digital customer engagement and e-commerce channels, as well as activation of our solutions in markets.\n\nWhere Philips engages in long-term service-based business models, we aim to run a disciplined deal process with strict acceptance criteria. It is noted that although our portfolio is focused on health technology, it covers various products, solutions and services across the health continuum without significant dependence on a single product, solution, service or market.\n\n## Philips may be unable to gain leadership in health informatics\n\nNew digital technologies and ways of conducting business are fundamentally changing the health technology industry, and thus our competitive business environment. A key trend, started in radiology, is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to drive quality and efficiency in clinical and operational workflows. Another trend, accelerated by the pandemic, is the shift toward cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) business models and remotely upgradable and serviceable systems with suites of apps. These new types of offerings are enabled by hybrid cloud/on-premise digital platforms. Our informatics and systems businesses may fall behind established and new 'born digital' competitors if Philips fails to, in a timely way, develop the requisite capabilities, adjust its business models, and find ways to globally commercialize new products and services at scale. This could result in an inability to satisfy customer and patient needs, thereby missing out on revenue and margin growth opportunities, which may have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips runs a coherent set of initiatives to accelerate the transformation of informatics-enabled propositions. Some examples of these initiatives are mentioned here (without limitation). We are moving existing informatics propositions (such as Radiology PACS and image viewing) to the cloud, with a SaaS business model. This is done in an end-to-end approach, including IT backbone and go-to-market adjustments. We are developing new informatics propositions with explicit data and AI strategies, such as acute care management with clinical decision support. We are extending our HealthSuite Platform (HSP) with state-ofthe-art data and AI capabilities, enabling Philips businesses to easily generate AI enabled applications that can offer insights at scale to our customers. We are accelerating the roll out of our global cloud strategy, together with leading industry partners, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). We are also transforming our traditional modality businesses, such as imaging and monitoring, toward offering 'software defined systems' with features, functions, and services that are primarily defined in software and continually upgraded over the lifetime to enable continuous value delivery to our customers (such as the enhancement of magnetic resonance systems with AI-based reconstruction or remote sensing capabilities, and preventative maintenance services).",

We may not be able to successfully or efficiently integrate new acquisitions with our existing operations, culture and systems, which may expose Philips to risks in areas such as sales and service, logistics, quality, regulatory compliance, legal claims, information technology and finance. Integration challenges may adversely impact the realization of value creation expectations. Transactions may incur significant costs, result in unforeseen operating difficulties, divert management attention from other business priorities, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Cost savings expected to be implemented, or other assumptions underlying the business case relating to a particular acquisition, may not be realized. If we are unable to accomplish any of our objectives in respect of any of our new acquisitions, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may experience lower than anticipated profits, or even incur losses. Acquisitions may also lead to a substantial increase in long-lived assets, including goodwill, which may later be subject to write-down if an acquired business does not perform as expected, which may have a material adverse effect on Philips' earnings.\n\nRisk response: Philips has an active acquisition allocation strategy and roadmap per growth area to ensure organizational fit. Philips aims to use a structured and disciplined acquisition process with strict acceptance criteria, budgets and tollgates, and time allocated for critical review of due diligence, including integration risks and expected integration benefits. A broad range of internal and external functional experts are involved in this process. Philips develops and deploys a high-quality post-acquisition integration playbook with set milestones and conducts value-creation progress reviews with the responsible business leader throughout the integration of each acquisition.\n\n## Philips may be unable to meet internal or external aims or expectations with respect to ESG-related matters\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors may directly and indirectly impact the business environment in which Philips operates. Philips may, from time to time, disclose ESGrelated initiatives or aims in connection with the conduct of its business and operations (for example, with respect to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chain). However, there is no guarantee that Philips will be able to implement such initiatives or meet such aims within anticipated timeframes, or at all. In addition, there is an increasing focus from Philips' stakeholders - including customers, employees, regulators, and investors - on ESG matters, and those stakeholders may also have ESG-related expectations with respect to Philips' business and operations. For example, customers may focus on ESG-related criteria in buying our products, and any inability by Philips to address concerns about ESG-related matters could negatively impact sentiment towards Philips and our products and brands.\n\nThere are an increasing number of regulatory and legislative initiatives in the EU and other\n\njurisdictions to address ESG issues, which will or may (if implemented) require Philips to significantly increase the scope of mandatory ESG disclosures. They will or may (if implemented) require Philips to identify and act on adverse environmental and human rights impacts across the organization and potentially the entire value chain, beyond our current efforts. These regulatory and legislative initiatives, in turn, could also affect how customers or other stakeholders perceive our products or business operations. If our products or business operations do not meet the criteria for sustainability according to, for example, the EU Taxonomy Regulation (including the related delegated regulations) or any other similar regulations, this may negatively affect how customers or other stakeholders view Philips. Philips may fail to fulfill internal or external ESG-related initiatives, aims or expectations, or be perceived to do so, or we may fail adequately or accurately to report performance or developments with respect to such initiatives, aims or expectations. In addition, Philips could be criticized or held responsible for the scope of its initiatives or goals regarding ESG matters. Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on Philips' reputation and brand value, or on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: We have raised our 2025 ESG commitments and have adopted a comprehensive ESG framework. Environmental: We are working to minimize our impact on the planet by taking climate action, driving the transition to a circular economy, implementing EcoDesign in our products, and partnering with our suppliers to reduce their environmental footprint. Social: We aim to deliver social impact by improving people's health and wellbeing, offering the best place to work, and engaging with our suppliers and the communities where we operate. Governance: At Philips, everything we do is anchored by ethical and responsible practices. Our management structure, operating model, ethics framework and robust risk management help us maintain the highest standards. We have established an ESG Committee that monitors progress and assesses risks in relation to our ESG strategy, and it makes recommendations to the Executive Committee on the continuous improvement of our ESG endeavors. For more information, please refer to the chapter in this report.\n\n## Philips may be unable to secure and maintain intellectual property rights for its products and services or may infringe others' intellectual property rights\n\nPhilips is dependent on its ability to obtain and maintain licenses and other intellectual property (IP) rights covering its products and services and its design and manufacturing processes. The IP portfolio is the result of an extensive IP generation process that could be influenced by a number of factors, including innovation and acquisitions. The value of the IP portfolio is dependent on the successful promotion and market acceptance of standards (co)developed by Philips. This is particularly applicable to the segment 'Other', where licenses from Philips to third parties generate IP royalties and are important to Philips' results of operations. The timing of licenses from Philips to third parties and associated revenues from IP royalties are uncertain and may vary significantly from period to period. Additionally,",

A loss or impairment in connection with such licenses to third parties could have a material adverse impact on Philips' financial condition and operating results. Philips is also exposed to the risk that a third party may claim to own IP rights to technology applied in Philips' products and services. If any such claims of infringement of these IP rights are successful, Philips may be required to pay damages to such third parties or may incur other costs or losses.\n\nRisk response: Philips has an Intellectual Property & Standards organization (IP&S) that proactively pursues the creation of new IP and the protection of existing IP in close cooperation with Philips' operating businesses and the Innovation & Strategy function. IP&S is a leading industrial IP organization providing IP solutions to Philips' businesses to support their growth, competitiveness and profitability. In addition, Philips aims its business as a whole not to be materially dependent on any particular third-party patent or license, or any particular group of third-party patents and licenses.\n\n## Operational risks 6.4\n\n## Products and services may fail quality or security standards, which may adversely affect patient safety and customer operations\n\nThe safety of patients and our reputation depends on the safety and quality of our products and services. Our products and services, either new and/or in field use by our customers, may fail to meet product quality or product security standards. In particular, Philips is exposed to the ongoing impact of the Respironics voluntary recall and related matters. Please refer to the section Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70 and the Note Contingencies, starting on page 204. If products fail to meet product quality and/ or security standards, this may cause (patient) harm, negatively impact customer operations and their ability to provide healthcare, provide unauthorized access to patient records and medical devices through cybersecurity incidents or generally cause customer dissatisfaction. Given Philips' focus on health technology, products and services often require regulatory approvals, including approval of quality and benefit/risk prior to market introduction. Many of our products also have multiple software components, which may be exposed to security threats, including potentially in the event of obsolescence or insufficient maintenance. Issues with the quality or security of our products and services can occur as a result of various factors, including product design, production, suppliers, materials used, installation, or newly emerging and rapidly evolving cybersecurity threats. These (and other) issues could cause events that need to be actively addressed, which may lead to (amongst others) higher costs of design, market de-activation, stop use, field recalls and repairs, financial claims and liabilities, damage to our brand reputation, competitive disadvantage, regulatory noncompliance (refer to the section Compliance risks, starting on page 103), consent decrees or\n\nlosing our license to operate for products or access to markets. Any of these may have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based control systems to detect defects or other errors in our products before they are released, our business ultimately relies on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. These events are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. In addition to human error, our quality controls are also subject to overriding, as well as resource or technical constraints. As such, these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects or errors in our products before they have been released into the marketplace. In such an event, the technological reliability and safety of our products could be below our standards, and our reputation, brand and sales could be adversely affected. In addition, we could be required to, or may find it necessary to, offer a refund for the product or service, suspend the availability or sale of the product or service, or expend significant resources to cure the defect or error. Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on Philips' reputation and brand value, or on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips is committed to delivering the highest-quality products, services and solutions compliant with all applicable laws and standards, and patient safety is paramount to everything we do. We design, produce, and supply our products and services with a focus on safety, security and effectiveness. Post-market surveillance processes monitor our devices after release to market to attempt to uncover emerging issues as early as possible. The quality of production and performance of our critical suppliers is also monitored closely. A cybersafe program is running to address obsolescence issues.\n\nWe continuously invest substantially in embedding quality in our organizational culture as well as consolidating and standardizing our Quality Management Systems (QMS). We run an enterprise-wide program Accelerating Patient Safety and Quality. This program was initiated in 2021 following the Respironics voluntary recall to evaluate and further improve our QMS, our oversight & performance management and our culture where necessary. A formal quality audit program assesses our organization's compliance with our QMS. With consistency of purpose, top-down accountability, consolidation, standardization and continuous improvement, we aim to drive the adoption of a quality mindset as well as improved quality and safety outcomes throughout the enterprise. Quality is an integral part of the evaluation of all levels of management. While we believe our processes have become more robust, continuing to enhance our quality culture remains a top priority. We perform extensive programs to monitor and evaluate product performance, and we correct or remove any product from service that presents harm to patients or users. In the event of issues, we run extensive programs with the goal of recalling, repairing or replacing affected products and",

For example, in June 2021, our subsidiary, Respironics, initiated a voluntary recall notification for certain sleep and respiratory care products to address identified potential health risks and substantially ramped up the production, service and repair capacity. In 2022, Respironics continued to make progress with the repair and replacement program and the comprehensive test and research program for the affected devices. As of January 2023, around 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients has been completed. In order to expedite the remaining 10% of the affected devices, Philips Respironics will increase the proportion of replacement devices.\n\nFor further details refer to section Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70, the Notes Provisions, starting on page 193 and Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\n## Philips may be unable to ensure a resilient supply chain\n\nMost of Philips' operations are conducted internationally, which exposes Philips to supply chain challenges and uncertainties. Philips produces and procures products and parts in various countries globally, including Asian countries. Disruption to production in, and shipping from, Asian countries could have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to disruptions in other markets. The production and shipping of products and parts, whether from Philips or from third parties, could be interrupted by various external factors, such as geopolitics (for example, US-China relations and protectionist measures taken in other markets), regional conflicts, natural disasters or extreme weather events (the effects of which may be exacerbated by climate change), container imbalances, port congestions, and continued uncertainty related to COVID-19 measures (particularly in China). Throughout 2022 we experienced supply chain headwinds and expect these to continue throughout 2023. Currently, components are scarce. Global supply constraints and cost impacts as a result of worldwide economic disruptions, electronic component shortages, fear of future or ongoing pandemics, inflation, and geopolitical events, including the war in Ukraine, are impacting our ability to procure components. Obtaining alternative sources of components could involve significant costs and regulatory challenges and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. As a health technology company, Philips is dependent on the availability of components, including semiconductors. Semiconductors have been subject to an ongoing global supply shortage. At the same time our product design may include obsolescent semiconductors and other components. If semiconductor shortage continues, we may experience delays, production interruptions, increased costs, the need to make engineering design changes or the inability to fulfill customer demand, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Philips, our customers, our suppliers, and our third-party service providers may also be exposed to labor shortages, potentially as a result of COVID-19. These factors may cause increased lead times and adversely impact our production capacity, which may negatively impact the delivery of products and services to customers, for example the postponement of equipment installations in hospitals. If Philips is not able to respond swiftly to those factors, this may\n\nresult in an inability to deliver on customer needs, ultimately resulting in loss of revenue and margin.\n\nA general shortage of energy, materials, (sub-)components or means of transportation may drive fluctuations in price. Philips purchases raw materials, including rare-earth metals, copper, steel, aluminum, noble gases and oil-related products. There is no assurance that these raw materials will be available for purchase in the future. The actions by the governments in the US, UK, and the EU in response to the war between Russia and Ukraine, among other factors, have had an adverse impact on the cost of the raw materials that we purchase. Commodities have been subject to volatile markets, and such volatility is expected to continue and costs to increase. Costs may also increase as a result of stricter climatechange-related laws and regulations. Such legislation could require investments in technology to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, beyond what we expect in our existing plans, or could result in additional and increased carbon pricing. If Philips is not able to compensate for increased costs of energy, (sub-)components, (raw) materials and transportation - either by reducing reliance thereon or passing on increased costs to customers - then price increases could have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nPhilips may increase its dependency on a concentration of external suppliers, as a result of the continuing process of creating a leaner supply base and launching initiatives to replace internal capabilities with less costly outsourced products and services. These initiatives also need to be balanced with local-market value-creation requirements, including those relating to local manufacturing and data storage. Although Philips works closely with its suppliers to avoid supply discontinuities, there can be no assurance that Philips will not encounter future supply issues, causing disruptions or unfavorable conditions.\n\nRisk response: Philips is extending the simplification of its portfolio and its Design for Excellence approach to the full value chain, which includes designing products in such a way that supply dependencies are minimized (for example, redesigning our printed circuit boards to qualify alternate sources of supply). Furthermore, we are optimizing our supplier base, manufacturing, and warehousing footprint to enable agile responses to shifts in demand and supply, as well as a changing geopolitical risk landscape. Philips is engaging with senior government officials, strategic suppliers and foundries to prioritize healthcare supplies, directly working on component issues across all tiers of suppliers and diversifying sourcing of high-risk components. Philips is making balanced investments in global and local supply chain capabilities to reduce dependencies and lead times, and to meet local market requirements.\n\nPhilips has deployed an integrated risk management framework to assess and manage suppliers from various perspectives, such as strategic fit, financial stability, operational performance and quality, sustainability, compliance, and location. We also maintain close",

We run various global warming and weather scenarios on the geographical footprint of our facilities, as well as our suppliers', in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n\nPhilips manages carbon pricing risk by reducing its full value-chain carbon footprint, as well as partnering with suppliers to reduce their environmental footprint and closely monitor carbon regulations, including carbon taxes. Philips manages the risk of rising commodity prices by several means, including engaging in long-term contracts and keeping physical inventories. Philips closely monitors price developments and takes pricing action where appropriate.\n\n## Philips may face challenges in connection with its strategy to improve execution and other business performance initiatives\n\nAs announced in January 2023, Philips has prioritized the further strengthening of our patient safety and quality management, our supply chain operations, and the simplification of the organization and the ways we work. If we do not effectively manage the necessary changes, including any upgrades to Philips' IT architecture, this may result in us not realizing our business ambitions with respect to growth, safety, quality, operational excellence, productivity and solutions delivery, amongst others, and/or may cause business discontinuities. There can be no assurance that the recently announced changes in operating model will be successful in supporting Philips' strategy or improving Philips' results of operations, and Philips may need to undertake further restructurings in the future. If the recently announced restructuring or any future restructurings ultimately prove unsuccessful or have a material adverse effect on Philips' reputation and brand value, Philips' business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPhilips continually seeks to create a more open, standardized, and cost-effective IT landscape. Approaches include further outsourcing, offshoring, commoditization, and ongoing reduction in the number of IT systems. These changes create third-party dependency risks regarding the delivery of IT services, the availability of IT systems, and the functionality offered by IT systems. Although Philips has sought to strengthen security measures and quality controls relating to these systems, these measures may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful, which may lead to a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips runs a process to simplify the way we work, to drive accountability and agility and to unlock significant productivity and margin gains. This simplification is a primary enabler for flawless execution. Philips has a dedicated business transformation and IT implementation organization that drives end-to-end orchestration of this change. To enable change, Philips has adopted several practices to drive a culture of performance and to ensure programs are effective. These practices include Lean and Agile, change management, project management, knowledge management, and performance management. Philips is rolling out an Enterprise Process Framework to simplify and standardize our business processes and supporting enterprise (IT) architecture.\n\nPhilips uses a structured IT risk management method to identify and address risks to our critical business applications. Our ongoing IT Business Continuity Management activities include real-time monitoring of availability, redundancies, testing, and upgrading of applications. We regularly validate IT systems and continuously improve our IT change management capabilities to make sure that every change of an IT system is executed in a controlled way and sufficiently tested to minimize the impact of business disruptions due to failure of the system. Philips has deployed a global Business Continuity Management System, which includes a global early warning system for operational threats and is certified against ISO 22301:2019, the international standard for Business Continuity.\n\n## Philips is dependent on its people for leadership and specialized skills and may be unable to attract and retain such personnel\n\nIn October 2022 and January 2023, Philips announced a series of reductions in workforce. These restructuring measures may negatively impact Philips' reputation and its ability to attract and retain employees whose skills and experience are important for its business. Layoffs of skilled employees may subject Philips to potential employment lawsuits and benefit Philips' competitors. Philips' restructuring measures may also pose operational challenges and place a substantial strain on remaining management and employees. The reduction in workforce may adversely affect the pace and breadth of Philips' research and development efforts. The diversion of management time to planning and implementing any restructuring measures may also cause disruptions to Philips' business.\n\nThe attraction and retention of talented employees is critical to Philips' success, and the loss of employees with specialized skills could result in business interruptions. There is fierce competition for talent in key capability segments, and there is a heightened expectation of attrition post-pandemic. The announced organizational restructuring may also impact employee engagement. These factors may affect Philips' ability to attract and retain critical talent. Post-COVID-19 adjustments such as hybrid working may continue to present challenges to team interactions and the onboarding of new people. If employees perceive our post-COVID-19 approach to working to be inadequate, overly burdensome, or prefer the safety or convenience of working from home, employees may choose to terminate their employment with us, productivity may decline, or we may experience employee unrest,",

Philips is competing for the best talent and most sought-after skills, and there is no assurance of succeeding compared to other companies in attracting and retaining the highly qualified employees needed in the future. Wage inflation is increasing the competition for talent and the cost of labor. This may negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic imperatives, and if we are unable to offset the increased costs of labor through higher selling prices, then rising costs could also have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips continuously assesses capability gaps for its key positions and has initiatives in place to close any employee capability gaps. This includes monitoring and understanding the drivers behind attrition, maintaining appropriate remuneration structures aimed at attracting and retaining talent, and leveraging its purpose and contribution to societal and environmental challenges, as a differentiating proposition for employees. Philips measures employee engagement through regular surveys and benchmarks the results across the organization against high-performing external norms. Philips performs deep-dives where necessary and drives improvement actions to address any gaps. For example, the company is running a Future of Work program to drive a hybrid-model approach, with continued emphasis on embracing flexibility, being at our best, and engaging in impactful collaboration.\n\n## Philips could be exposed to a significant enterprise cybersecurity breach\n\nPhilips relies on information technology to operate and manage its businesses and store and process confidential data (relating to patients, employees, customers, intellectual property, suppliers and other partners). Philips' products, solutions and services increasingly contain sophisticated and complex information technology. The healthcare industry is subject to strict privacy, security and safety regulations with regard to a wide range of health information. At the same time, geopolitical conflicts and criminal activity continue to drive increases in the number, severity, and sophistication of cyberattacks globally. Considering the general increase in cybercrime, our customers and other stakeholders are becoming more demanding regarding the cybersecurity of our products and services. As a global health technology company, Philips is inherently and increasingly exposed to the risk of cyberattacks and potential impact of attacks on our suppliers. Information systems may be damaged, disrupted (including the provision of services to customers), or shut down due to cyberattacks. In addition, breaches in the security of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers, or other partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information (including intellectual property) or personal data belonging to us or our employees, customers, suppliers or other partners. These risks are particularly significant with respect to patient medical records. Cyberattacks may result in substantial costs and other negative consequences, which may include, but are not limited to, lost revenues, reputational damage, remediation and enhancement costs, penalties, and other liabilities to regulators, customers and other partners. Philips has not encountered any material breaches or other cybersecurity incidents in 2022. While Philips deals with the operational threat of cybercrime on a continuous basis and has so far been\n\nable to prevent significant damage or significant monetary cost in taking corrective action, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not result in significant or other consequences than as described above, which may result in a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips has established a Group Security function and implemented security management processes and controls, and monitors risk trends on material security topics, such as the risk of security breaches and ransomware attacks, in our information systems and our products and services. The Philips Security Steering Committee continually monitors the risks, as well as required investments and progress made on the programs to reduce security risk. Risk workshops are held across the company to calibrate cybersecurity risks and the appropriate risk appetite. Philips is deploying security risk management further into our businesses and functions to enhance the completeness and quality of overall risk reporting, and management of identified improvement actions.\n\nPhilips assesses and continuously improves key security controls (e.g., strengthening endpoints, email security, and network security, and conducting global vulnerability scans, including mitigation of vulnerabilities). We have strengthened the IT function to assure IT systems are kept up to date and applications are designed and developed with security in mind. We run initiatives to enhance security awareness for all Philips staff. For example, there are mandatory security trainings and specific phishing training, and we give additional focus to groups who need it across the company. Philips evaluates its supply chain and continuously monitors the security maturity of critical suppliers, as well as their performance against contractually agreed security standards. Philips has also strengthened its procurement process for security. Philips also continuously improves the Philips Business System to ensure adequate security management of products and services via the Quality Management Systems. Philips maintains relationships and cooperates with several government intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as with healthcare -specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Cyber Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), to remain abreast of new threats.",

The emergence of new low-cost competitors, particularly in Asia, further underlines the importance of improvements in the innovation process. Success in launching innovations depends on a number of factors, including development of value propositions, architecture and platform creation, product development, market acceptance, production, and delivery ramp-up. It is also dependent on addressing potential quality issues or other defects in the early stages of introduction, and on attracting and retaining skilled employees. Costs of developing new products and solutions may partially be reflected on Philips' balance sheet and may be subject to writedown or impairment depending on the performance of such products or services. The significance and timing of such write-downs or impairments are uncertain, as is the ultimate commercial success of new product introductions. Accordingly, Philips cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that innovations will have on its financial condition and operating results. If Philips fails to create and commercialize its innovations at scale, it may lose market share and competitiveness, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips is in continuous dialogue with customers to better understand their needs and to reaffirm that its strategy is translated into a balanced portfolio of products, software, services and integrated solutions with a corresponding innovation pipeline. Philips transformed its marketing to accelerate the understanding of rapidly evolving customer needs and to translate that understanding into integrated value propositions. Philips is also driving the Customer First Innovation transformation to accelerate its innovation ambitions and effectiveness across all elements of the Philips Business System. The focus is on digital platform-based solutions and software-defined systems, leveraging data and AI at scale, and enabling delivery of informatics and system-related applications with a Software as a Service business model. Furthermore, Philips runs initiatives to rationalize our Research & Development (R&D) footprint and to prioritize R&D projects. Ways of working are anchored in standardized processes and tools in all aspects of customer-needs-focused innovation (from exploration to launch in the market and eventually customer success management). In addition, a number of initiatives are running to improve innovation capabilities, in areas such as software and systems engineering, data and AI, and usability. Finally, Product Design Centers have been set up to take responsibility for common modules used by multiple businesses, such as wireless connectivity modules and batteries. These initiatives, taken together, will improve innovation effectiveness, efficiency, quality, and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Pandemics could have an adverse effect on Philips' operations and employees\n\nAlthough the ability to manage pandemics (for example, resurgences of COVID-19 or mutations thereof) has improved, pandemics may continue to affect Philips' operations and results in 2023 and Philips expects uncertainty and volatility related to the impact of pandemics and the local response policies thereto, in China in particular given our footprint in China and recent developments in China to loosen restrictions and countervailing measures imposed by other countries. This is driven by, among other things, the extent and depth of government policies to restrict the spread of viruses, the effectiveness of vaccination programs, the appearance of mutations, and the emergence of new viruses that may cause new pandemics. COVID-19 and other pandemics may continue to impact delivery on our triple duty of care in various ways: the health and safety of our employees (in our various working environments); meeting critical customer needs (for example, our production capacity and our ability to deliver, install and provide services); and business continuity (for example, our functional operations, supply chain, and commercial processes). In 2022, we have gradually reopened our offices mostly applying a hybrid schedule. For further discussion or the risks related to hybrid working, see the risk factor 'Philips is dependent on its people for leadership and specialized skills and may be unable to attract and retain such personnel'. The expectation remains that responses to the risks of COVID-19 continue to require effort and expense and may negatively affect Philips' business, financial conditions, and results of operations. In addition, Philips' customers may not yet be fully focused on making new investments in medical equipment while recovering from COVID-19 disruptions, or they may be facing liquidity issues caused by COVID-19, which may adversely impact Philips' revenue and cash flow generation.\n\nRisk response: The Philips Group Crisis Operations team has activated a comprehensive COVID-19 response program, which is continuously maturing and helps Philips be better prepared to respond to future events. Philips' response measures are focused on delivering on its triple duty of care:\n\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding the health and safety of employees, including personal hygiene measures and safety protocols, work-from-home protocol, safe working environments, personal protective equipment, and remote servicing capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Meeting critical customer needs, including production volume ramp-up, delivery and installation of critical equipment, fair and ethical allocation of scarce equipment and supplies, customer services, updated clinical guidance, increased cloud-enabled telehealth, remote patient engagement and hub-and-spoke models.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring business continuity, including liquidity measures and our Business Continuity Management System covering functional operations, the integrated supply chain and commercial processes.",

If the markets expect a downgrade by the rating agencies, or if such a downgrade has actually taken place, this could increase the cost of borrowing, reduce our potential investor base and adversely affect our business.\n\nPhilips' financing and liquidity position may also impact its ability to implement or complete any share-buyback program or distribute any dividends in accordance with its dividend policy or at all. Any announced share-buyback program or dividend policy may also be amended, suspended or terminated at any time, including at Philips' discretion or as a result of applicable law, regulation or regulatory guidance, and any such amendment, suspension or termination could negatively affect the trading price of, increase trading price volatility of, or reduce the market liquidity of Philips' shares or other securities. Additionally, any sharebuyback program or distribution of dividend could diminish Philips' cash or other reserves, which may impact its ability to finance future growth and to pursue potential future strategic opportunities. Any share-buyback program or dividend payment will depend on factors such as availability of financing, liquidity position, business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance, the state of the market and the general economic climate, and other factors, including tax and other regulatory considerations. Philips and its subsidiaries may also be subject to limitations on the distribution of shareholders' equity under applicable law.\n\nPhilips operates in over 100 countries and its reported earnings and equity are therefore inevitably exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies against the euro. Philips' sales and net investments in its foreign subsidiaries are sensitive in particular to movements in the US dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, and a wide range of other currencies from developed and emerging economies. Philips' sourcing and manufacturing spend is concentrated in the EU, the US and China. Income from operations is particularly sensitive to movements in currencies of countries where Philips has no or very small-scale manufacturing/local sourcing activities but significant sales of its products or services, such as Japan, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and a range of emerging markets, such as South Korea, Indonesia, India and Brazil. Philips' operations in all segments were scaled back in Russia and Ukraine in 2022, which together represented less than 2% of group sales in 2021 and in 2022. The asset value of the activities in Russia and Ukraine were less than 1% of the consolidated total assets of the group as of December 31, 2022. While there have been no significant asset write-downs to date in Russia and Ukraine, we continue to closely monitor developments in this regard.\n\nIn view of the long lifecycle of health technology solution sales and long-term strategic partnerships, the financial risk of counterparties with outstanding payment obligations creates exposure risks for Philips, particularly in relation to accounts receivable from customers, liquid assets, and the fair value of derivatives and insurance contracts with financial counterparties. A default by counterparties in such transactions can have a material adverse effect on Philips' financial condition and operating results.\n\nContingent liabilities may have a significant impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For an overview of current cases please refer to the Note Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\nRisk response: At Philips, liquidity is monitored by the Group Treasury department, which tracks the actual cash flow for the Group against forecasts of the liquidity requirements on both a short- and longer-term basis. This includes regular reviews of liquidity versus credit rating constraints to manage the risk of potential downgrades in credit ratings. Philips manages the available liquidity for the Group in several ways, e.g., by spreading maturities of external debt over time and by having appropriate standby credit facilities available. As an example, in the second quarter of 2022, Philips issued EUR 750 million fixed-rate notes due 2027, EUR 650 million Green Innovation Notes due 2029, and EUR 600 million Sustainability Innovation Notes due 2033 under its Euro Medium Term Note program. Philips also entered into a series of transactions to extend and optimize the company's debt maturity profile.\n\nPhilips hedges the anticipated net exposure of developed-market foreign currencies resulting from sales, purchases and net investments in its foreign subsidiaries in those currencies. For emerging markets, Philips mainly relies on pricing adjustments for its products and services to counteract any expected depreciation of emerging-market currencies. Philips performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and other counterparties and uses various tools to manage the credit risks.\n\nPlease also refer to the Note Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 218.\n\n## Philips is exposed to tax risks which could have a significant adverse financial impact\n\nPhilips is exposed to tax risks which could result in double taxation, penalties and interest payments. The source of the risks could originate from local tax rules and regulations as well as international and EU regulatory frameworks. These include transfer pricing risks on internal cross-border deliveries of goods and services, as well as tax risks relating to changes in the transfer pricing model. Examples of initiatives that may result in changing tax rules and regulations include, but are not limited to, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework to address the allocation of income to user markets ('Pillar One') and a 15 per cent. minimum income tax rate ('Pillar Two'). The formal adoption of Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (the 'Pillar Two Directive') in December 2022 aims to achieve a coordinated implementation of Pillar",

However, Philips may be affected by the 'MTR Act' following its implementation, which is expected to occur on 1 January 2024, and other regulations and rules that have been, or will be, enacted to implement Pillar Two (for example, any implementing acts in EU Member States in respect of the 'Pillar Two Directive'). This may impose an additional tax burden and increase Philips' tax compliance requirements. Furthermore, Philips is exposed to tax risks related to acquisitions and divestments, permanent establishments, tax loss, interest and tax credits carried forward, and potential changes in tax law that could result in higher tax expenses and payments. The risks may have a significant impact on local financial tax results, which, in turn, could adversely affect Philips' financial condition and operating results. The value of the deferred tax assets, such as tax losses carried forward, is subject to the availability of sufficient taxable income within the tax loss-carry-forward period. It is also subject to the availability of sufficient taxable income within the foreseeable future, in the case of tax losses carried forward with an indefinite carry-forward period. The ultimate realization of the company's deferred tax assets is uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no absolute assurance that all deferred tax assets, such as (net) tax losses and credits carried forward, will be realized.\n\nRisk response: Philips' tax policy, strategy and planning provides overarching governance. The Philips global tax organization designs and implements this and provides tax advice, ensures tax compliance, including accounting and reporting, and deploys our tax risk management and control framework to ensure adherence to up-to-date tax policies. The Group Tax department is in charge of establishing, maintaining and overseeing the tax policies. Potential risks are carefully monitored and dealt with by tax specialists from relevant areas (e.g., corporate income tax, transfer pricing, indirect taxes, wage tax and tax accounting). In monthly reviews, a group of Market Tax Managers helps manage the risks and overall tax governance by applying their knowledge of local markets (e.g., introduction of new tax law), among others.\n\nPlease also refer to the disclosure in the Note Income taxes, starting on page 168 and the Country Activity and Tax Report.\n\n## Flaws in internal controls could adversely affect our financial reporting and management process\n\nAccurate disclosures provide investors and other market professionals with significant information for a better understanding of Philips' businesses. Failures in internal controls or other issues with respect to Philips' public disclosures, including disclosures with respect to cybersecurity risks and incidents, could create market uncertainty regarding the reliability of the information (including financial data) presented. This could have a negative impact on\n\nthe price of Philips securities. In addition, the reliability of revenue and expenditure data is key for steering the businesses and for managing top-line and bottom-line growth. The long lifecycle of health technology solution sales, from order acceptance to accepted installation and servicing, together with the complexity of the accounting rules recognizing revenue in the accounts, presents a challenge in terms of ensuring consistent and correct application of the accounting rules throughout Philips' global business. Significant changes in the way of working, such as hybrid working and shifting processes to remote Global Business Services locations, may have an adverse impact on the control environment under which controls are executed, monitored, reviewed and tested. Any flaws in internal controls, or regulatory or investor actions in connection with flaws in internal controls, could have a material adverse effect on Philips' business, financial condition, operation results, and reputation and brand.\n\nRisk response: Philips' Business Control Framework (PBCF) sets the standard for risk management and internal control over financial reporting. Key components of our PCBF are the standards on management testing of controls and our Financial Code of Ethics. The code is designed to deter wrongdoings; to promote honest and ethical conduct; to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosures, and to encourage internal reporting of (suspected) violations. Please also refer to the section Our approach to risk management, starting on page 88 for more information on our PBCF.\n\n## Global inflation could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations\n\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, the conflict in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely, in turn, to lead to increased interest rates and adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital. These inflationary pressures could affect our manufacturing costs, operating expenses (including wages), and other expenses. We may not be able to compensate for increased costs by driving productivity to reduce costs and by passing these cost increases on through price measures in a timely manner, if at all, which could have an impact on our gross margins and profitability. Inflation may also cause our customers to reduce or delay orders for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nRisk response: To improve agility and productivity Philips has stepped up its performance initiatives to remove organizational complexity, optimize quality and simplify ways of working. These initiatives relate to, however are not limited to, the following areas. Procurement spend reduction through for consolidation of suppliers and leveraging low-cost locations. We maintain close relationships with our suppliers and maintain an ongoing dialogue to align our demand forecast to their supply allocation and manage the risk of rising prices by several means, including engaging in long-term contracts and keeping physical inventories. Supply chain cost reductions through rationalization of manufacturing,",

General productivity measures including organizational restructuring, headcount reduction, real estate optimization and the expansion of our Global Business Services and automation initiatives. Refer to Treasury and Financing risk for financing costs management examples.\n\nFurthermore, Philips relies on pricing adjustments for its products and services and periodic indexation clauses in long term contracts to counteract costs increases as well as building capabilities to drive value extraction and handle inflation for the foreseeable future, for example through training of commercial teams.\n\n## Compliance risks 6.6\n\n## Philips is exposed to risks of non-compliance of its products and services with various regulations and standards, including quality, product safety and security\n\nOur reputation and license to operate depends on our compliance with global regulations and standards. In particular, Philips is exposed to the ongoing impact of the Respironics voluntary recall and related matters. Please refer to the section Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70 and the Note Contingencies, starting on page 204. Philips operates in a highly regulated health-technology product safety and quality environment and its products and services, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies, e.g., FDA (US), EMA (Europe), NMPA (China), MHRA (UK), ASNM (France), BfArM (Germany), and IGZ (the Netherlands). In the EU, the Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) became effective in May 2021 and imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements. Examples of other productrelated regulations are the EU's Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Energy-using Products (EuP) regulations. We are subject to various domestic, EU, US and foreign environmental laws and regulations, which are continuing to develop. Any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could jeopardize product quality, safety and security and/or expose us to lawsuits, administrative penalties and civil remedies, which may have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nPhilips has observed an increase in safety and security requirements in a variety of new and upcoming legislation dealing with market access of consumer goods, medical devices, information and communication technology products, (cloud) services, and specific areas such as data protection, AI, and supply chain. Both regulators and customers require us to demonstrate legal compliance and adequate security management using national and\n\ninternational standards and associated certifications. Non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, fines, disgorgements of profits, and/or claims for damages. Product safety incidents or user concerns could jeopardize patient safety and/or trigger inspections by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger the impacts described above, as well as other consequences. These issues could adversely impact Philips' financial condition or operating result through lost revenue and cost of any required remedial actions, penalties or claims for damages. They could also negatively impact Philips' reputation, brand, relationship with customers and market share.\n\nRisk response: Philips is committed to patient safety and delivering the highest-quality products, services and solutions compliant with all applicable laws and standards. Our Quality & Regulatory function closely monitors developments in the regulatory landscape. Through specialist teams at the global, regional or local level, detailed standards and requirements are defined and continuously improved as an integral part of our process standards and through dedicated programs when needed, with the aim of ensuring that our employees are aware of and able to comply with these requirements. In the event of compliance issues, we actively engage with the regulatory authorities with respect to compliance and remediation, where relevant. For example, in June 2021 our subsidiary, Respironics, initiated a voluntary recall notification for certain sleep and respiratory care products to address identified potential health risks, and the FDA conducted an inspection of a Respironics manufacturing facility in connection with the recall. Following the FDA's inspection and the subsequent inspectional observations, the US Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the FDA, began discussions with Philips in July 2022 regarding the terms of a consent decree to resolve the identified issues. We are publishing the latest updates on the Respironics field action on our corporate website www.philips.com.\n\nFor more information, refer to the sub-section Quality & Regulatory and patient safety, starting on page 70 in the Governance section of the ESG chapter in this report and the Notes Provisions, starting on page 193 and Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\n## Philips is exposed to the risks of non-compliance with business conduct rules and regulations, including privacy and upcoming ESG disclosure and due diligence requirements.\n\nIn the execution of its strategy, Philips could be exposed to the risk of non-compliance with business conduct rules and regulations and our General Business Principles, including, but not limited to, patient safety, quality, anti-bribery, healthcare compliance, privacy and data protection, as well as upcoming ESG disclosure requirements and due diligence requirements. This risk is heightened in growth geographies, as the legal and regulatory environment is less developed compared to mature geographies. Examples of compliance risk areas include commission payments to third parties and remuneration payments to",

The ongoing digitalization of Philips' products and services, including its processing of personal data, increases the importance of compliance with privacy, data protection and similar laws. These risks could adversely affect Philips' financial condition, reputation and brand and trigger the additional risk of exposure to governmental investigations, inquiries and legal proceedings and fines. In various jurisdictions, ESG disclosure requirements are currently being drafted. In Europe, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has been approved. European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) will be adopted in 2023 and will significantly increase the scope of mandatory ESG disclosures. Also, the proposed European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive will (if implemented) require companies to identify and act on adverse environmental and human rights impacts across their organization - and potentially their entire value chain. Failure to meet these requirements could trigger the additional risk of exposure to inquiries from supervisory bodies and adversely affect Philips' reputation and brand, or could adversely impact Philips' financial condition or operating result through lost revenue and cost of any required remedial actions, penalties or claims for damages.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the sub-section Legal proceedings within the Note Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\nRisk response: Over the years, we have extensively transformed the company and strengthened our business processes. As part of that, we have invested substantially in adherence to our General Business Principles (patient safety, quality and integrity always) through the deployment of compliance and awareness programs, as well as the establishment of policies and processes that reinforce adherence. With respect to privacy and data protection, Philips has established a privacy compliance framework, which includes policies, standards and procedures (such as the Binding Corporate Rules), with the aim of ensuring and demonstrating compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Philips has a strong track record on ESG disclosures, often ahead of legislation, and has been closely involved in the development of ESRS. The company already has reasonable assurance on all its ESG disclosures and has started a project to meet the increased requirements of ESRS.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the sub-section Philips General Business Principles in the section Our approach to risk management, starting on page 88.",

The company faced significant issues, including the consequences of the Philips Respironics recall, supply chain and inflationary pressures, the war in Ukraine and the COVID situation in China, which all contributed to the below-par business and financial performance. These developments had a significant impact on our shareholders and employees. In that context, we greatly appreciate the trust our customers show in us, as reflected in our order book.\n\nMindful of the seriousness of the situation, the Supervisory Board is fully committed to supporting management in leading the company out of its current difficulties and towards a future of progressive value creation with sustainable impact. As we explain in our Report, the Supervisory Board spent many sessions in 2022 engaging with the Board of Management and closely and actively reviewing key priority issues and actions to put Philips back on a value creation track for its stakeholders.\n\nIn the course of the year, our succession planning - during which we extensively evaluated internal and external candidates - resulted in the appointment of Roy Jakobs as CEO of Philips. The Board recognizes the portfolio transformation of Philips over the last decade into a focused, global solutions leader in health technology, which needs further performance improvement on several aspects. Our Board is convinced that Roy is the right CEO to take Philips to the next level of performance, by driving execution of the strategic plan and the firm measures announced in the October and January releases. Our Board focus is fully aligned with the company's priorities: driving quality, completing the recall, improving supply chain and business performance, and simplifying the organization. We continue to offer the leadership team our support wherever applicable.\n\nThe Supervisory Board knows that addressing the Philips Respironics recall and strengthening patient safety and quality is Philips' first priority. We feel encouraged by the most recent update around the recall, as the company strives to finalize remediation and testing. We fully understand the impact this issue has had on patients, clinicians, care givers, as well on regulators and investors. We are pleased to note that by year-end 2022, following the substantial ramp-up of capacity, Philips Respironics had completed around 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients. We are also\n\nencouraged by the complete set of test results for the first-generation DreamStation (DS1), which accounts for over two thirds of the sleep therapy devices subjected to the recall.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also discussed the supply chain situation frequently and in depth in 2022 - both the external situation and the improvements needed internally to improve business and financial performance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board supports the simplification of Philips' organizational structure, where the businesses are leading, supported by the regions and global functions, with more focused KPIs. The workforce reductions announced in October 2022 and January 2023 were difficult, yet necessary measures as the company as drives a major step-up in productivity, including focusing its R&D activities on fewer, yet more impactful projects. Philips will strive to implement these reductions with due respect for every employee affected and in line with all local rules and regulations.\n\n## Changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held in May 2022, the Supervisory Board was strengthened by the addition of Herna Verhagen and Sanjay Poonen as new members. With her proven track record in driving a customer-first company culture and a background in e-commerce logistics, Herna Verhagen has brought valued and new perspectives to the Supervisory Board, while Sanjay Poonen's extensive experience in enterprise IT and cloudenabled business models has further strengthened the Supervisory Board's digital competencies. I also wish to thank Neelam Dhawan, who stepped down at the end of the 2022 AGM, for her long-term counsel and support.\n\nTogether with my fellow Supervisory Board members, I look forward to providing further oversight of Philips as the company addresses the key priorities for its recovery and at the same time continues to deliver on its purpose of improving people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation.\n\n## Feike Sijbesma\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

As members of the Supervisory Board, we act in the interests of Royal Philips, its businesses and all its stakeholders. This report includes a more specific description of the Supervisory Board's activities during the financial year 2022 and other relevant information on its functioning.\n\n## 2022 focus areas and activities of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn 2022, Philips' performance continued to be impacted by the Philips Respironics voluntary recall and operational and supply challenges, such a shortage of electronic components, longer shipping timelines, and disruptions at suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also affected Philips' manufacturing sites in China. The company also faced other headwinds, such as inflationary pressure and the Russia-Ukraine war. These headwinds negatively impacted the conversion of the company's strong order book into sales and the 2022 margin. Furthermore, performance continued to be negatively impacted by the consequences of the Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business in June 2021.\n\nAgainst this background, the Supervisory Board was regularly updated by management on the company's performance and outlook, and the Supervisory Board engaged in discussions with management on improving performance, among others by addressing the patient safety and accelerating our focus on quality, resilience and quality of the supply chain operations and simplifying the ways of working at Philips to improve performance and increase productivity and agility. Near term and longer-term actions to strengthen the supply chain resilience, as proposed by management, were reviewed by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn this context, the Supervisory Board and management also discussed the external environment in which the company operates, and the impact that the macro-economic outlook has on its performance.\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board devoted considerable time to the Philips Respironics voluntary recall, as a recurring agenda item for each of its (regular) meetings. The Supervisory Board discussed and tracked the progress made with the repair and replacement program, as well as the comprehensive test and research approach for the CPAP, BiPAP and mechanical ventilator devices affected. Putting the interest of patients first, the Supervisory Board asked management to keep patients regularly updated on the status of the repair or replacement of their devices and to accelerate the repair and replacement program where possible, despite operational and supply challenges. The Supervisory Board was also regularly updated on other aspects of the recall, such as the ongoing engagements with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other competent authorities globally,\n\ndiscussions with the US Department of Justice (DOJ), acting on behalf of the FDA regarding the consent decree, as well as the criminal and civil investigation opened by the DOJ's Consumer Protection Branch and Civil Fraud Section, and the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to which Philips Respironics is subject and the ongoing classaction lawsuits and individual personal injury claims in which Philips Respironics is a defendant.\n\nRecognizing the importance of patient safety and quality of products and solutions sold by the Philips Group generally, significant time was spent in 2022 on reviewing and tracking progress of the company-wide program launched in 2021 ('Accelerating Patient Safety and Quality') to improve and foster a culture, behaviors and a mindset that puts quality and patient safety first. In the context of this program, the Supervisory Board also discussed the process framework for product design and production controls in the company.\n\nThe Supervisory Board carefully considered the CEO succession planning and ran an extensive selection and evaluation process, supported by an external executive search firm, during which various scenarios were considered to ensure the best outcome. Following the completion of this process in which both internal and external candidates were considered and evaluated, the Supervisory Board unanimously concluded that Mr Roy Jakobs was the best candidate. The Supervisory Board subsequently nominated Mr Jakobs as the new CEO/ President of the company effective October 15, 2022, to allow for him to take full ownership of the 2023 budget and business plan. The Supervisory Board is very pleased that Philips' shareholders appointed Mr Jakobs at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (with 99.77% of our shareholders voting favor) held on September 30, 2022. Since the appointment of Mr Jakobs, the Supervisory Board has been working closely with him on his key priorities to further improve and strengthen Philips' performance as a leading health technology company, which priorities include: (i) further deepening the patient safety and quality capability across the company, which includes the completion of the Philips Respironics voluntary recall; (ii) leading the Philips Group to resume its profitable growth trajectory by addressing current headwinds, including strengthening the supply chain resilience as noted above; and (iii) simplification of the organization to improve performance and productivity.\n\nFollowing Mr Jakobs' appointment, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management interacted on the company's overall strategy to extend its leadership as a health technology company and its plan to create value with sustainable impact towards 2025 and beyond, based on focused organic growth and scalable innovation with improved execution as the key value driver, as presented on January 30, 2023. This plan is designed to restore sales growth and improvement of profitability, including the strategic plans and priorities of each of the segments Diagnosis & Treatment, Connected Care and Personal Health. These interactions led to the company's ambition and productivity initiatives, restructuring and other actions designed to improve its supply operations and performance, as well as its plans",

Furthermore, the number of key performance indicators that is used to track the company's performance will be significantly reduced. In this context, the Supervisory Board is also pleased with the strengthening of the Executive Committee with the appointments of Steve C. de Baca and Jeff DiLullo as members of the Executive Committee, in their roles as Chief Patient Safety & Quality Officer and Chief Market Leader of Philips North America respectively. This includes the immediate reduction of around 4,000 roles globally across the organization announced on October 24, 2022 and the further reduction of the company's workforce by around 6,000 roles globally by 2025 announced on January 30, 2023.\n\nThe overview below indicates other key matters that were reviewed and/or discussed during one or more meetings in the course of 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation, including the dividend policy and pay-out and the M&A framework, and specifically the company's flexibility under its capital structure and credit ratings to pay dividends and to fund capital investments, including share repurchases and other corporate finance initiatives.\n- \u00b7 The company's liquidity position and leverage, including the measures taken to strengthen it in light of the financial underperformance of the company.

Moreover, the Supervisory Board members collectively and individually interacted with members of the Board of Management, with members of the Executive Committee and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the CEO met regularly for bilateral discussions about the company's progress on a variety of matters. Herna Verhagen and Sanjay Poonen were appointed to the Supervisory Board with effect from May 10, 2022. They followed an induction program and interacted with the members of the Board of Management and various Executive Committee members for deep dives on strategy, finance and investor relations, governance and legal affairs.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings were well attended in 2022. All Supervisory Board members were present during the Supervisory Board meetings in 2022. The committees of the Supervisory Board also convened regularly (see the separate reports of the committees below) and the committees reported back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In addition to the formal meetings of the Board and its committees, the Board and Committee members held private meetings. The members of the Supervisory Board concluded that they devoted sufficient time to engage (proactively if the circumstances so required) in their supervisory responsibilities.\n\nIn May 2022, some Supervisory Board members visited Philips' Personal Health site in Drachten, the Netherlands and some Supervisory Board members participated in an innovation tour at the Philips site at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. In the course of 2022, various Supervisory Board members visited Philips' Diagnosis & Treatment manufacturing site in Best, the Netherlands, including a visit to the Customer Experience Center. Furthermore, in June 2022, the Supervisory Board visited the headquarters of Philips North America in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, where the North American Research &\n\nDevelopment Center of the company is based and met with several key members of the North American management team.\n\n## Supervisory Board: composition, diversity and self-evaluation\n\nThe Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body that is independent of the Board of Management and the company. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. The Supervisory Board considers all its members to be independent under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Furthermore, the members of its Audit Committee are independent under the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Supervisory Board currently consists of 10 members. In 2022, there were a number of changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board, all effective as per (the end of) the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Herna Verhagen and Sanjay Poonen were each appointed to the Supervisory Board for a term of four years. Paul Stoffels and Marc Harrison were each re-appointed for a term of four years. The term of appointment of Neelam Dhawan expired.\n\nThe Supervisory Board attaches great value to diversity in its composition and has adopted a Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee. For more information on the Diversity Policy, please refer to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 115. The Supervisory Board spent time in 2022 considering its composition, as well as the composition of the Executive Committee (including the Board of Management), taking into account the criteria set forth in the Diversity Policy.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board furthermore follows its profile (which was updated in early 2023), as included in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board. The profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among the members of the Supervisory Board, encompassing general management, international business, environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability, (consumer) health and medical technology, quality and regulatory, finance and accounting, human resources, manufacturing and supply chain, information technology and digital, marketing, and governmental and public affairs, all in relation to the global character of Philips' businesses. The Supervisory Board also aims for having members with different nationalities and (cultural) backgrounds, working experiences or otherwise diverse qualities, as well as one or more members with an executive or similar position in business or society no more than five years ago. The composition of the Supervisory Board shall furthermore be in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code best practice provisions on independence, and each member of the Supervisory Board shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the",

The size of the Supervisory Board may vary as it considers appropriate to support its profile.\n\nEffective 2022, (re-)appointments of members of the Supervisory Board must meet the gender quota, in accordance with Dutch law, requiring that at least one-third of the supervisory board members are women and at least one-third are men. (For calculation purposes, a total number of board members that cannot be divided by three, must be rounded up to the next number that can be divided by three.) Currently, the statutory quota is met, as out of ten Supervisory Board members, four members are female and six members are male.\n\nIn 2022, each member of the Supervisory Board completed a questionnaire to verify compliance with the applicable corporate governance rules and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board. The outcome of this survey was satisfactory.\n\nAn independent external party facilitated the 2022 self-evaluation process for the Supervisory Board and its committees. This included drafting and submitting relevant questionnaires, interviewing members of the Supervisory Board and aggregating and reporting on the results. The members of the Board of Management also provided their input. The questionnaires covered topics such as the composition, size, skills and experience, geographical coverage and diversity of the Supervisory Board, stakeholder oversight, strategic oversight, the management, dynamics and focus of the meetings of the Supervisory Board, the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board's oversight of various aspects of the company's business, risk management, succession planning and people oversight, the CEO succession process, the engagement with management and recommendations to improve the Supervisory Board's functioning and ways of working going forward. Furthermore, the performance of the Chairman, the other Supervisory Board members individually, and of the Supervisory Board's committees was evaluated separately.\n\nThe reports on the results of the evaluation were discussed in a meeting of the Supervisory Board. The results of the evaluation indicated that the Supervisory Board continues to be a well-functioning team, as also demonstrated during the expedited CEO succession process in 2022. The results demonstrated that the Supervisory Board is of appropriate size and benefits from different expertise, diversity, and international geographical representation. Suggestions were made to further strengthen the functioning of the Supervisory Board and its Committees going forward. The Supervisory Board stresses the importance of going deep in some important matters, in which the Committees play a key role too. This is in full alignment with the current focus of management on patient safety and quality, supply chain reliability and performance and simplification of the organization, with the aim to enhance organic growth and people and patient centric innovation. Early 2023, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also discussed the results of the self-evaluation with each of the individual\n\nmembers of the Supervisory Board; the Chairman also discussed the evaluation of his own functioning with the Vice -Chairman.\n\nKey topics that the Supervisory Board and its Committees will focus on in 2023 include tracking progress on certain aspects of the Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification (including but not limited to the repair and replace program and the testing program), the internal Accelerating Patient Safety and Quality program launched in 2021, with respect to improving the resilience of the supply chain and the company's performance and cash flow generation. Furthermore, in 2023, the Supervisory Board will focus on the company's liquidity position and financial headroom and prepare updates to the remuneration policies for the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management that will be submitted to the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, and track the progress made with the simplification of the company's operating model with the aim of reducing complexity and clarifying accountabilities and tracking the reduction of roles as announced by the company on October 24, 2022 and January 30, 2023 respectively.\n\nThe periodic use of an external facilitator to measure the functioning of the Supervisory Board will continue to be considered in the future.",

Its other members are Paul Stoffels and Indra Nooyi. The Committee is responsible for the review of selection criteria and appointment procedures for the Board of Management, the Executive Committee, certain other key management positions, as well as the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn 2022, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee held nine meetings and all Committee members attended these meetings, with the exception of one member unable to attend the meeting in August 2022. Furthermore, the Committee had numerous additional special meetings in 2022, in particular on the topic of the CEO succession process, which were attended by all Committee members.\n\nThe Committee devoted time to the appointment or reappointment of candidates to fill current and future vacancies on the Supervisory Board. Following those consultations, it prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board on candidates for appointment. This resulted in the appointment of Herna Verhagen and Sanjay Poonen as members of the Supervisory Board at the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nUnder its responsibility for the selection criteria and appointment procedures for Philips' senior management, the Committee reviewed the functioning of the Board of Management and its individual members, the Executive Committee succession plans and emergency candidates for key roles in the company. The conclusions from these reviews were taken into account in the performance evaluation of the Board of Management and Executive Committee members and the selection of succession candidates. Reference is made to 2022 Annual Incentive, setting out the performance review of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee members by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee devoted ample time to the selection and appointment of the new CEO/President of the company as discussed above in the report of the Supervisory Board. This resulted in the appointment of Mr Roy Jakobs as President/CEO and member of the Board of Management at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on September 30, 2022. Furthermore, the Committee devoted time in 2022 to the selection and/or appointment of candidates to fill other current and future vacancies on the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. This resulted in: the appointment of Willem Appelo as a member of the Executive Committee in his role as Chief Operations Officer (succeeding Sophie Bechu who stepped down from the Executive Committee), effective September 2022; the appointment of Steve C. de Baca as a member of the Executive Committee in his role as Chief Patient Safety & Quality Officer, effective February 6, 2023; and the appointment of Jeff DiLullo as a member of the Executive Committee in his role as Chief Market Leader of Philips North America (succeeding Vitor Rocha who left the\n\ncompany), also effective February 6, 2023. As announced on December 8, 2022, Kees Wesdorp left the company on January 1, 2023, with Bert van Meurs (Chief Business Leader for the Image Guided Therapy businesses) temporarily expanding his role to include the leadership of the Precision Diagnosis businesses.\n\nWith respect to corporate governance matters, the Committee discussed relevant developments and legislative changes, including the revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the regulatory regimes around disclosure requirements related to ESG. Finally, the Committee reviewed the Charter of the Corporate Governance and Nomination and Selection Committee and concluded it remains appropriate.\n\nWith respect to the productivity initiatives and other actions to improve the company's performance (including the unfortunate but necessary reduction of roles), the Committee was updated by management on the impact on employees and the phased deployment approach and reviewed the simplification of the organization.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee was adopted in 2017 and revised in early 2023, and is published on the company website. The Committee periodically assesses the Diversity Policy and the size and composition of the Supervisory Board and makes recommendations, if relevant, relating to the profile for the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe criteria in the Diversity Policy aim to ensure that the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the Executive Committee have a sufficient diversity of views and the expertise needed for a good understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities related to the company's business. The nature and complexity of the company's business is taken into account when assessing optimal diversity, as well as the social and environmental context in which the company operates.\n\nPursuant to the Diversity Policy, the selection of candidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee is based on merit. With due regard to the criteria set forth in the Diversity Policy, the company shall seek to fill vacancies by considering candidates that represent a diversity of (among others) ages, gender, identities and educational and professional backgrounds. Please refer to the Supervisory Board report, starting on page 107 for more information on the diversity of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Diversity Policy includes the Supervisory Board's aim that the Board of Management and the Executive Committee comprise members with different nationalities and (cultural) backgrounds, working experiences or otherwise diverse qualities. Effective 2022, Dutch law requires listed companies to set appropriate and ambitious gender diversity targets for the",

We have taken this negative advisory vote very seriously and that is why we reached out to the company's shareholders immediately after the 2022 AGM, and further engaged with our shareholders in the second half of 2022. I, as the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, together with Investor Relations, held discussions with thirteen of our larger shareholders (in aggregate representing approximately 45% of the issued share capital) and with three of the most representative institutional advisory organizations.\n\n## Feedback received from our shareholders\n\nMost of our shareholders understand that under certain circumstances the Supervisory Board should be able to adjust the Annual Incentive (AI) and Long-Term Incentive (LTI) payouts, but they did express their specific concern regarding the adjustments made for the members of the Board of Management over 2021 also in view of the impact the year had on our shareholders. Our shareholders, however, did understand the discretionary adjustments made for the wider employee workforce, particularly to address retention risks. performance realization, especially given the above-target realization over 2021 for the CEO. Finally, they requested us to be transparent about the way the 2021 adjustments would be\n\nFurthermore, they requested us to be more transparent in the way we disclose our individual reflected in the company performance targets set for the 2022 AI.\n\n## How have we addressed this feedback\n\nNaturally the AI and LTI pay-out was impacted by the low company performance. As explained in our 2021 Remuneration Report and during our engagements ahead of the 2022 AGM we have applied the adjustments in the best interest of the company and employees\n\nto address retention risks in view of the challenging circumstances our people had and still have to work in. However, in discussions with our shareholders after the 2022 AGM, we concluded that in making adjustments for the members of the Board of Management, a stronger alignment with the interest of our shareholders should be applied. Therefore, the Supervisory Board reconsidered the company's long standing practice, and decided to no longer automatically apply a uniform AI and LTI adjustment methodology for the entire company and effectively de-couple the remuneration approaches for the members of the Board of Management and for the broader workforce.\n\nWe still have the opinion that it is good to have a strong alignment in remuneration between members of the Board of Management and our broader workforce, but we realize that in certain circumstances addressing the retention risks of our own people can result in a disalignment between the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the interest of the shareholders. Therefore we have adjusted our approach.\n\nA decision we have taken - already prior to the 2022 AGM - to increase clarity on potential adjustments and reward for performance, is to set targets going forward, starting with the 2022 AI based on our adjusted EBITA *) metric reported externally and as such apply a welldefined and disclosed set of adjustments (please refer to Reconciliation of non-IFRS information, starting on page 246 for an exact definition of the performance metric).\n\nIn the context of our company's performance in 2022 and to align with the shareholder experience, the Supervisory Board and Board of Management have jointly concluded that it was appropriate to waive any 2022 AI pay-out and any vesting of the 2020 LTI grant of the current members of the Board of Management. Specifically, this means that an amount of EUR 236,957 of the AI and an amount of EUR 188,994 of the LTI was waived.\n\nFor transparency purposes, we provided an enhanced disclosure of the individual performance realization. While there would have been a payout based on the individual performance realization, there was no AI payout for the financial performance criteria because the realized performance is below the respective thresholds. For the avoidance of doubt we confirm that the financial targets that were set for 2022 took into account the adjustments made in relation to the 2021 remuneration in a way that the members of the Board of Management would not benefit twice from these adjustments.\n\nOther feedback received during these (and future) shareholder engagements, including but not limited to enhanced disclosures, pay-out principles and thresholds and, an evaluation of our claw back conditions, will also be taken into account when preparing for a renewal of our shareholders' mandate on our remuneration policies (to be voted on during our 2024 AGM). As I have mentioned in my letter last year, it is our purpose at Philips to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation. As a Remuneration Committee we want to assure that our remuneration policy supports this purpose.",

The annual base compensation of Mr Jakobs was set at EUR 1,200,000, below the base salary of his predecessor, and in line with Philips' remuneration policy, but just below the median of our Quantum Peer Group. Upon his appointment, Mr Jakobs received performance shares with a grant value of EUR 314,137, which equals his 2022 CEO LTI grant value pro-rated for the time in role in 2022. The 2022 LTI grant that Mr Jakobs received as part of the remuneration, in his previous role, was likewise pro-rated for the time in role and until he took over the role as CEO. Our 2022 Remuneration Report also includes a description of the remuneration (to be) received by the former CEO after his succession under his services agreement terminating on April 30, 2023. All payments are in line with contractual obligations.\n\n## The composition of the Remuneration Committee and its activities\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is chaired by Paul Stoffels. Its other members are David Pyott, Herna Verhagen and Feike Sijbesma. The Committee is responsible for preparing decisions of the Supervisory Board on the remuneration of individual members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee, as well as the policies governing this remuneration. In performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert. For a full overview of the responsibilities of the Committee, please refer to the Charter of the Remuneration Committee, as set forth in Chapter 3 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board (which are published on the company's website). Our annual Remuneration Committee cycle enables us to have an effective decision-making process supporting the determination, review and implementation of the Remuneration Policy. The Committee met seven times in 2022. All Committee members were present during these meetings.\n\nI look forward to presenting this Remuneration report at our annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee,\n\n## Paul Stoffels\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Remuneration report 2022 8.2.2\n\nIn this Remuneration Report, the Supervisory Board provides a comprehensive overview, in accordance with article 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code, of the remuneration paid and owed to the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board respectively in the financial year 2022. The report will also be published as a stand-alone document on the company's website after the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the agenda of which will include an advisory vote on this Remuneration Report.\n\n## Board of Management\n\n## Summary of 2020 Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Remuneration Policy and Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Board of Management have been adopted and approved respectively by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 2020, which took place on April 30, 2020.\n\nThe objectives of the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management are: to focus them on delivering on our purpose and strategy, to motivate and retain them, and to create stakeholder value.\n\nThus, the Remuneration Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Supports improving the company's overall performance and enhancing the long-term value of the company;\n- \u00b7\n- Directly supports our purpose by: a) linking a part of remuneration to achieving our strategic imperatives through the criteria and targets included in the Annual and Long-Term Incentives; b) offering market competitive compensation compared to a peer group of business competitors and companies we compete with for executive talent; c) enabling us to motivate, retain and attract world-class talent in order to support our purpose of improving people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation and our goal of addressing our customers' healthcare challenges (delivering on the Quadruple Aim); d) stimulating share ownership to create alignment with shareholders and encourage\n- employees to act as stewards and ambassadors of the company;\n- \u00b7 Encourages the company and its employees to act responsibly and sustainably;\n- \u00b7 Delivers value for our stakeholders, such as shareholders, customers, consumers and employees, by continuously engaging with them and make a positive contribution to society at large;\n- \u00b7 Leads to fair and internally consistent pay levels by taking into account internal pay ratios.",

Given that a substantial number of relevant competitors are US-headquartered, the weighting of US-based healthcare companies is more notable than for the Quantum Peer Group.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## TSR Performance Peer Group 2022\n\n| US companies      | European companies     | Japanese companies   |\n|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Becton Dickinson  | Alcon                  | Canon                |\n| Boston Scientific | Elekta                 | Terumo               |\n| Cerner            | Fresenius Medical Care |                      |\n| Danaher           | Getinge                |                      |\n| General Electric  | Siemens Healthineers   |                      |\n| Hologic           | Smith & Nephew         |                      |\n| Johnson & Johnson | Reckitt Benckiser      |                      |\n| Medtronic         |                        |                      |\n| Resmed            |                        |                      |\n| Stryker           |                        |                      |\n\nThe Remuneration Policy and the LTI Plan allow changes to the peer groups to be made by the Supervisory Board without further approval from the General Meeting of Shareholders in respect of up to three companies on an annual basis (for instance: following a delisting of a company or, a merger of two peer companies), or six companies in total during the four years following adoption and approval of the Remuneration Policy and the LTI Plan respectively (or, if earlier, until the adoption or approval of a revised Remuneration Policy or revised LTI Plan). Since the adoption of the current Remuneration Policy in 2020, the divestment of the Domestic Appliances business in 2021 led to the decision of the Supervisory Board to remove Electrolux, Essity and Henkel from the Quantum Performance Peer Group and replace them with Alcon, GlaxoSmithKline and Stryker. No changes were made to the TSR Peer Group during 2022. However, as Cerner has been delisted after its acquisition by Oracle in 2022, the Supervisory Board has selected Baxter to replace Cerner for the 2023 LTI grant. In addition, following the initial public offering of GE Healthcare, GE Healthcare is included in the TSR Performance Peer Group for the 2023 LTI grant, replacing General Electric.\n\n## Services agreements\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are engaged by means of a services agreement ( overeenkomst van opdracht ). Termination of the contract by either party is subject to six months' notice period. The severance payment is set at a maximum of one year's annual base compensation. No severance payment is due if the agreement is terminated early on behalf of the Board of Management member or in the case of urgent cause ( dringende reden ) as defined in article 7:678 and further of the Dutch Civil Code. The term of the services agreement is aligned with the term for which the relevant member has been appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (which is a maximum period of four years, it being understood that this period expires no later than at the end of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) held in the fourth year after the year of appointment).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Contract terms for current members 2022\n\n|                      | end of term   |\n|----------------------|---------------|\n| Roy Jakobs           | AGM 2026      |\n| Abhijit Bhattacharya | AGM 2023      |\n| Marnix van Ginneken  | AGM 2025      |\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Management in 2022 8.2.3\n\nThe Supervisory Board has determined the 2022 pay-outs and awards to the members of the Board of Management, upon the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the 2020 Remuneration Policy and the 2020 LTI Plan.

This was done in accordance with the LTI Plan as approved during the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee annually conducts a scenario analysis. This includes the calculation of remuneration under different scenarios, whereby different Philips performance assumptions and corporate actions are examined. The Supervisory Board concluded that the relationship between the strategic objectives and the chosen performance criteria for the 2022 Annual Incentive, as well as for the 2020 LTI, were adequate.\n\nHowever, in the context of our company's performance in 2022 and to align with the shareholder experience, the Supervisory Board and Board of Management have jointly concluded that it was appropriate to waive any 2022 AI pay-out and any vesting of the 2020 LTI grant of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThis 2022 Remuneration Report also includes a description of the remuneration (to be) received by the former CEO of the company in respect of the period after October 15, 2022 (the date on which he was succeeded by Mr Jakobs) pursuant to and in line with the terms of his services agreement that was concluded and published on the company's website and presented to the AGM in view of his appointment in 2019 and which will terminate on April 30, 2023 (reference is made to 'Remuneration former CEO'). Accordingly, the former CEO will receive a partial 2022 AI pay-out and partial vesting of the 2020 LTI grant.\n\n## Annual Base Compensation\n\nThe annual base compensation of Roy Jakobs as new CEO was set at EUR 1,200,000 (below the base salary of his predecessor of EUR 1,325,000), in line with Philips' remuneration policy, following market practice and considering the complexity of the role. The annual base compensation of the other members of the Board of Management has been reviewed as part of the regular remuneration review. As a result, the annual base compensation of Abhijit Bhattacharya and Marnix van Ginneken has been increased per April 1, 2022, from EUR 795,000 to EUR 810,000 and EUR 615,000 to EUR 630,000, respectively. This increase was made to move the total compensation level closer to the market median level, as well as to reflect internal relativities.\n\n## 2022 Annual Incentive\n\nThe Annual Incentive performance has been assessed based on company financial results as well as individual results. Details are as follows:\n\n## Company financial results (80% weighting)\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy, the company sets financial targets in advance of the year for all members of the Board of Management. For the year 2022, the financial targets set at Group level cover Comparable Sales Growth *) , Adjusted EBITA *) and Free Cash Flow *) . The realized performance regrettably did not reach the threshold performance target on any of these three criteria.\n\n|                                | Weighting as % of       |                       |                    | Assessment of performance maximum performance   |                      |                                 | Weighted pay-out as %      |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Financial performance criteria | target Annual Incentive | threshold performance | target performance |                                                 | realized performance | resulting payout as % of target | of target Annual Incentive |\n| Comparable Sales Growth 1)     | 30%                     | 1.8%                  | 4.8%               | 6.8%                                            | (2.8)%               | 0.0%                            | 0%                         |\n| Adjusted EBITA 1)              | 30%                     | 9.7%                  | 12.7%              | 14.7%                                           | 7.4%                 | 0.0%                            | 0%                         |\n| Free Cash Flow 1)              | 20%                     | 400                   | 700                | 1,000                                           | (961)                | 0.0%                            | 0%                         |\n| Total                          | 80%                     |                       |                    |                                                 |                      |                                 | 0%                         |\n\n## Individual targets based on area of responsibility (20% weighting)\n\nIn the context of our company's performance in 2022 and to align with the shareholder experience, the members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management jointly concluded that it was appropriate to waive any 2022 AI pay-out of the current members of the Board of Management, despite a positive realization on their individual performance criteria. Specifically, this means that aggregately an amount of EUR 236,957 (including an amount of EUR 35,881 related to the AI for Roy Jakobs in his role as Chief Business Leader Connected Care for the period January 1, 2022 up and until October 14, 2022) was waived.\n\nFor the sake of transparency, the individual performance criteria and assessment targets set at the beginning of the year, have been disclosed in the table below. To determine the payout levels for the individual goals, the Supervisory Board typically applies a holistic assessment as to the performance against the set goals as well as the relative weighting of the goal categories. These relative weightings are not in all cases equal, but such that any goal category remains relevant and aligned with the strategic priorities for the year.",

The realization of this grant is based on TSR achievement, adjusted EPS growth and sustainability objectives.\n\nIn the context of our company's performance in 2022 and to align with the shareholder experience, the Supervisory Board and Board of Management jointly concluded that it was appropriate to waive any vesting of the 2020 LTI grant of the current members of the Board of Management, despite a positive performance achievement of the sustainability objectives. Specifically, this means that an amount of EUR 188,994 was waived.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Performance achievement and vesting levels\n\n|                           | achievement   | weighting   | vesting level   | adjusted vesting level (waived)   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| TSR                       | 0%            | 50%         | 0%              | 0%                                |\n| EPS                       | 0%            | 40%         | 0%              | 0%                                |\n| Sustainability objectives | 180%          | 10%         | 18%             | 0%                                |\n| Total                     |               |             | 18%             | 0%                                |\n\n## TSR (50% weighting)\n\nA ranking approach to TSR applies with Philips itself included in the TSR Performance Peer Group.

This resulted in Philips being positioned at rank 20 in the TSR performance peer group shown in the following table, resulting in a TSR achievement of 0%.\n\nFollowing Oracle's acquisition of Cerner (completed June 2022), the Supervisory Board adopted the approach of recognizing Cerner's performance through the delisting date. As a proxy for future performance, reinvestment in an index of the remaining 19 peer companies was assumed (effectively retaining a peer group of 20 companies).\n\n## TSR results LTI Plan 2020 grant: (63.66%)\n\n|                      | total return   |   rank number |\n|----------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Danaher              | 85.47%         |             1 |\n| Hitachi              | 74.64%         |             2 |\n| ResMed               | 56.08%         |             3 |\n| Getinge              | 44.14%         |             4 |\n| Hologic              | 43.04%         |             5 |\n| Johnson & Johnson    | 37.70%         |             6 |\n| Siemens Healthineers | 24.07%         |             7 |\n| De Longhi            | 15.22%         |             8 |\n| Terumo               | 14.05%         |             9 |\n| Stryker              | 13.15%         |            10 |\n| Cerner               | 7.70%          |            11 |\n| Boston Scientific    | 3.48%          |            12 |\n| Becton Dickinson     | (1.36)%        |            13 |\n| General Electric     | (3.63)%        |            14 |\n| Medtronic            | (20.68)%       |            15 |\n| Smith & Nephew       | (35.25)%       |            16 |\n| Groupe SEB           | (39.46)%       |            17 |\n| Elekta               | (48.80)%       |            18 |\n| Fresenius Medical    | (51.91)%       |            19 |\n| Philips              | (63.66)%       |            20 |\n\n## Adjusted EPS growth (40% weighting)\n\nThe LTI Plan EPS payouts and targets set at the beginning of the performance period were as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## LTI Plan EPS payouts\n\n|                     | Below threshold   | Threshold   | Target   | Maximum   | Actual   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| LTI plan EPS (euro) | <1.28             | 1.28        | 1.50     | 1.71      | (1.43)   |\n| Payout              | 0%                | 40%         | 100%     | 200%      | 0%       |\n\nIn respect of the 2020 LTI grant, the LTI plan EPS is calculated based on a reported net income attributable to shareholders divided by the number of common shares outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) on the day prior to the beginning of the performance period (to eliminate the impact of any share buyback, stock dividend, etc.), resulting in an EPS of EUR (1.82). Furthermore, as per the 2020 LTI Plan, the LTI Plan EPS includes adjustments to account for events that were not planned when targets were set or were outside management's control such as the profit and loss impact of acquisitions and divestitures (positive adjustment), the profit and loss impact of portfolio restructuring (positive impact), the profit and loss impact of legal charges (positive impact) and impact of foreign exchange variations versus plan (positive adjustment). Overall, this resulted in an LTI Plan EPS of EUR (1.43) based on adjusted net income from continuing operations, leading to a realization of 0% of target.\n\n## Sustainability objectives (10% weighting)\n\nIn order to further align the remuneration package for the Board of Management with our purpose and our ESG commitment, a sustainability criterion was introduced in the 2020 LTI Plan. Philips believes that ESG performance will improve the company's performance as a whole and, therefore, that it should be explicitly linked to (long-term) remuneration. The criteria are based on three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as defined by the United Nations that are included in Philips' strategy on sustainability (no. 3, 12 and 13). These three SDGs are translated in five underlying objectives, which are measured against a specific target range.\n\nAt the beginning of the performance period, challenging target ranges are set for each of the five objectives. Based on a point-to-point method, performance achievement is measured at the end of the performance period (i.e. 3 years) versus the beginning of the performance period. The pay-out is determined based on the following scheme:",

As five out of five objectives are achieved within or above target zone, the payout % lies between 150% and 200% of target. Based on the overall performance of the five objectives, the Supervisory Board has assessed that a vesting level of 180% would reflect an appropriate positioning within the target range. However, as explained above, any vesting of the 2020 LTI grant of the Board of Management was waived, including vesting relating to the achieved sustainability objectives. While the strong performance on the sustainability objectives is therefore not resulting in any vesting for the current members of the Board of Management, it is celebrated by the company as it contributes to our purpose and our ESG commitment.\n\nFor more information on the realized performance on all five objectives please refer to our Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 45 and Assurance report of the independent auditor, starting on page 296.\n\n| Sustainability category                                                               | Underlying objective                                | Target range           | realized performance   | realized performance   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (SDG3) Lives Improved | Targeted # of Lives Improved in year 3 1)           | 1,467 - 1,667 million  | 1,810 million          | Above target zone      |\n| Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG12) Circularity            | Targeted circular revenue in year 3 2)              | 12.2% - 16.2%          | 18.1%                  | Above target zone      |\n| Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG12) Circularity            | Targeted waste to landfill in year 3 3)             | 4.7% - 0.1%            | <0.1%                  | Within target zone     |\n| Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG12) Circularity            | Targeted closing the loop in year 3 4)              | 14.5 - 23.0%           | 35.2%                  | Above target zone      |\n| Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG13) Carbon footprint  | Targeted CO 2 equivalent (in Kilo Tonnes) in year 3 | 661 - 589 KTonnes CO 2 | 438 Ktonnes CO 2       | Above target zone      |\n\n## 2023 Long-Term Incentive\n\nThe vesting of the 2023 Long-Term Incentive grant consisting of performance shares is subject to performance over a period of 3 years and based on two financial criteria and one non-financial criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 50% weighting: Relative Total Shareholder Return ('TSR')\n- \u00b7 40% weighting: Adjusted Earnings per Share growth *) ('EPS')\n- \u00b7 10% weighting: Sustainability objectives\n\nPlease refer to the Long-Term Incentive Plan published on the company's website for more information.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe following pension arrangement is in place for the members of the Board of Management working under a services agreement governed by Dutch law:\n\n- \u00b7 Flex ES Pension Plan in the Netherlands, which is a Collective Defined Contribution plan with a fixed contribution of (currently) 30.3% (including an own contribution of 2%) of the maximum pensionable salary of EUR 114,866 (effective January 1, 2022) minus the offset.

Costs related to performance shares are based on accounting standards (IFRS), which prescribe that costs for each LTI grant are recognized over the full (multi-year) vesting period, proportionate to the relevant fiscal year. Therefore, the costs for any year reflect costs of multiple LTI grants, as opposed to the actual value for the holder of an LTI grant at the vesting date.

Until this time, the former CEO obviously remains available for advisory services. The termination of the agreement with the former CEO is fully in line with the applicable conditions as laid down in the services agreement agreed in 2019.\n\nUp to the termination date of April 30, 2023, the former CEO will be receiving the base compensation, pension arrangement and other allowances following from the termination of his 2019 services agreement. For the period October 15, 2022 up and until December 31, 2022, the base compensation, pension expenditures and other compensation represent a value of EUR 283,151, EUR 126,695 and EUR 11,774 respectively. The partial 2022 AI pay-out and partial vesting of the 2020 LTI grant will be paid out, respectively vest, pursuant to contractual obligations in this regard. Therefore, the former CEO received an AI payment of EUR 265,000 for the year 2022 and his 2020 LTI grant vested at 18% of target in line with the 2020 LTI plan realization.\n\nFor the year 2023, the base compensation, pension expenditures and other compensation represent a value of EUR 435,616, EUR 194,986 and EUR 18,087 (expected) respectively. In respect of the remainder of his services agreement during 2023, the former CEO will be eligible for a prorated AI payment based on the actual 2023 financial performance and his individual performance at target according to the contractual obligations. At target this prorated AI represents a value of EUR 435,616. The former CEO will not receive an LTI grant for the year 2023. In accordance with the relevant provisions of his services agreement, the former CEO will receive a severance payment equal to one-year annual base compensation (amounting to EUR 1,325,000).\n\nThe former CEO's LTI grants with a vesting date after April 30, 2023 (granted in 2021 and 2022) will continue to vest at their regular vesting dates (April 30, 2024, and April 29, 2025 respectively) subject to the predetermined performance conditions. The termination of the services agreement with the former CEO did not trigger a tax expense for the company based on Article 32bb of the Dutch Wage Tax Act.\n\n## 5-year development of CEO and BoM versus average employee remuneration costs compared to company performance\n\nInternal pay ratios are a relevant input factor for determining the appropriateness of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy, as recognized in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. For the 2022 financial year, the ratio between the annual total\n\ncompensation for the CEO and the average annual total compensation for an employee was 55:1. The ratio decreased from 63:1 in 2021. Further details on the development of these amounts and ratios over time can be found in the following table. The average employee remuneration costs and company financial performance have been adjusted retroactively such that the Domestic Appliances business is excluded from the figures. Please note that the amounts presented in the following table reflect total remuneration costs to the company which differ from the actual payout to the members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Remuneration cost in EUR\n\n|                                              | 2018      | 2019      | 2020      | 2021      | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Remuneration                                 |           |           |           |           |           |\n| CEO Total Remuneration Costs (A) 1)          | 5,391,265 | 5,260,111 | 6,153,067 | 5,452,299 | 5,133,659 |\n| CFO Total Remuneration Costs                 | 2,595,688 | 2,602,606 | 3,007,990 | 2,652,864 | 1,896,081 |\n| CLO Total Remuneration Costs                 | 1,861,200 | 1,856,426 | 2,203,160 | 2,029,054 | 1,416,837 |\n| Average Employee (FTE) Total Remuneration 2) | 89,843    | 92,645    | 91,455    | 86,853    | 93,373    |\n| Costs (B)                                    |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Ratio A versus B 3)                          | 60:1      | 57:1      | 67:1      | 63:1      | 55:1      |\n| Company performance                          |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Annual TSR 4)                                | 1.2%      | 25.6%     | 6.2%      | (14.5)%   | (60.0)%   |\n| Comparable Sales Growth% 5)                  | 4.9%      | 4.5%      | 2.9%      | (1.2)%    | (2.8)%    |\n| Adjusted EBITA% 5)                           | 13.3%     | 13.2%     | 13.2%     | 12.0%     | 7.4%      |\n| Free Cash Flow 5)                            | 990       | 923       | 1,635     | 900       | (961)     |\n\n## Historical LTI grants and holdings\n\n## Number of performance shares (holdings)\n\nUnder the LTI Plan the current members of the Board of Management were granted 153,891 performance shares in 2022.

The table below shows the minimum shareholding requirement, annual base compensation, (vested) shares held and share ownership ratio of each Board of Management member as per December 31, 2022. Until the minimum shareholding requirement is reached, the members of the Board of Management are required to retain all after-tax performance shares that have vested, but they are not required to make additional share purchases.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Share ownership Board of Management\n\n|                   | Minimum shareholding requirement 1)   | Annual Base Compensation   | (Vested) shares held   | Ownership ratio 2)   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| R.

The fee levels in this Remuneration Policy are the same as the Supervisory Board fee levels as determined by our shareholders at the 2018 Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe overarching objective of the 2020 Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board is to enable its members to fulfill their duties, acting independently: supervising the policies, management and the general affairs of Philips, and supporting the Board of Management and the Executive Committee with advice. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the company's long-term interests, with due observance of the company's purpose and strategy, taking into account the interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\nTo support the objectives mentioned above, the 2020 Remuneration Policy is aimed at attracting and retaining international Supervisory Board members of the highest caliber and with experience and expertise relevant to our health technology businesses.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the 2020 Remuneration Policy provides that the remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board is not dependent on the results of the company and does not include any shares (or rights to shares). Nevertheless, members of the Supervisory Board are encouraged to hold shares in the company for the purpose of long-term investment to reflect their confidence in the future course of the company. The company does not grant personal loans to members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews fee levels in principle every three years in order to monitor and take account of market developments and manage expectations of our key stakeholders. The levels are aimed at broadly median market levels (and around the 25th percentile market level for the Chairman) paid in the Quantum Peer Group (as used in the 2020 Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management).\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the current remuneration structure:\n\n## Remuneration Supervisory Board in EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                                           | Chair                  | Vice Chair             | Member                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Supervisory Board                                         | 155,000                | 115,000                | 100,000                |\n| Audit Committee                                           | 27,000                 | n.a.                   | 18,000                 |\n| Remuneration Committee                                    | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000                 |\n| Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000                 |\n| Quality & Regulatory Committee                            | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000                 |\n| Attendance fee per inter-European trip                    | 2,500                  | 2,500                  | 2,500                  |\n| Attendance fee per intercontinental trip                  | 5,000                  | 5,000                  | 5,000                  |\n| Entitlement to Philips product arrangement                | 2,000                  | 2,000                  | 2,000                  |\n| Annual fixed net expense allowance                        | 11,345                 | 2,269                  | 2,269                  |\n| Other travel expenses                                     | As reasonably incurred | As reasonably incurred | As reasonably incurred |\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board benefit from coverage under the company's Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance.",

Its other members are Peter L\u00f6scher, Chua Sock Koong and Sanjay Poonen (who joined in the course of 2022). Feike Sijbesma also regularly attends Audit Committee meetings. The Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its supervisory responsibilities, including ensuring the integrity of the company's financial statements, reviewing the company's internal controls and overseeing the enterprise risk management process.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee held five regular meetings and two extraordinary meetings, which all Audit Committee members attended.\n\nThe CEO, CFO, Chief ESG & Legal Officer, Head of Internal Audit, Chief Accounting Officer and external auditor (Ernst & Young Accountants LLP) were invited to and attended all regular meetings.\n\nThe Committee, together with the Chief ESG & Legal Officer, also met separately in private sessions with the CEO, CFO, Head of Internal Audit and external auditor after every regular quarterly meeting of the Committee. Prior to the Committee meetings, the Audit Committee chair met one-on-one with the Group Treasurer as well as with each of the\n\nmanagement who regularly attend the Audit Committee meetings (as set out in the previous paragraph) and with the external auditor (Ernst & Young Accountants LLP).\n\nThe following overview highlights matters that were reviewed and/or discussed during Committee meetings in the course of, or in respect of, the financial year 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 The company's 2022 annual and interim financial statements and non-financial information, prior to publication. This review included the increase of EUR 165 million in the field action provision recorded in Q1 2022 in connection with the Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification related to the sound abatement foam in certain sleep and respiratory care products (announced on June 14, 2021), to cater for the higher expected volume of devices eligible for remediation, higher communication costs and potential higher cost of execution and to ensure the speed of the program in a volatile environment. The Committee also reviewed the increase of EUR 85 million in such provision recorded in Q4 2022, resulting from the increased proportion of new replacement devices in order to expedite the completion of the Philips Respironics voluntary recall. In each of the regular quarterly meetings of the Committee, the Committee reviewed the draft of the press release on the company's annual or interim financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Matters relating to accounting policies, financial risks, reporting and compliance with accounting standards. Key accounting judgments were discussed in-depth, and treatments were challenged, as were quality of earnings. Compliance with statutory and legal requirements and regulations, particularly in the financial domain, was also reviewed. Important findings, Philips' top and emerging areas of risk (including the internal auditor's reporting thereon, and the Chief ESG & Legal Officer's review of litigation and other claims, as well as material investigations), and follow-up actions and appropriate measures were examined thoroughly.\n- \u00b7 The company's cash flow generation, liquidity and financing headroom, and its ability under its capital structure and credit ratings to pay dividends and to fund capital investments, including share repurchases and other corporate finance initiatives. The Committee also monitored ongoing goodwill impairment indicators, in particular in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business, which resulted in a EUR 1.3 billion non-cash charge in Q3 2022 for the impairment of goodwill of this business. The non-cash charge of EUR 168 million that was recorded in Q3 2022 in connection with the initiative to enhance the productivity in Research & Development (among others, by discontinuing certain Research & Development projects) has also been reviewed by the Committee. Furthermore, the Committee reviewed the goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter, risk management, legal compliance, and developments in regulatory investigations, as well as legal proceedings, including antitrust investigations and related provisions.\n- \u00b7 The quarterly Internal Audit reports in which the Head of Internal Audit highlighted key findings of internal audits and fraud investigations by the Internal Audit Function in the",

The Committee discussed the adequacy of the remediation actions agreed with management and accountabilities for executing on these actions. In each meeting the Head of Internal Audit also presented the audit schedule for the upcoming quarter.\n\n- \u00b7 Specific finance topics, share repurchases, and in particular the settlement of forward contracts entered into as part of the share repurchase program announced on July 26, 2021, (at the original settlement dates in 2023 and 2024, instead of in 2022 as earlier announced), capital spending and the company's debt financing strategy (including the EUR 1 billion credit facility the company entered into as announced on October 24, 2022).\n- \u00b7 A post-investment review of projects in the areas of Information Technology, Research & Development, Real Estate, Operations and Restructuring, and assessment of the actual spend and timing of such projects against the original budget and timing.\n- \u00b7 Review and approval of the revised Internal Audit charter, annual audit plan and budget, audit scope, and its coverage in relation to the scope of the external audit, as well as the staffing, independence, performance and organizational structure of the Internal Audit Function.\n- \u00b7 The performance of the external auditor in conducting the group and statutory audits as required by the Auditor Policy and the results of the 2021 EY service quality review program for Philips. Taking into account this performance review, the Committee evaluated the proposal for re-appointment of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP. Subsequently, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP was re-appointed at the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders as external auditor for a term of one year, starting on January 1, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Later in the year, the Committee also evaluated the auditor tender process which resulted in the Committee's recommendation to the Supervisory Board to submit to the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders proposals to re-appoint Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as the company's external auditor for a term of one year, starting on January 1, 2024 and to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. as the company's new external auditor, starting on January 1, 2025 for a term of four years.\n- \u00b7 The proposed 2022 external audit scope, including key audit areas, approach and fees, and non-audit services provided by the external auditor in conformity with the Philips Auditor Policy.\n- \u00b7 Review and challenge of the independence as well as the professional fitness and good standing of the external auditor and its engagement partners. For information on the fees of the Group auditor, please refer to Audit fees in the note Income from operations, starting on page 162.\n- \u00b7 The company's policy on business controls, legal compliance and the General Business Principles (including deployment). The Committee reviewed, discussed and monitored closely the company's internal control certification processes, and in particular, compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and its requirements regarding assessment, review and monitoring of internal controls. The Committee also reviewed the status of previously reported significant deficiencies and progress made\n\nwith respect to the remediation thereof. It also discussed on a regular basis the developments in, and findings relating to, conduct resulting from investigations into alleged violations of the General Business Principles and, if required, any measures taken.\n\n- \u00b7 The company's structure and system on export controls and sanctions for compliance with the international sanctions and export controls.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee received a report from the company's Head of Tax, updating the Committee on several tax aspects, including the company's effective tax rate, tax transparency and tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIn February 2023, the Committee reviewed, together with the other members of the Supervisory Board, the key audit matters and the critical audit matters identified by the auditor in relation to the 2022 financial statements included in the Annual Report 2022 and the Annual Report on Form 20-F respectively as well as the draft of the Annual Report 2022. In February 2023, the Committee also reviewed the draft of the company's 2022 Country Activity and Tax Report.\n\nDuring each regular quarterly Audit Committee meeting, the Committee reviewed the quarterly report from the external auditor, in which the auditor set forth its findings and attention points during the relevant period. Apart from the Audit Committee meetings, the external auditor also attended all private sessions with the Audit Committee, where their observations were, if necessary, further discussed. The Annual Audit Letter was circulated to the full Supervisory Board, and planned actions to address the items raised were discussed with management in the subsequent Audit Committee meetings as well as in private sessions with management.\n\nFinally, the Committee reviewed the Audit Committee Charter and concluded it remains appropriate.",

(Royal Philips), a company organized under Dutch law, is the parent company of the Philips group. Its shares have been listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange (Euronext Amsterdam) since 1912. Furthermore, its shares have been traded in the United States since 1962 and have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1987.\n\nRoyal Philips has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board, each of which is accountable to the General Meeting of Shareholders for the fulfillment of its respective duties.\n\nThe company is governed by Dutch corporate and securities laws, its Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and of the Supervisory Board respectively. Its corporate governance framework is also based on the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (dated December 8, 2016) and US laws and regulations applicable to Foreign Private Issuers. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented the Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and underlying policies, as well as separate codes of ethics that apply to employees working in specific areas of our business, i.e., the Financial Code of Ethics and the Procurement Code of Ethics.

When deemed necessary in the interests of the company, the company may deviate from aspects of the company's corporate governance structure, and any such deviations will be disclosed in the company's corporate governance report.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, other parts of the management report (within the meaning of article 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code) included in the Annual Report address the strategy and culture of Philips aimed at long-term value creation. Philips' strategy is driven by our purpose to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation, as described in more detail in Strategy and Businesses, starting on page 9. The Message from the CEO, starting on page 5 explains how the company's strategy was executed in 2022; in this regard, please refer also to Financial performance, starting on page 26. Furthermore, reference is made to the Philips Business System, an interdependent,\n\ncollaborative operating model that covers all aspects of how we operate - strategy, governance, processes, people, culture and performance management.

Finally, refer to Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 45 for more information on our approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably and our overall societal impact.\n\n## Board of Management and Executive Committee 9.2\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. Certain key officers have been appointed to support the Board of Management in the fulfilment of its managerial duties. The members of the Board of Management and these key officers together constitute the Executive Committee. In this Corporate governance report, wherever the Executive Committee is mentioned, this also includes the members of the Board of Management, unless the context requires otherwise. Please refer to Board of Management and Executive Committee, starting on page 7 for an overview of the current members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee.\n\nUnder the chairmanship of the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and supported by the other members of the Executive Committee, the members of the Board of Management drive the company's management agenda and share responsibility for the continuity of the Philips group, focusing on long-term value creation. Please refer to the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee, which are published on the company's website, for a description of further responsibilities and tasks, as well as procedures for meetings, resolutions and minutes.\n\nIn fulfilling their duties, the members of the Board of Management and Executive Committee shall be guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprise, taking into account the interests of its stakeholders. The Board of Management and the Executive Committee have adopted a division of responsibilities based on the functional and business areas, each of which is monitored and reviewed by the individual members.

Members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee will be present in the meetings of the Supervisory Board if so invited. In addition, the CEO and other members of the Board of Management (and if needed, the other members of the Executive Committee) meet on a regular basis with the Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management and the Executive Committee are required to keep the Supervisory Board informed of all facts and developments concerning Philips that the Supervisory Board may need to be aware of in order to function as required and to properly carry out its duties.\n\nCertain important decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval, including decisions concerning: the operational and financial objectives of the company and the strategy designed to achieve these objectives; the issue, repurchase or cancellation of shares; and major acquisitions or divestments.\n\n## Appointment and composition\n\nMembers of the Board of Management, including the CEO, are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders upon a binding recommendation drawn up by the Supervisory Board after consultation with the CEO. This binding recommendation may be overruled by a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and representing at least one-third of the issued share capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor of the resolution to overrule the binding recommendation, but such majority does not represent at least one-third of the issued share capital, a new meeting may be convened, at which the resolution may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, regardless of the portion of the issued share capital represented by such majority. In the event that a binding recommendation has been overruled, a new binding recommendation shall be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders. If such second binding recommendation has been overruled, the General Meeting of Shareholders shall be free to appoint a board member.\n\nThe CEO and the other members of the Board of Management are appointed for a term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the closing of the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held in the fourth calendar year after the year of their appointment or, if applicable, at a later retirement date or other contractual termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting of Shareholders resolves otherwise. The same applies in the case of re-appointment, which is possible for consecutive terms of four years. A (re-)appointment schedule for the Board of Management is published on the company's website.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the members of the Board of Management are engaged by means of a services agreement ( overeenkomst van opdracht ). The term of the services agreement is aligned with the term for which the relevant member has been appointed by the General\n\nMeeting of Shareholders. In case of termination of the services agreement by the company, severance payment is limited to a maximum of one year's base salary. The services agreements provide no additional termination benefits.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and by the General Meeting of Shareholders, and members of the Board of Management may be dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (in each case in accordance with the Articles of Association). The other members of the Executive Committee are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the CEO, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board 9.3\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises the policies, management and general affairs of Philips, and assists the Board of Management and the Executive Committee with advice on general policies related to the activities of the company. In fulfilling their duties, the members of the Supervisory Board shall be guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprise, taking into account the interests of its stakeholders.\n\nIn the two-tier corporate structure under Dutch law, the Supervisory Board is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management and the company. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. The Supervisory Board considers all its members to be independent under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Furthermore, the members of its Audit Committee are independent under the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Supervisory Board must approve certain important decisions of the Board of Management, including decisions concerning the operational, business and financial objectives of the company and the strategy designed to achieve these objectives, the issue, repurchase or cancellation of shares and major acquisitions or divestments. The Supervisory Board and its individual members each have a responsibility to request from the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and the external auditor all information that the Supervisory Board needs in order to be able to carry out its duties properly as a supervisory body.\n\nPlease refer to the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which are published on the company's website, for a description of further responsibilities and tasks, as well as procedures for meetings, resolutions and minutes.",

Please refer to Supervisory Board report, starting on page 107. Please also refer to Supervisory Board, starting on page 105 for an overview of the current members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Appointment and composition\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders upon a binding recommendation drawn up by the Supervisory Board. This binding recommendation may be overruled by a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and representing at least one-third of the issued share capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor of the resolution to overrule the binding recommendation, but such majority does not represent at least onethird of the issued share capital, a new meeting may be convened. At this new meeting the resolution may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, regardless of the portion of the issued share capital represented by such majority. In the event that a binding recommendation has been overruled, a new binding recommendation shall be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders. If such second binding recommendation has been overruled, the General Meeting of Shareholders shall be free to appoint a board member.\n\nThe term of appointment of members of the Supervisory Board expires at the closing of the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held after a period of four years following their appointment. There is no age limit requiring the retirement of board members.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, members of the Supervisory Board are eligible for re-appointment for a fixed term of four years once, and may subsequently be reappointed for a period of two years, which appointment may be extended by at most two years. The report of the Supervisory Board must state the reasons for any re-appointment beyond an eight-year period.\n\nA (re-)appointment schedule for the Supervisory Board is published on the company's website.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may be suspended or dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board are selected taking into account the company's Diversity Policy, which is published on the company's website. The Supervisory Board's composition furthermore follows the profile included in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, and the size of the board may vary as it considers appropriate to\n\n## support its profile. Please refer to Supervisory Board report, starting on page 107 by the Supervisory Board, starting on page 105.\n\nEffective 2022, Dutch law provides a mandatory gender quota, requiring that least one-third of the Supervisory Board members are women and at least one-third men (for calculation purposes, a total number of board members that cannot be divided by three, must be rounded up to the next number that can be divided by three). The quota is applicable to (i) the appointment of new Supervisory Board members, and (ii) the re-appointment of acting board members after eight years following their initial appointment. Except in certain exceptional circumstances, any appointment or re-appointment resulting in a Supervisory Board composition which does not meet (or no longer meets) the quota, will be invalid (null and void).\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board, while retaining overall responsibility, has assigned certain tasks to four committees: the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Quality & Regulatory Committee. Each committee reports to the full Supervisory Board. Please refer to the charters of the respective committees, which are published on the company's website as part of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, for a description of their responsibilities, composition, meetings and working procedures.\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee is responsible for preparing selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The Committee makes proposals to the Supervisory Board for the (re)appointment of such members, and periodically assesses their functioning. The Committee also periodically assesses the Executive Committee succession planning, and the Diversity Policy, and supervises the policy of the Executive Committee on the selection criteria and appointment procedures for Philips executives. At least once a year, the Committee reviews the corporate governance principles applicable to the company, and advises the Supervisory Board on any changes to these principles that it deems appropriate.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing decisions of the Supervisory Board on the remuneration of individual members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The Committee prepares an annual remuneration report, which is published on the company's website by the Supervisory Board ahead of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. In performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert.",

It reviews the company's annual and interim financial statements, including non-financial information, prior to publication and advises the Supervisory Board on the adequacy and appropriateness of internal control policies and internal audit programs and their findings. The Committee furthermore supervises the internal audit function, maintains contact with and supervises the external auditor and prepares the nomination of the external auditor for appointment by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe composition of the Audit Committee meets the relevant requirements under Dutch law and the applicable US rules. All of the members are considered to be independent and financially literate, and the Audit Committee as a whole has the competence relevant to the sector in which the company is operating. In addition, Liz Doherty is designated as an Audit Committee financial expert, as defined under the regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Supervisory Board considers the expertise and experience available in the Audit Committee, in conjunction with the possibility to take advice from internal and external experts and advisors, to be sufficient for the fulfillment of the tasks and responsibilities of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Quality & Regulatory Committee has been established by the Supervisory Board in view of the central importance of the quality and (patient) safety of the company's products, systems, services and software as well as the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing thereof, and the regulatory requirements relating thereto. The Quality & Regulatory Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in this area, whilst recognizing that the Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in its oversight of other areas of regulatory, compliance and legal matters.\n\n## Other Board-related matters 9.4\n\n## Remuneration and share ownership\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board, taking into account the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board is determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders, also on the basis of a remuneration policy.\n\nThe current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, respectively, were adopted in 2020 and are published on the company's website. Pursuant to Dutch law, the shareholders are entitled to vote on the adoption of the separate remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (at least) every four years. The adoption of a remuneration policy will require a special majority of three-quarters of the votes cast (as the Articles of Association do not provide for a lower majority).\n\nA description of the composition of the remuneration paid and owed to the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is included in the annual remuneration report (as prepared by the Remuneration Committee, adopted by the Supervisory Board and published on the company's website). Shareholders have an advisory vote at each Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on the remuneration report relating to the preceding financial year.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board is authorized to reduce or eliminate unpaid bonuses awarded to members of the Board of Management if payment or delivery of the bonus would be unacceptable according to the principles of reasonableness and fairness. The company, which in this respect may also be represented by the Supervisory Board or a special representative appointed for this purpose by the General Meeting of Shareholders, may also request return of bonuses already paid or delivered insofar as these have been granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the relevant performance criteria or other conditions. Bonuses are broadly defined as 'non-fixed' (variable) remuneration - either in cash or in the form of share-based compensation - that is conditional in whole or in part on the achievement of certain targets or the occurrence of certain circumstances. The explanatory notes to the balance sheet shall report on any moderation and/or claim for repayment of Board of Management remuneration. No such reduction of unpaid bonuses or requests for repayment occurred during the financial year 2022.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the company does not grant personal loans to and guarantees on behalf of members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board. No such loans were granted and no such guarantees were issued in 2022, nor were any loans or guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAlso in compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Articles of Association provide that shares or rights to shares shall not be granted to members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may only hold shares in the company for the purpose of long-term investment and must refrain from short-term transactions in Philips securities. According to Philips' internal rules of conduct with respect",

Furthermore, members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are prohibited from trading, directly or indirectly, in securities of any of the companies belonging to Philips' peer group (as determined by the Supervisory Board) during one week preceding the disclosure of Philips' annual or quarterly results.\n\nTransactions in Philips shares carried out by members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are reported to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation and, if necessary, to other relevant authorities.\n\n## Indemnification\n\nUnless Dutch law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as the reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an act or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ( opzettelijk ), intentionally reckless ( bewust roekeloos ) or seriously culpable ( ernstig verwijtbaar ), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement unless the law or the principles of reasonableness and fairness require otherwise. The company has also taken out liability insurance (D&O - Directors & Officers) for the persons concerned.\n\n## Diversity\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the Executive Committee are selected taking into account the company's Diversity Policy, which is published on the company's website. Effective 2022, Dutch law provides that (re)appointments of members of the Supervisory Board must be in accordance with a mandatory gender quota, requiring that at least one-third of the supervisory board members are women (and at least one-third are men). There are certain exceptions where the gender quota does not apply, such as the re-appointments within eight years of the initial appointment and (re-)appointments made in exceptional circumstances.\n\nFor more details on the Diversity Policy and board diversity, please refer to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 115. For more details on the Diversity Policy, the profile of the Supervisory Board and board diversity please refer to Supervisory Board report, starting on page 107, to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 115 and to Inclusion & Diversity, starting on page 65.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDutch law on conflicts of interest provides that a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board may not participate in the adoption of resolutions if he or she has a direct or indirect personal conflict of interest with the company or related enterprise. If all members of the Board of Management have a conflict of interest, the resolution concerned will be considered by the Supervisory Board. If all members of the Supervisory Board have a conflict of interest, the resolution concerned must be considered by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the company's corporate governance includes rules to specify situations in which a potential or actual conflict may exist, procedures to avoid such conflicts of interest as much as possible, and procedures to deal with such conflicts should they arise. Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interest, if any, must be mentioned in the Annual Report (specifically the management report) for the financial year in question. No decisions to enter into material transactions in which there are conflicts of interest with members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board were taken during the financial year 2022.\n\n## Outside directorships\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, members of the Board of Management require the approval of the Supervisory Board before they can accept a position as a member of a supervisory board or a position as a non-executive director on a one-tier board (Non-Executive Directorship) at another company. The Supervisory Board must be notified of other important positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of Management.\n\nDutch law provides for certain limitations on the number of Non-Executive Directorships a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board may hold. No member of the Board of Management shall hold more than two Non-Executive Directorships at 'large' companies ( naamloze vennootschappen or besloten vennootschappen ) or 'large' foundations ( stichtingen ), as defined under Dutch law, and no member of the Board of Management shall hold the position of chairman of another one-tier board or the position of chairman of another supervisory board. No member of the Supervisory Board shall hold more than five Non-Executive Directorships at such companies or foundations, with a position as chairman counting for two. During the financial year 2022 all members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board complied with the limitations described above in this paragraph.",

The agenda for the meeting typically includes: an advisory vote on the remuneration report; discussion of the Annual Report; the adoption of the financial statements; policy on additions to reserves and dividends; any proposed dividends or other distributions; discharge of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board; any other matters proposed by the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management or shareholders in accordance with Dutch law and the Articles of Association.\n\nShareholders' meetings are convened by public notice via the company's website, and registered shareholders are notified by letter or by electronic means of communication at least 42 days prior to the day of the relevant meeting. Shareholders who wish to exercise the rights attached to their shares in respect of a shareholders' meeting are required to register for such meeting. Shareholders may attend a meeting in person, vote by proxy (via an independent third party) or grant a power of attorney to a third party to attend the meeting and vote on their behalf. Details on registration for meetings, attendance and proxy voting will be included in the notice convening the relevant meeting.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the record date for the exercise of voting rights and rights relating to shareholders' meetings is set at the 28th day prior to the day of the relevant meeting. Shareholders registered on such date are entitled to attend the meeting and to exercise the other shareholder rights (at the relevant meeting) notwithstanding any subsequent sale of their shares after the record date.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association and Dutch law, requests from shareholders for items to be included on the agenda will generally be honored, subject to the company's rights to refuse to include the requested agenda item under Dutch law, provided that such requests are made in writing at least 60 days before a General Meeting of Shareholders to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board by shareholders representing at least 1% of the company's outstanding capital or, according to the official price list of Euronext Amsterdam, representing a value of at least EUR 50 million. Written requests may be submitted electronically and shall comply with the procedure stipulated by the Board of Management, which procedure is posted on the company's website.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, shareholders requesting an item to be included on the agenda of a meeting have an obligation to disclose their full economic interest (i.e., long position and short position) to the company. The company has the obligation to publish such disclosures on its website.\n\n## Main powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe main powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders are:\n\n- \u00b7 to appoint, suspend and dismiss members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 to adopt remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, to determine the remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board and to approve long-term incentive (equity-based) plans for the Board of Management;\n- \u00b7 to adopt the annual accounts, to declare dividends and to discharge the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board from any liability in respect of the performance of their respective duties for the previous financial year;\n- \u00b7 to appoint the company's external auditor;\n- \u00b7 to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association and proposals to dissolve or liquidate the company;\n- \u00b7 to issue shares or rights to shares;\n- \u00b7 to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights of shareholders and to repurchase or cancel outstanding shares; and\n- \u00b7 in accordance with Dutch law, to approve decisions of the Board of Management that are so far-reaching that they would greatly change the identity or nature of the company or the business.\n\nThe company applies principle 4.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code within the framework of the Articles of Association and Dutch law and in the manner described in this corporate governance report. All issued and outstanding shares carry voting rights and each share confers the right to cast one vote in a shareholders' meeting. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting of Shareholders in respect of shares which are held by the company. There are no special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on the voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law and/or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting of Shareholders are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast and do not require a quorum.\n\n## Share capital; issue and repurchase of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 800 million, divided into 2 billion common shares with a nominal value of 20 eurocents each and 2 billion preference shares also with a nominal value of 20 eurocents each. On December 31, 2022, the issued share capital amounted to EUR 177,863,016.40 divided into 889,315,082 common shares and no preference shares. All shares are fully paid-up. There are currently no limitations, either under Dutch law or the Articles of Association, to the transfer of the common shares.",

Only New York Registry Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Pursuant to article 10:138(2) of the Dutch Civil Code, the laws of the State of New York are applicable to the proprietary regime with respect to the New York Registry Shares, which proprietary regime includes the requirements for a transfer of, or the creation of an in rem right in, such New York Registry Shares. Euroclear shares and New York Registry Shares may be exchanged for each other.\n\nAs per December 31, 2022, approximately 89% of the common shares were held through the system of Euroclear Nederland (Euroclear shares) and approximately 11% of the common shares were represented by New York Registry Shares issued in the name of approximately 843 holders of record. The latter include Cede & Co. Cede & Co acts as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, which holds the shares (indirectly) for individual investors as beneficiaries. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is Philips' New York transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent. Since certain shares are held by brokers and other nominees, these numbers may not be representative of the actual number of United States beneficial holders or the number of New York Registry Shares beneficially held by US residents.\n\nAt the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it was resolved to authorize the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares or to grant rights to acquire shares in the company as well as to restrict or exclude the pre-emption right accruing to shareholders up to and including November 9, 2023. This authorization is limited to a maximum of 10% of the number of shares issued as of May 10, 2022.\n\nIn addition, at the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it was resolved to authorize the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to acquire shares in the company within the limits of the Articles of Association and within a certain price range up to and including November 9, 2023. The maximum number of shares the company may hold will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital as of May 10, 2022. The number of shares may be increased by 10% of the issued capital as of that same date in connection with the execution of share repurchase programs for capital reduction programs.\n\n## Risk management approach 9.6\n\nRisk management and control forms an integral part of the Philips business planning and performance review cycle. The company's risk management policy and framework are designed to provide reasonable assurance that its strategic and operational objectives are met, that legal requirements are complied with, and that the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures is safeguarded. Please refer to Risk management, starting on page 87 for a more detailed description of Philips' approach to risk management (including Internal Control over Financial Reporting), risk categories and factors, and certain specific risks that have been identified.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting, a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with Internal Control over Financial Reporting. On the basis of the outcome of this process, the Board of Management confirms that: (i) the management report (within the meaning of section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code) provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; (ii) such systems provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies; (iii) based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis; and (iv) the management report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expected continuity of the company for a period of 12 months after the preparation of the report. The financial statements fairly represent the financial condition and result of operations of the company and provide the required disclosures.\n\nIn view of the above, the Board of Management believes that it is in compliance with best practice provision 1.4.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. It should be noted that the above does not imply that the internal risk management and control systems provide certainty as to the realization of operational and financial business objectives, nor can they prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud or non- compliances with rules and regulations. The above statement on internal control should not be construed as a statement in response to the requirements of section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statement as to compliance with section 404 is set forth in Management's report on internal control, starting on page 143.\n\n## Annual financial statements and external audit 9.7\n\nThe annual financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management and reviewed by the Supervisory Board upon the advice of its Audit Committee, taking into account the report of the external auditor. Upon approval by the Supervisory Board, the accounts are signed by all members of both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and are published together with the opinion of the external auditor. The Board of Management is responsible, under the supervision of the Supervisory Board, for the quality and completeness of such publicly disclosed financial reports. The annual financial statements are presented for discussion and adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to be convened subsequently.\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association. Philips' current external auditor, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, was appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 7, 2015, for a term of four years starting January 1, 2016, was re-appointed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 9, 2019 for a term of three years starting January 1, 2020 and was",

The external auditor may only provide audit and audit-related services and is prohibited from providing any other services. This is reflected in the Auditor Policy, which is published on the company's website. The policy is also in line with (and in some ways stricter than) applicable US rules, under which the appointed external auditor must be independent from the company both in fact and appearance.\n\nThe Auditor Policy specifies certain audit services and audit-related services (also known as assurance services) that will or may be provided by the external auditor, and includes rules for the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of such services. Audit services must be preapproved on the basis of the annual audit services engagement agreed with the external auditor. Proposed audit-related services may be pre-approved at the beginning of the year by the Audit Committee (annual pre-approval) or may be pre-approved during the year by the Audit Committee in respect of a particular engagement (specific pre-approval). The annual pre-approval is based on a detailed, itemized list of services to be provided, which is designed to ensure that there is no management discretion in determining whether a service has been approved, and to ensure that the Audit Committee is informed of each of the services it is pre-approving. Unless pre-approval with respect to a specific service has been given at the beginning of the year, each proposed service requires specific preapproval during the year. Any annually pre-approved services where the fee for the engagement is expected to exceed pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require specific pre-approval. The term of any annual pre-approval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval unless the Audit Committee states otherwise. During 2022, there were no services provided to the company by the external auditor which were not preapproved by the Audit Committee.\n\n## Stichting Preferente Aandelen Philips 9.8\n\nStichting Preferente Aandelen Philips, a Foundation ( stichting ) organized under Dutch law, has been granted the right to acquire preference shares in the capital of Royal Philips, as stated in the company's Articles of Association. In addition, the Foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of article 2:344 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe object of the Foundation is to represent the interests of Royal Philips, the enterprises maintained by the company and its affiliated companies within the company's group, in such a way that the interests of the company, these enterprises and all parties involved with them are safeguarded as effectively as possible, and that they are afforded maximum protection against influences which, in conflict with those interests, may undermine the\n\nautonomy and identity of Philips and those enterprises, and also to do anything related to the above ends or conducive to them. This object includes the protection of Philips against (an attempt at) an unsolicited takeover or other attempt to exert (de facto) control of the company. The arrangement will allow Philips to determine its position in relation to the relevant third party (or parties) and its (their) plans, to seek alternatives and to defend the company's interests and those of its stakeholders.\n\nThe mere notification that the Foundation exercises its right to acquire preference shares will result in such shares being effectively issued. The Foundation may exercise this right for as many preference shares as there are common shares in the company outstanding at that time. No preference shares have been issued as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe members of the self-electing Board of the Foundation are Messrs J.P. de Kreij, J.V. Timmermans, J. van der Veer and P.N. Wakkie. No Philips Supervisory Board or Board of Management members or Philips officers are represented on the board of the Foundation.\n\nOther than the arrangements made with the Foundation referred to above, the company does not have any measures which exclusively or almost exclusively have the purpose of defending against unsolicited public offers for shares in the capital of the company. It should be noted that the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board remain under all circumstances authorized to exercise all powers vested in them to promote the interests of Philips.\n\nThe company has issued certain corporate bonds, the provisions of which contain a 'Change of Control Triggering Event' or a 'Change of Control Put Event'. Upon the occurrence of such events, the company might be required to offer to redeem or purchase any outstanding bonds at certain pre-determined prices. Please also refer to Debt, starting on page 191.\n\n## Investor Relations 9.9\n\nPhilips is continuously focused on maintaining strong and open relations with its shareholders. In addition to communication with its shareholders at shareholders' meetings, the company may discuss its financial results during conference calls, which are broadly accessible. The company also publishes annual, semi-annual and quarterly reports and press releases, and informs investors via its website.\n\nFrom time to time the company communicates with investors and analysts via roadshows, broker conferences and a Capital Markets Day, which are announced in advance on the company's website. The purpose of these engagements is to further inform the market of the results, strategy and decisions made, as well as to receive feedback from shareholders. It is the company's policy to post presentations to investors and analysts on its website. Philips applies the best practice provision 4.2.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which it",

These communications take place either at the initiative of the company or at the initiative of investors/analysts. The company is generally represented by its Investor Relations department during these interactions, however, on a limited number of occasions the Investor Relations department is accompanied by one or more members of the senior management. The subject matter of the bilateral communications ranges from individual queries from investors/analysts to more elaborate discussions following disclosures that the company has made, such as its annual and quarterly reports. Philips complies with applicable rules and regulations on fair and non-selective disclosure and equal treatment of shareholders.\n\n## Major shareholders 9.10\n\nThe Dutch Act on Financial Supervision imposes an obligation on persons holding certain interests to disclose ( inter alia ) percentage holdings in the capital and/or voting rights in the company when such holdings reach, exceed or fall below 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 95 percent (as a result of an acquisition or disposal by a person, or as a result of a change in the company's total number of voting rights or capital issued). Certain derivatives (settled in kind or in cash) are also taken into account when calculating the capital interest. The statutory obligation to disclose capital interest relates not only to gross long positions, but also to gross short positions. Required disclosures must be made to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) without delay. The AFM then notifies the company of such disclosures and includes them in a register, which is published on the AFM's website. Furthermore, an obligation to disclose (net) short positions is set out in the EU Regulation on Short Selling.\n\nThe AFM register shows the following notifications of substantial holdings and/or voting rights at or above the 3% threshold: BlackRock, Inc.: substantial holding of 5.75% and 7.45% of the voting rights (May 13, 2022); T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.: substantial holding of 4.98% and 4.96% of the voting rights (February 2, 2023); Artisan Investments GP LLC: substantial holding of 5.13% and 5.13% of the voting rights (May 5, 2022).\n\n## Corporate information 9.11\n\nThe company began as a limited partnership with the name Philips & Co in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 1891, and was converted into the company with limited liability N.V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken on September 11, 1912. The company's name was changed to Philips Electronics N.V. on May 6, 1994, to Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. on April 1, 1998, and to Koninklijke Philips N.V. on May 15, 2013.\n\nThe majority of the shares in Royal Philips are held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Philips has also issued (physical) bearer share certificates ('Share Certificates'). A limited number of Share Certificates have not been surrendered yet, although the holders of Share Certificates are still entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Royal Philips. It is noted that, as a result of Dutch legislation that became effective per July 2019, the relevant shares were registered in the name of Royal Philips by operation of law per January 1, 2021. Owners of Share Certificates will continue to be entitled to a corresponding number of shares, but may not exercise the rights attached to such shares until they surrender their Share Certificates. Owners of Share Certificates may come forward to do so and to receive a corresponding number of shares until January 1, 2026, at the latest. As per January 2, 2026, entitlements attached to the Share Certificates not surrendered, will expire by operation of law. For more information, please contact the Investor Relations department by email (investor.relations@philips.com) or telephone (+31-20-59 77222).\n\nThe statutory seat of the company is Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and the statutory list of all subsidiaries and affiliated companies, prepared in accordance with the relevant legal requirements (Dutch Civil Code, Book 2, articles 379 and 414), forms part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is deposited at the office of the Commercial Register in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (file no. 17001910).

(Royal Philips) is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (f) under the US Securities Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\u037e providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements\u037e providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization\u037e and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Board of Management conducted an assessment of Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting based on the 'Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)' established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nBased on the Board of Management's assessment of the effectiveness of Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, it has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, Royal Philips' internal control over Group financial reporting is considered effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as included in this section Group financial statements, has been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows hereafter.\n\nBoard of Management Roy Jakobs Abhijit Bhattacharya Marnix van Ginneken\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting 10.1.1\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Report of the independent auditor 10.2\n\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting is set out in Management's report on internal control, starting on page 143.

In our opinion, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying section 'Management's report on internal control', of this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands February 21, 2023",

('Royal Philips'), incorporated and domiciled in the Netherlands, is a public limited liability company organized under Dutch Law. Philips is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and has its registered address at High Tech Campus 52, 5656 AG Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The consolidated financial statements of Royal Philips as of December 31, 2022 comprise Royal Philips and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'company' or 'Philips' or the 'Group'). Philips is a leading health technology company primarily involved in diagnostic imaging, image-guided therapy, patient monitoring and health informatics, as well as in consumer health and home care.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are:\n\n- \u00b7 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and comply with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;\n- \u00b7 authorized for issue by the Board of Management of Royal Philips on February 21, 2023;\n- \u00b7 prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated;\n- \u00b7 prepared on a going concern basis;\n- \u00b7 presented in euro, which is the presentation currency;\n- \u00b7 rounded to the nearest million euro unless stated otherwise;\n- \u00b7 subject to rounding, whereby amounts may not add up precisely to the totals provided.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and judgments that affect the application of accounting policies and the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Amounts recognized are based on factors that are by default associated with uncertainty. Actual results may therefore differ from estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to estimates are recognized prospectively. Where applicable, the estimates and judgments of specific financial statement items are described in the respective note to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe areas involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying accounting principles and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the consolidated financial statements are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of control (below paragraph Basis of consolidation and Interests in entities, starting on page 161)\n- \u00b7 Revenue recognition (Income from operations, starting on page 162)\n- \u00b7 For acquisitions, the identification and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including contingent considerations provisions (Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 158, Provisions, starting on page 193)\n- \u00b7 Determination of deferred tax assets for losses carried forward and uncertain tax positions (Income taxes, starting on page 168)\n- \u00b7 Assumptions used for impairment testing (Property, plant and equipment, starting on page 173, Goodwill, starting on page 176, Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 181)\n- \u00b7 Assessments of exposure to credit risk of financial instruments (Note Other financial assets, starting on page 184, Receivables, starting on page 186, Debt, starting on page 191, Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 214, Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 218)\n- \u00b7 Assumptions used to determine the net realizable value of inventories (Inventories, starting on page 186)\n- \u00b7 Actuarial assumptions of future events that are used in calculating post-employment benefit expenses and liabilities (Post-employment benefits, starting on page 198)\n- \u00b7 Estimating the likelihood of a potential outflow of resources, as well as the ability to make a reliable estimate of the obligation relating to provisions and contingent liabilities (Provisions, starting on page 193, Contingencies, starting on page 204)\n\nThe company regularly updates its significant assumptions and estimates to support the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In relation to areas of judgment and estimates as disclosed in the accounting policies, those which are primarily impacted by the macroeconomic environment include impairment testing, valuation of inventories, valuation of deferred tax balances, measurement of financial instruments and the determination of fair values (for example fair values of acquired identifiable intangible assets, contingent considerations and certain investments).\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements management has considered the impact of climate change, specifically the financial impact of Philips meeting its internal and external climate related aims, the potential impact of climate related risks and the costs incurred to pro-actively manage such risks. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or assumptions. The specific financial impacts considered include, for example: specific climate mitigation measures, such as the",

Accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items are included in the respective notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Koninklijke Philips N.V. and all subsidiaries that the company controls on a consolidated basis. Control exists when the company is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the company has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and in cases where Philips has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, Philips considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including the contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee, rights arising from other contractual arrangements and the company's voting rights and potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nThe financial statements of all group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The euro (EUR) is the functional currency of the company and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at transaction date or the valuation date in cases where items are remeasured. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and those resulting from the conversion of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income, except for qualifying cash flow hedges, qualifying net investment hedges and equity investments measured at fair value through OCI which are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nAll foreign exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, apart from tax items and financial income and expense, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign currency differences arising upon translation of foreign operations into euros are recognized in Other comprehensive income and presented as part of Currency translation differences in Equity. However, if the operation is not a wholly-owned subsidiary, the proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to Non-controlling interests.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the Currency translation differences related to the foreign operation is reclassified to the Consolidated statements of income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the company disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the respective proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to Non-controlling interests. When the company disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nPhilips operates in two economies that are considered hyperinflationary, Argentina and Turkey. The impact of the application of IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, is not material for the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## New accounting policies effective in 2022\n\nNo new IFRS accounting standards or amendments to existing standards, effective in 2022, had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. The company has not early adopted any standards or amendments to existing standards.\n\n## New accounting policies effective after 2022\n\nThe IASB has issued several IFRS accounting standards, or amendments to standards, with an effective date after 2022. The company does not anticipate that the application of these standards, or amendments to standards, will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.",

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation due to immaterial organizational changes.\n\n## Information by segment and main country 2\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSegment accounting policies are the same as the accounting policies applied by the company. Operating segments are components of the company's business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Executive Committee of the company). The Executive Committee decides how to allocate resources and assesses performance. Reportable segments comprise the operating segments Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Connected Care businesses and Personal Health businesses. Additionally, besides these reportable segments, segment Other contains the items Innovation & Strategy, IP Royalties, Central costs, and other small items.\n\nThe Philips operating segments are Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Connected Care businesses and Personal Health businesses, each being responsible for the management of its business worldwide. As of the first quarter of 2021 the Domestic Appliances business was presented as a discontinued operation and therefore no longer part of the Personal Health segment. The comparative results prior to that were restated to reflect the treatment of the Domestic Appliances business as a discontinued operation. Refer to Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 156.\n\nPhilips focuses on improving people's lives through meaningful innovation. The Diagnosis & Treatment segment unites the businesses related to the goal of precision diagnosis and disease pathway selection, and the businesses related to image-guided, minimally invasive treatment. The Connected Care segment focuses on patient care solutions, advanced informatics and analytics, and patient and workflow optimization inside and outside the hospital, and aims to unlock synergies from integrating and optimizing patient care pathways, and leveraging provider-payer-patient business models. The Personal Health segment focuses on healthy living and preventative care.\n\nThe Executive Committee of Philips is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for segment reporting purposes pursuant to IFRS 8 'Operating Segments'. The key segmental performance measure is Adjusted EBITA, which Management believes is the most relevant measure to evaluate the results of the segments.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Information on income statements in millions of EUR\n\n|                            | sales   | sales including intercompany   | depreciation and amortization 1)   | Adjusted EBITA   |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 2022                       |         |                                |                                    |                  |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment      | 9,168   | 9,471                          | (559)                              | 774              |\n| Connected Care             | 4,403   | 4,441                          | (514)                              | 95               |\n| Personal Health            | 3,626   | 3,684                          | (132)                              | 538              |\n| Other                      | 629     | 596                            | (397)                              | (89)             |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (366)                          |                                    |                  |\n| Philips Group              | 17,827  | 17,827                         | (1,602)                            | 1,318            |\n| 2021                       |         |                                |                                    |                  |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment      | 8,635   | 8,846                          | (459)                              | 1,071            |\n| Connected Care             | 4,573   | 4,617                          | (382)                              | 497              |\n| Personal Health            | 3,429   | 3,462                          | (131)                              | 590              |\n| Other                      | 519     | 531                            | (350)                              | (105)            |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (299)                          |                                    |                  |\n| Philips Group              | 17,156  | 17,156                         | (1,323)                            | 2,054            |\n| 2020                       |         |                                |                                    |                  |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment      | 8,175   | 8,289                          | (536)                              | 818              |\n| Connected Care             | 5,543   | 5,620                          | (414)                              | 1,191            |\n| Personal Health            | 3,199   | 3,198                          | (145)                              | 433              |\n| Other                      | 396     | 481                            | (368)                              | (165)            |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (275)                          |                                    |                  |\n| Philips Group              | 17,313  | 17,313                         | (1,462)                            | 2,277            |",

Net income is not allocated to segments as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITA In millions of EUR\n\n|                                                           | Philips Group   | Diagnosis & Treatment   | Connected Care   | Personal Health   | Other   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| 2022                                                      |                 |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Net Income                                                | (1,605)         |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Discontinued operations, net of income taxes              | (13)            |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Income tax expense                                        | (113)           |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Investments in associates, net of income taxes            | 2               |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Financial expenses                                        | 258             |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Financial income                                          | (58)            |                         |                  |                   |         |\n| Income from operations                                    | (1,529)         | 404                     | (2,246)          | 515               | (202)   |\n| Amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets | 363             | 143                     | 199              | 15                | 7       |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                    | 1,357           | 27                      | 1,331            |                   |         |\n| EBITA                                                     | 192             | 573                     | (716)            | 531               | (196)   |\n| Restructuring and acquisition-related charges             | 202             | 21                      | 108              | 11                | 61      |\n| Other items:                                              | 925             | 180                     | 703              | (4)               | 46      |\n| Respironics field-action provision                        | 250             |                         | 250              |                   |         |\n| Respironics field-action running remediation costs        | 210             |                         | 210              |                   |         |\n| R&D project impairments                                   | 134             | 120                     | 12               | 3                 |         |\n| Portfolio realignment charges                             | 109             |                         | 109              |                   |         |\n| Impairment of assets in S&RC                              | 39              |                         | 39               |                   |         |\n| Provision for public investigations tender irregularities | 60              | 60                      |                  |                   |         |\n| Provisions for quality actions in Connected Care          | 59              |                         | 59               |                   |         |\n| Remaining items                                           | 63              | -                       | 24               | (6)               | 46      |\n| Adjusted EBITA                                            | 1,318           | 774                     | 95               | 538               | (89)    |",

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or the fair value less costs of disposal. Depreciation or amortization of an asset ceases when it is classified as held-for-sale. When non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held-for-sale, comparative balances prior to such date are not represented in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the company that has either been disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Any gain or loss from disposal, together with the results of these operations until the date of disposal, are reported separately as discontinued operations in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe financial information of discontinued operations is excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods presented. Comparatives are re-presented for presentation of discontinued operations in the Consolidated statements of income and Consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe determination of the fair value less costs of disposal involves the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain. Circumstances to which these adjustments may relate include resolution of uncertainties that arise from the terms of the disposal transaction, such as the resolution of purchase price adjustments and indemnifications, resolution of uncertainties that arise from and are directly related to the operations of the component before its disposal, such as environmental and assurance-type product warranty obligations retained by the company, and the settlement of employee benefit plan obligations provided that the settlement is directly related to the disposal transaction.\n\nIn 2020, 2021 and 2022 Discontinued operations consist primarily of the Domestic Appliances business. The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations, net of income taxes, reported in the consolidated statements of income.",

Since the first quarter of 2021, the Domestic Appliances business is presented as a discontinued operation, and comparative results have been restated to reflect the treatment of the Domestic Appliances business as a discontinued operation, because the sale of the Domestic Appliances business constitutes the discontinuance of a major line of business from the Personal Health segment.\n\nThe following table summarizes the results of Domestic Appliances included in the Consolidated statements of income as a discontinued operation.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Results of Domestic Appliances in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                        | 2020    | 2021    | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Sales                                                  | 2,222   | 1,516   | 6      |\n| Costs and expenses                                     | (1,944) | (1,322) | (2)    |\n| Income from operations                                 | 279     | 194     | 4      |\n| Result on the sale of discontinued operations          |         | 3,241   | 1      |\n| Income before tax                                      | 279     | 3,435   | 5      |\n| Income tax expense 1)                                  | (72)    | 6       | (2)    |\n| Income tax related the sale of discontinued operations |         | (743)   |        |\n| Results from discontinued operations                   | 206     | 2,698   | 3      |\n\nCosts of EUR 64 million incurred in relation to the separation of the Domestic Appliances business in 2021 have been accounted for in continuing operations, because these costs reflect expenses incurred by Royal Philips in the divestment process and are not considered representative of the core business results of the Domestic Appliances business.\n\nOn September 1, 2021, the company completed the sale of the Domestic Appliances business and recognized a transaction gain before tax of EUR 3,241 million. Philips received consideration of EUR 4,041 million, which is based on an enterprise value of EUR 3,850 million, increased by an amount of EUR 191 million for closing adjustments related to working capital and net indebtedness. The transaction gain before tax is the net effect of (i) the EUR 4,041 million consideration (ii) less the derecognition of net assets employed of EUR 715 million (iii) less transaction related costs of EUR 16 million, (iv) less the release of cumulative translation losses of EUR 69 million included in Other comprehensive income. The income tax charges related to the divestment process was EUR 743 million, resulting in an after-tax transaction gain of EUR 2,499 million. The income tax charge represents the consolidated tax expense resulting from asset transactions completed as part of the disentanglement of the business in anticipation of its sale, a significant portion of which relates to taxes payable in the Netherlands. In addition, Philips and the buyer entered into a 15-year brand license agreement with future annual payments that represents an estimated net present value of approximately EUR 0.7 billion, which will be received and recognized over time.\n\n## Discontinued operations: Other\n\nCertain costs related to other divestments, which were previously reported as discontinued operations, resulted in a net gain of EUR 10 million in 2022, a net gain of EUR 13 million in 2021 and a net loss of EUR 10 million in 2020.\n\n## Discontinued operations cash flows\n\nThe following table presents the net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations reported in the Consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                         | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities    | 129    | 85     | (27)   |\n| Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities    |        | 3,319  | 15     |\n| Net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations | 129    | 3,403  | (12)   |\n\nIn 2022, net cash used for discontinued operations was EUR (12) million and consisted primarily of cash flows related to the tax claims from the previously divested business.\n\nIn 2021, net cash provided for discontinued operations was EUR 3,403 million and consisted primarily of the net cash inflow of EUR 3,319 million from the sale of the Domestic Appliances business on September 1, 2021.\n\nIn 2020, net cash provided for discontinued operations was EUR 129 million and consisted primarily of cash flows provided by operating activities of the Domestic Appliances business, partly offset by advance income tax payments amounting to EUR 78 million",

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date and is initially presented in Long-term provisions. When the timing and amount of the consideration become more certain, it is reclassified to Accrued liabilities. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nChanges to the initial fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, based on new information about the circumstances at the acquisition date, can be made up to twelve months after the acquisition date.\n\n## Divestments\n\nUpon loss of control, the company derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising from the loss of control is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. If the company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as either an equity-accounted investee (associate) or as a financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained. Further information on loss of control can be found in Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 156.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nIntangible assets acquired in a business acquisition and the financial liability related to noncontrolling interest are measured at fair value at the date of the acquisition.\n\nTo determine the fair value of intangible assets at the acquisition date, estimates and assumptions are required. The valuation of the identifiable intangible assets involves estimates of expected sales, earnings and/or future cash flows and require use of key assumptions such as discount rate, royalty rate and growth rates.\n\nEstimates are also applied when determining the fair value of legal cases and tax positions in the acquired entity. The fair value is based on estimates of the likelihood, the expected timing and the amount of the potential cash outflow. Provisions for legal cases and nonincome tax positions are recognized at fair value even if it is not probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation. After initial recognition and until the liability is settled, cancelled or expired, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognized in accordance with IAS 37 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' and the initial liability amount. For income tax positions, the company applies IAS 12 'Income Taxes', which requires recognition of provisions only when the likelihood of cash outflow is considered probable.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn 2022 Philips completed three acquisitions. The acquisitions involved aggregated net cash outflow of EUR 359 million and contingent consideration of EUR 96 million measured at fair value. Upon acquisition, the company recognized aggregated Goodwill of EUR 307 million, Other intangible assets of EUR 179 million, Deferred tax assets of EUR 20 million and Deferred tax liabilities generated from the intangible assets of EUR 43 million.\n\nVesper Medical Inc. (Vesper) was the most notable acquisition and is discussed below. The remaining two acquisitions involved aggregated net cash outflow of EUR 139 million and contingent consideration of EUR 61 million measured at fair value. The two acquisitions resulted in aggregated Goodwill of EUR 130 million, Other intangible assets of EUR 95 million and Deferred tax liabilities of EUR 23 million.\n\nThe opening balance sheet positions reflect the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the acquisitions. The final determination of the fair values will be completed in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the valuation studies necessary to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and the valuation of goodwill are preliminary.",

The sales and net income of the combined entities would not differ materially from these amounts if the acquisition date had been January 1, 2022. Acquisition-related costs were not material.\n\n## Vesper\n\nOn January 11, 2022, Philips acquired all shares of Vesper for an amount of EUR 227 million in cash and EUR 34 million contingent consideration at fair value. Vesper, headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania, US, is a medical technology company that develops minimally-invasive peripheral vascular devices. The company is developing the Vesper DUO Venous Stent System\u00ae, commercialization of which is estimated to start after approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expected in 2024. The Vesper DUO Venous Stent System\u00ae consists of venous stents intended to treat deep venous obstruction. It provides physicians with a modular portfolio to customize therapy, restore venous flow, and resolve the painful symptoms of deep venous disease for the broad range of patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency. As of the acquisition date, Vesper forms part of the Image-Guided Therapy business portfolio of the Diagnosis & Treatment segment.\n\nThe condensed opening balance sheet of Vesper was as follows:\n\n## Opening balance sheet in millions of EUR\n\n|                                             | At acquisition date Vesper Medical Inc,   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Assets                                      |                                           |\n| Intangible assets excluding goodwill        | 84                                        |\n| Deferred tax assets                         | 15                                        |\n| Cash                                        | 7                                         |\n| Total Assets                                | 106                                       |\n| Liabilities                                 |                                           |\n| Accounts payable and other payables         | (1)                                       |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                    | (20)                                      |\n| Total Liabilities                           | (21)                                      |\n| Total identifiable net assets at fair value | 85                                        |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition             | 177                                       |\n| Total purchase consideration                | 262                                       |\n| Of which:                                   |                                           |\n| Purchase consideration transferred          | 227                                       |\n| Contingent consideration                    | 34                                        |\n\nGoodwill recognized in the amount of EUR 177 million mainly represents revenue synergies expected from the combination of Philips' peripheral vascular portfolio and Vesper's venous stenting solution to address the root cause of chronic deep venous disease (DVD). Strong clinical synergies between Vesper's innovative stenting solution and Philips' existing peripheral vascular offering will help to better support clinicians to decide, guide, treat and confirm during the procedure, thereby enhancing patient care. Vesper Goodwill is not taxdeductible.\n\nThe majority of the Intangible assets balance relates to capitalized development costs, the fair value of which is determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. The fair value of capitalized development costs is based on an estimate of positive future cash flows associated with incremental profits related to excess earnings, discounted at a rate of 12.0%. Capitalized development costs are tested for impairment on an annual basis until FDA approval is obtained and the asset is reclassified to an intangible asset that is depreciated over its economical useful life.\n\nThe contingent consideration arrangement requires Philips to pay the former owners of Vesper up to a maximum undiscounted amount of EUR 44 million contingent upon FDA approval of the Vesper DUO Venous Stent System. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of EUR 34 million has been estimated by calculating the present value of the future expected cash flows.

As a result, BioTelemetry shares were delisted from NASDAQ. The total equity purchase price and the settlement of stock option rights, including BioTelemetry's cash and debt, involved an amount of EUR 2,132 million and EUR 172 million equity awards consideration paid to employees after the acquisition day.\n\nBioTelemetry, headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, is a leading US-based provider of remote cardiac diagnostics and monitoring solutions. BioTelemetry offers a complete range of clinically validated ambulatory cardiac diagnostics and monitoring services: Short term Holter monitoring services, Long-term Holter monitoring services, Event recorder services, and Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) services. The acquisition of BioTelemetry is a strong fit with Philips' cardiac care portfolio, and its strategy to transform the delivery of care along the health continuum with integrated solutions. BioTelemetry, forms part of the Connected Care segment.\n\nGoodwill recognized in the amount of EUR 1,790 million mainly represents revenue synergies expected from the combination of Philips' cardiac care portfolio and its strategy to transform the delivery of care along the health continuum with integrated solutions, and BioTelemetry complete range of clinically validated ambulatory cardiac diagnostics and monitoring services. BioTelemetry Goodwill is not tax-deductible.\n\nThe majority of the Intangible assets balance relates to the Customer relationships asset, the fair value of which is determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. The fair value of the Customer relationships asset is based on an estimate of positive future cash flows associated with incremental profits related to excess earnings, discounted at a rate of 10.0%. The amortization period of the Customer relationships asset is 14 years. Receivables and other current assets reflect the best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows expected to be received.\n\nSince the acquisition date through December 31, 2021, the contribution to sales to third parties and net income of BioTelemetry was EUR 387 million and EUR 32 million loss, respectively. The sales and net income would not differ materially from these amounts if the acquisition date had been on January 1, 2021.\n\nIn 2021, acquisition-related costs of EUR 40 million were mainly recognized in General and administrative expenses.\n\n## Capsule Technologies\n\nOn March 4, 2021, Philips acquired all shares of Capsule Technologies, Inc. for an amount of EUR 520 million in cash. Capsule Technologies, headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, is a leading provider of medical device integration and data technologies for hospitals and healthcare organizations. Capsule Technologies offers a leading vendor-neutral Medical Device Information Platform with a software-as-a-service business model. The acquisition of Capsule Technologies is a strong fit with Philips' strategy to transform the delivery of care along the health continuum with integrated solutions. Capsule Technologies, forms part of the Connected Care segment.\n\nGoodwill recognized in the amount of EUR 322 million mainly represents revenue synergies expected from the combination of Philips' industry-leading portfolio of real-time patient monitoring, therapeutic devices, telehealth, informatics and interoperability solutions and Capsule's leading Medical Device Information Platform, connected through Philips' secure vendor-neutral cloud-based HealthSuite digital platform. Capsule Technologies Goodwill is not tax-deductible.",

The amortization period of the Customer relationships asset is 17 years.\n\nReceivables and other current assets reflect the best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows expected to be received.\n\nSince the acquisition date through December 31, 2021, the contribution to sales to third parties and net income of Capsule was EUR 75 million and EUR 10 million loss, respectively. The sales and net income would not differ materially from these amounts if the acquisition date had been on January 1, 2021.\n\nIn 2021, acquisition-related costs of EUR 11 million were mainly recognized in General and administrative expenses.\n\n## Divestments\n\nDuring 2021 Philips completed three divestments. On September 1, 2021, Philips sold its Domestic Appliances business to global investment firm Hillhouse Investment. For further details on this transaction, refer to note Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 156.\n\nIn addition, the company completed the divestment of the PERS business on June 30, 2021 and completed the divestment of a small business of segment Other on September 17, 2021. As part of PERS divestment, Philips acquired shares in the buyer Connect America Investment Holdings, LLC with a value of EUR 40 million. The investment is classified as a financial asset measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) and is reported as part of Other non-current financial assets. The divestment resulted in a loss of EUR 75 million, which is included in Other Business Expenses in the Statement of Income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interests in entities\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAssociates are all entities over which the company has significant influence, but not control or joint control. Significant influence is presumed with a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of an investment in associate includes the carrying amount of goodwill identified on acquisition. An impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\nThe company's share of the net income of these associates is included in Investments in associates, net of income taxes, in the Consolidated statements of income, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the company. Dilution gains and losses arising from investments in associates are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income as part of Investments in associates, net of income taxes. Impairment losses and gains or losses on sale of investments are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income, more specifically on the line item 'Investments in associates, net of income taxes'.\n\nWhen the company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the company has an obligation or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nThe nature of the company's interests in its consolidated entities and associates, and the effects of those interests on the company's financial position and financial performance are discussed below.\n\n## Group companies\n\nBelow is a list of material subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 representing greater than 5% of either the consolidated group Sales, Income from operations or Income from continuing operations (before any intra-group eliminations) of Group legal entities. All of the entities are fully consolidated in the group financial statements.",

In 2022, Sales to third parties and Net income for these subsidiaries in aggregate are EUR 472 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 522 million) and EUR 28 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 39 million), respectively.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nPhilips has investments in a number of associates. During 2022, Philips purchased eight investments in associates for a total amount of EUR 256 million. The most notable investment was a EUR 172 million investment in B-SOFT Co, Ltd, a China-based IT supplier for the medical and health sectors, listed on the stock exchange in Shenzhen. Philips acquired only a 10% interest, but determined that it is able to exercise significant influence amongst others due to its representation on B-SOFT's Board of Directors. None of these investments are regarded as individually material from the point of view of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2022, Philips recorded an impairment of EUR 66 million in relation to its interest in Candid Care Co. As part of the acquisition of Affera, Inc. by Medtronic plc in August 2022, the company sold its investment in Affera to Medtronic and recorded a gain of EUR 84 million on the sale.\n\nCumulative translation adjustments related to investments in associates were EUR 22 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 32 million).\n\n## Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities\n\nPhilips founded three Philips Medical Capital (PMC) entities, in the United States, France and Germany, in which Philips holds a minority interest. Philips Medical Capital, LLC in the United States is the most significant entity. PMC entities provide healthcare equipment financing and leasing services to Philips customers for diagnostic imaging equipment, patient monitoring equipment, and clinical IT systems.\n\nThe company concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate the PMC entities. In the United States, PMC operates as a subsidiary of De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. The same structure and treatment is applied to the PMC entities in the other countries, with other majority shareholders. Operating agreements are in place for all PMC entities, whereby acceptance of sales and financing transactions resides with the respective majority shareholder. After acceptance of a transaction by PMC, Philips transfers control and does not retain any obligations towards PMC or its customers, from the sales contracts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Philips' shareholding in Philips Medical Capital, LLC had a carrying value of EUR 29 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 27 million).\n\nThe company does not have any material exposures to losses from interests in unconsolidated structured entities other than the invested amounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Income from operations 6\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe company recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration (i.e., transaction price) to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the good or service. The consideration expected by the company may include fixed and/or variable amounts which can be impacted by sales returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. The company adjusts the consideration for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds six months.\n\nTransfer of control varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale. For consumer-type products in the segment Personal Health businesses, control is transferred when the product is shipped and delivered to the customer and title and risk have passed to the customer (depending on the delivery conditions) and acceptance of the product has been obtained.",

The stand-alone selling price is the price that would be charged for the goods or service in a separate transaction under similar conditions to similar customers. The transaction price is determined (considering variable considerations) and allocated to performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. These transactions mainly occur in the segments Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care businesses and include arrangements that require subsequent installation and training activities to make distinct goods operable for the customer. As such, the related installation and training activities are part of equipment sales rather than separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the installation has been completed and the equipment is ready to be used by the customer in the way contractually agreed.\n\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. Such assessment is performed on each reporting date to check whether it is constrained. For products for which a right of return exists during a defined period, revenue recognition is determined based on the historical pattern of actual returns, or in cases where such information is not available, revenue recognition is postponed until the return period has lapsed. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets. A provision is recognized for assurance-type product warranty at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by the company with respect to the products sold. For certain products, the customer has the option to purchase the warranty separately, which is considered a separate performance obligation on top of the assurance-type product warranty. For such warranties which provide distinct service, revenue recognition occurs on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty contract period.\n\nIn the case of loss under a sales agreement, the loss is recognized immediately.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, based on the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation.\n\n## Revenue from services\n\nRevenues are recognized over time as the company transfers control of the services to the customer which is demonstrated by the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits provided by the company. The amount of revenues is measured by reference to the progress made towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, which in general is evenly over time. Service revenue related to repair and maintenance activities for goods sold is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are rendered.\n\n## Income from royalties\n\nRoyalty income from brand license arrangements and from intellectual property rights, such as technology licenses or patents, is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\n## Shipping and handling\n\nExpenses incurred for shipping and handling are mainly recorded as cost of sales. When shipping and handling are part of a project and billed to the customer, then the related expenses are recorded as cost of sales. Shipping and handling related to sales to third parties are partly recorded as selling expenses. When shipping and handling billed to customers are considered a distinct and separate performance obligation, the fees are recognized as revenue and costs included in cost of sales.\n\n## Other business income (expenses)\n\nOther business income (expenses) includes gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment, gains and losses on the sale of businesses as well as other gains and losses not related to the company's operating activities.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from governments are recognized at their fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the company will comply with the conditions. Grants related to costs are deferred in the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a reduction of the related costs that they are intended to compensate. Grants related to assets are deducted from the cost of the asset and presented net in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\n## Sales-related accruals\n\nThe company has sales promotions-related agreements with distributors and retailers designed to promote the sale of products. Among the programs are arrangements under which rebates and discounts can be earned by the distributors and retailers by attaining agreed upon sales levels, or for participating in specific marketing programs. Management estimates the sales-related accruals associated with these arrangements based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding which promotional targets are expected to be met by distributors and retailers. Accrued customer rebates are presented as other current liabilities, unless there is a right to offset against the respective accounts receivable.",

The decrease in other financial income is mainly due to higher interest income on tax in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Financial income and expenses decreased by EUR 5 million year-on-year, mainly due to higher other financial income and lower interest expense, offset by lower fair value gain. Fair value gains of EUR 95 million are from investments in limited-life funds (mainly Gilde Healthcare) and other investments recognized at fair value through profit or loss. Net interest expense in 2021 was EUR 19 million lower than in 2020, mainly due to lower interest expense on borrowings and provisions, and interest expense on pensions. The increase in other financial income is mainly due to higher interest income on tax.\n\n## Income taxes 8\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIncome taxes comprise current, non-current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected taxes payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nIn cases where it is concluded it is not probable that tax authorities will accept a tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty is reflected in the recognition and measurement of tax assets and liabilities or, alternatively, a provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this can be reasonably estimated. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax assets and liabilities. Such changes to tax assets and liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period during which such a determination is made.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the consolidated balance sheets method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the respective temporary difference can be controlled by the company and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that\n\nare expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities, but the company intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits against which they can be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible. Changes in tax rates and tax laws are reflected in the period when the change was enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nAny subsequent adjustment to a tax asset or liability that originated in discontinued operations and for which no specific arrangements were made at the time of divestment, due to a change in the tax base or its measurement, is allocated to discontinued operations (i.e. backwards tracing). Examples are a tax rate change or change in retained assets or liabilities directly relating to the discontinued operation. Any subsequent change to the recognition of deferred tax assets is allocated to the component in which the taxable gain is or will be recognized. The above principles are applied to the extent the 'discontinued operations' are sufficiently separable from continuing operations.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\n## Deferred tax recoverability\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits against which these can be utilized. Significant judgment is involved in determining whether such profits are probable. Management determines this on the basis of expected taxable profits arising from the reversal of recognized deferred tax liabilities, appropriate tax planning opportunities to support business goals and on the basis of forecasts.",

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\n\nNet deferred tax assets relate to the following underlying assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit carryforwards) and their movements during the years 2022 and 2021 respectively are presented in the following tables.\n\nThe net deferred tax assets of EUR 2,358 million (2021: EUR 2,134 million) consist of deferred tax assets of EUR 2,449 million (2021: EUR 2,216 million) and deferred tax liabilities of EUR 91 million (2021: EUR 83 million). Of the total deferred tax assets of EUR 2,449 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 2,216 million), EUR 1,453 million (2021: EUR 12 million) is recognized in respect of entities in various countries where there have been tax losses in the current or preceding period. The increase is mainly related to the United States where there has been a tax loss in 2022, among others due to the consequences of the Respironics field action. Management's projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax losses as well the deductible temporary differences. The projections include forward-looking assumptions whereby the most recent available information was used to determine the expected period of recovery of the deferred tax assets. Relevant developments potentially impacting the period and probability of recovery will be monitored closely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 the temporary differences associated with investments, including potential income tax consequences on dividends, for which no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, aggregate to EUR 355 million (2021: EUR 298 million).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities in millions of EUR\n\n|                                               | Balance as of January 1, 2022   | recognized in income statement   | other 1)   | Balance as of December 31, 2022   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Intangible assets                             | 587                             | 63                               | (20)       | 630                               | 783      | (152)         |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 29                              | (33)                             | 2          | (2)                               | 49       | (52)          |\n| Inventories                                   | 372                             | 75                               | 17         | 464                               | 473      | (8)           |\n| Other assets                                  | 68                              | (16)                             | (8)        | 44                                | 98       | (55)          |\n| Pensions and other employee benefits          | 180                             | 6                                | (32)       | 153                               | 175      | (22)          |\n| Other liabilities                             | 499                             | (34)                             | 17         | 483                               | 560      | (77)          |\n| Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards | 398                             | 149                              | 38         | 586                               | 586      |               |\n| Set-off deferred tax positions                |                                 |                                  |            |                                   | (275)    | 275           |\n| Net deferred tax assets                       | 2,134                           | 210                              | 14         | 2,358                             | 2,449    | (91)          |\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities in millions of EUR\n\n|                                               | Balance as of January 1, 2021   | recognized in income statement   | other 1)   | Balance as of December 31, 2021   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Intangible assets                             | 240                             | 535                              | (188)      | 587                               | 716      | (130)         |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 32                              | 13                               | (16)       | 29                                | 55       | (26)          |\n| Inventories                                   | 313                             | 31                               | 28         | 372                               | 381      | (9)           |\n| Other assets                                  | 97                              | (30)                             | 1          | 68                                | 112      | (43)          |\n| Pensions and other employee benefits          | 245                             | (45)                             | (21)       | 180                               | 182      | (2)           |\n| Other liabilities                             | 384                             | 91                               | 25         | 499                               | 584      | (84)          |\n| Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards | 449                             | (194)                            | 143        | 398                               | 398      |               |\n| Set-off deferred tax positions                |                                 |                                  |            |                                   | (211)    | 211           |\n| Net deferred tax assets                       | 1,761                           | 401                              | (28)       | 2,134                             | 2,216    | (83)          |",

The unrecognized balance as of December 31, 2021 (expiring within 1 year, EUR 1,592 million) which were partly utilized and the remainder expired unutilized.\n\n## Tax risks\n\nPhilips is exposed to tax risks and uncertainty over tax treatments. For particular tax treatments that are not expected to be accepted by tax authorities, Philips either recognizes a liability or reflects the uncertainty in the recognition and measurement of its current and deferred tax assets and tax attributes. For the measurement of the uncertainty, Philips uses the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment. The expected liabilities resulting from the uncertain tax treatments are included in non-current tax liabilities (2022: EUR 435 million, 2021: EUR 544 million, decrease due to release of liabilities, in combination with higher tax losses or similar tax carryforwards that can be used if uncertain tax treatments were settled for the presumed amount at balance sheet date). The positions include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing risks\n\nPhilips has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines such as those of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives. However, tax disputes can arise due to inconsistent transfer pricing regimes and different views on \"at arm's length\" pricing.\n\n## Tax risks on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities (such as research and development, IT and group functions), costs are also centralized. As a consequence, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Philips entities. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with a large number of group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements, and may reject the implemented intra-group charges. Furthermore, buy in/out situations in the case of (de)mergers could affect the cost allocation resulting from the intragroup service agreements between countries. The same applies to the specific service agreements.\n\n## Tax risks due to disentanglements and acquisitions\n\nWhen a subsidiary of Philips is disentangled, or a new company is acquired, tax risks may arise. Philips creates merger and acquisition (M&A) teams for these disentanglements or acquisitions. In addition to representatives from the involved business, these teams consist of specialists from various group functions and are formed, among other things, to identify tax risks and to reduce potential tax claims.\n\n## Tax risks due to permanent establishments\n\nA permanent establishment may arise when a Philips entity has activities in another country, tax claims could arise in both countries on the same income.",

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the period, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares, which comprise performance shares, restricted shares and share options granted under share-based compensation plans as well as forward contracts to repurchase shares.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Earnings per share in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n## 1)\n\n|                                                                                                              | 2020        | 2021        | 2022        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Income from continuing operations                                                                            | 999         | 612         | (1,618)     |\n| Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders                                               | 991         | 608         | (1,622)     |\n| Income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests                                  | 8           | 4           | 3           |\n| Income from discontinued operations                                                                          | 196         | 2,711       | 13          |\n| Income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders                                             | 196         | 2,711       | 13          |\n| Net income                                                                                                   | 1,195       | 3,323       | (1,605)     |\n| Net income attributable to shareholders                                                                      | 1,187       | 3,319       | (1,608)     |\n| Net income attributable to non-controlling interests                                                         | 8           | 4           | 3           |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the period  | 907,721,150 | 904,271,675 | 881,615,862 |\n| Plus incremental shares from assumed conversions of:                                                         |             |             |             |\n| Share options                                                                                                | 757,622     | 387,125     | 25,506      |\n| Performance shares                                                                                           | 5,561,501   | 2,548,891   | 1,147,790   |\n| Restricted shares                                                                                            | 2,584,728   | 2,376,736   | 1,986,538   |\n| Forward contracts to repurchase shares                                                                       |             | 70,329      | 17,611,920  |\n| Dilutive potential common shares 2)                                                                          | 8,903,851   | 5,383,080   | 20,771,753  |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the period | 916,625,001 | 909,654,754 | 881,615,862 |\n| Basic earnings per common share in EUR                                                                       |             |             |             |\n| Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders                                               | 1.09        | 0.67        | (1.84)      |\n| Income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders                                             | 0.22        | 3.00        | 0.02        |\n| Net income attributable to shareholders                                                                      | 1.31        | 3.67        | (1.82)      |\n| Diluted earnings per common share in EUR 2)                                                                  |             |             |             |\n| Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders                                               | 1.08        | 0.67        | (1.84)      |\n| Income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders                                             | 0.21        | 2.98        | 0.02        |\n| Net income attributable to shareholders                                                                      | 1.29        | 3.65        | (1.82)      |\n| Dividend distributed per common share in EUR                                                                 | 0.85        | 0.85        | 0.85        |",

Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. When assets under construction are ready for their intended use, they are transferred to the relevant asset category and depreciation starts. All other property, plant and equipment items are depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment Philips Group\n\n| Buildings                   | from 5 to 50 years   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Machinery and installations | from 3 to 20 years   |\n| Other equipment             | from 1 to 10 years   |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the assets concerned may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's book value exceeds their recoverable amount. Impairments are reversed if and to the extent that the impairment no longer exists. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nGains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless they extend the asset's original lifetime or capacity.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe company leases various items of real estate, vehicles and other equipment. The company determines whether an arrangement constitutes or contains a lease based on the substance of the arrangement at the lease inception. The arrangement constitutes or contains a lease if fulfillment is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that asset is not explicitly specified in the arrangement.\n\n## Company as a lessee\n\nThe company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for shortterm and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets.\n\n## Company as a lessor\n\nWhen the company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases in which the company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. The company recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\n## Impairment of owned and right-of-use assets\n\nJudgments are required, not only to determine whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, but also whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognized may no longer exist or may have decreased (impairment reversal). After indications of impairment have been identified, estimates and assumptions are used in the determination of the recoverable amount of a fixed asset. These involve estimates of expected future cash flows (based on future growth rates and remaining useful life) and residual value assumptions, as well as discount rates to calculate the present value of the future cash flows.\n\n## Owned assets\n\nEstimates are required to determine the (remaining) useful lives of fixed assets. Useful lives are determined based on an asset's age, the frequency of its use, repair and maintenance policy, technology changes in production and expected restructuring. The company estimates the expected residual value per asset item. The residual value is the higher of the asset's expected sales price (based on recent market transactions of similar sold items) and its material scrap value.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the lease term. The assessment of whether the company is reasonably certain to exercise extension options impacts the lease term, which could affect the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.",

Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require. Internal or external sources of information are considered to assess if there are indicators that an asset or a CGU may be impaired. In most cases the company identifies its cash-generating units for goodwill at one level below that of an operating segment. Cash flows at this level are substantially independent from other cash flows and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Executive Committee. An impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, whichever is the greater, its value in use or its fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is measured as the amount obtained from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, less costs of disposal.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe cash flow projections used in the value in use calculations for goodwill impairment testing contain various judgments and estimations as described in the key assumptions sections below.",

This was partially offset by EUR 15 million of impairment losses primarily related to the PERS CGU and EUR 189 million divested in the period, mostly relating to the Domestic Appliances business. For details on the impact of new acquisitions and the divestment of the Domestic Appliances business, refer to Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 158.\n\n## Goodwill reallocations in 2022 and 2021\n\nIn 2022 and 2021 there were changes to the CGU structure following internal reorganizations. These resulted in a goodwill reallocation across certain CGUs, none of which had a significant impact on headroom or led to goodwill impairments. These reallocations were performed using a relative value approach. In addition there were also certain CGU movements and/or combinations within businesses that did not result in a reallocation of goodwill, but resulted in changes to the business structure. This did not have a significant impact on headroom or lead to goodwill impairments.\n\n## Impairments\n\nDuring 2022 goodwill impairment charges of EUR 1,357 million were recognized. This relates to the third quarter impairment charge of EUR 1,331 million in the Sleep & Respiratory Care (S&RC) CGU of the Connected Care segment. In addition, as a result of the annual impairment testing a goodwill impairment charge of EUR 27 million was recognized in relation to the Precision Diagnosis Solutions (PDS) CGU which is part of the Diagnosis & Treatment segment. The value in use methodology was used to estimate the recoverable amount for the PDS CGU.\n\nDuring 2021 an impairment charge of EUR 15 million was recognized. The majority of this related to the PERS CGU which was classified as an asset held for sale as of Q4 2020. The PERS CGU was divested as of June 30, 2021. Prior to the divestment a goodwill impairment of EUR 13 million was recorded to reflect a decrease in the recoverable amount of the CGU, this reduced the goodwill balance of the CGU to zero. The fair value less cost of disposal methodology was used to estimate the recoverable amount for the PERS CGU, this was based on Level 3 inputs. Key assumptions and inputs used in the calculation included the signed purchase agreement for the PERS divestment. The impairment of EUR 13 million was recorded in the Connected Care segment.\n\n## Interim goodwill impairment testing\n\nAs explained in the accounting policy above, goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require. In the third quarter of 2022, an impairment indicator was noted in relation to the S&RC CGU as a consequence of revisions to the expected future cashflows of the CGU. The drivers of the revised forecast (which form the basis for the future cashflow assumptions) were current assumptions regarding the estimated impact of a consent decree that is currently under discussion with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), acting on behalf of the FDA, along with updates to expected business performance and changes to the pre-tax discount rate. An impairment test was performed in order to determine if the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeded the unit's recoverable amount, which was determined on a value in use basis. As a result of this test a goodwill impairment charge of EUR 1,331 million was recognized. Following the impairment charge, the estimated recoverable amount, based on the CGU's value in use, for the S&RC CGU was EUR 1,001 million and equal to its carrying value.",

These assumptions included the expected financial impact of the scope and duration of a consent decree, as well as expected additional costs. These assumptions were determined by management based on discussions held in relation to the consent decree and other available sources of information.\n\n## Annual goodwill impairment testing\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (typically one level below segment level, i.e. at the business level), which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash generating units Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics, Hospital Patient Monitoring and Image-Guided Therapy is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill for the Group as of December 31, 2022. The amounts associated as of December 31, 2022 are presented in the following table:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                           | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics                       | 1,897  | 2,215  |\n| Hospital Patient Monitoring                               | 1,663  | 1,806  |\n| Image-Guided Therapy                                      | 2,802  | 3,154  |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care                                  | 2,031  | 731    |\n| Other (units carrying a non-significant goodwill balance) | 2,245  | 2,332  |\n| Book value                                                | 10,637 | 10,238 |\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the basis of the recoverable amount used in the annual impairment tests for the units disclosed further in this note is the value in use. The fair value less cost of disposal methodology was used as a basis for the recoverable amount in the annual impairment test when greater than the value-in-use test. Refer to the 'key assumptionsgeneral' section for further detail on the methodology.\n\n## Key assumptions - general\n\nKey assumptions used in the value-in-use impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA *) in the terminal value and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections were determined using Royal Philips managements' internal forecasts that cover an initial forecast period from 2023 to 2025. Projections were extrapolated with stable or declining growth rates for an extrapolation period of 4 years (2026-2029), after which a terminal value was calculated per 2030. For the terminal value calculation, growth rates were capped at a historical long-term average growth rate. In the case of the Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics CGU management's internal forecasts were used in the value in use test for a period of 5 years (2023-2027).\n\nThe sales growth rates and EBITA *) used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions and industry long-term growth averages. EBITA *) in all units mentioned in this note is expected to increase over the projection period as a result of volume growth and cost efficiencies.\n\nIn 2022 there continued to be uncertainty and volatility related to global, industry-wide macroeconomic challenges including global supply chain constraints, COVID lockdown measures in China, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine war. Where relevant, and to the extent possible, the estimated impact of these factors and the resulting uncertainties have been reflected in the forecasts used for the value-in-use calculations. As was the case in 2021, the company uses scenarios in the business forecasting process and the most reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent management's best estimate are used as the basis for the value-in-use tests.",

The WACC is based on post-tax cost of equity and cost of debt, and is further calculated based on market data and inputs to accurately capture changes to the time value of money, such as the risk-free interest rate, the beta factor and country risk premium. In order to properly reflect the different risk-profiles of different businesses, a WACC is determined for each business. As such, the beta factor is determined based on a selection of peer companies, which can differ per business. Different businesses have different geographical footprints, resulting in business-specific inputs for variables like country risk. Philips performs the value in use calculation using post-tax cashflows and discount rate, the implicit pre-tax rate discount rate is derived from an iterative calculation for disclosure purposes.\n\nIn 2022 the pre-tax discount rates increased for all CGUs primarily due to the impact on the WACC of higher interest rates. As explained above, for S&RC this increased pre-tax discount rate contributed to the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n## Key assumptions and sensitivity analysis relating to cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated\n\nIn 2022 cash flow projections of Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics, Hospital Patient Monitoring, Image-Guided Therapy and Sleep & Respiratory Care are based on the key assumptions included in the following table, which were used in the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Key assumptions 2022\n\n|                                     | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)       |                        |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                     | initial forecast period         | extrapolation period 2)         | used to calculate terminal value 3) | pre-tax discount rates |\n| Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics | 15.4%                           | 9.5%                            | 2.5%                                | 8.5%                   |\n| Hospital Patient Monitoring         | 4.8%                            | 3.4%                            | 2.5%                                | 8.5%                   |\n| Image-Guided Therapy                | 8.7%                            | 5.0%                            | 2.5%                                | 10.6%                  |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care            | 10.0%                           | 5.0%                            | 2.5%                                | 9.9%                   |\n\n## The assumptions used for the 2021 cash flow projections were as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Key assumptions 2021\n\n|                                     | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)       |                        |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                     | initial forecast period         | extrapolation period 2)         | used to calculate terminal value 3) | pre-tax discount rates |\n| Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics | 24.5%                           | 11.9%                           | 2.5%                                | 7.3%                   |\n| Hospital Patient Monitoring         | 5.4%                            | 3.4%                            | 2.5%                                | 7.8%                   |\n| Image-Guided Therapy                | 10.2%                           | 5.4%                            | 2.5%                                | 8.9%                   |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care            | 9.2%                            | 5.0%                            | 2.5%                                | 9.2%                   |\n\nImpairment tests are performed based on forward looking assumptions, using the most recent available information. By their nature, these assumptions involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances and there are many factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set forth in these assumptions.\n\nIn performing the value-in-use test for the S&RC CGU it was necessary for management to make assumptions regarding the estimated impact of a consent decree on the business. These assumptions included the expected financial impact of the scope and duration of a consent decree, as well as expected additional costs. These assumptions were determined by management based on discussions held in relation to the consent decree and other available sources of information. There have been no significant changes to these assumptions since the interim goodwill testing in the third quarter of 2022 (see Interim Goodwill impairment testing section above).",

However, following the interim impairment charge, the annual impairment test indicates that the value in use of the CGU remains sensitive to the assumptions set out above. This means that there is a higher risk that deviations in the mentioned key assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to fall below the level of its carrying value. There continues to be significant uncertainty associated with the initiated voluntary recall notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for certain sleep and respiratory care products, the associated legal matters and the outcome of a consent decree. The legal matters are described in further detail in Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\nBased on the annual impairment test of Sleep & Respiratory Care, it was noted that an increase of 40 basis points in the pre-tax discount rate, a 160 basis points decline in the compound long-term sales growth rate or a 7% decrease in terminal value would, individually, cause its recoverable amount to fall to the level of its carrying value. Additionally, any significant adverse changes to the assumptions related to the expected financial impact of a consent decree could cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to fall below its carrying value, resulting in impairment.\n\nThe results of the annual impairment tests of the Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics CGU indicate that the value in use of the CGUs is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. This means that there is a higher risk that deviations in the mentioned key assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to fall below the level of its carrying value. Based on the annual impairment test of Ambulatory Monitoring & Diagnostics, it was noted that an increase of 40 basis points in the pre-tax discount rate, a 210 basis points decline in the compound long-term sales growth rate or a 8% decrease in terminal value would, individually, cause its recoverable amount to fall to the level of its carrying value.\n\nThe results of the annual impairment test of Hospital Patient Monitoring and Image-Guided Therapy indicate that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value.\n\n## Additional information relating to cash-generating units to which a nonsignificant amount relative to the total goodwill is allocated\n\nThe results of the annual impairment tests of the Emergency Care CGU indicate that the value in use of the CGU is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. This means that there is a higher risk that deviations in the mentioned key assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to fall below the level of its carrying value. Based on the annual impairment test of Emergency Care, it was noted that an increase of 190 basis points in the pre-tax discount rate, a 900 basis points decline in the compound long-term sales growth rate or a 26% decrease in terminal value would, individually, cause its recoverable amount to fall to the level of its carrying value.\n\nWith the exception of those described above, for the cash generating units to which a nonsignificant amount relative to the total goodwill is allocated, any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value.",

The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the exception of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, which are capitalized at their acquisition date fair value.\n\nThe company expenses all research costs as incurred. Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the company has sufficient resources and the intention to complete development and can measure the attributable expenditure reliably.\n\nThe capitalized development expenditure comprises of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.\n\nThe expected useful lives of the intangible assets excluding goodwill are as follows:\n\nPhilips Group\n\n## Expected useful lives of intangible assets excluding goodwill in years\n\n| Brand names            | 2-20   |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Customer relationships | 2-25   |\n| Technology             | 3-20   |\n| Other                  | 1-10   |\n| Software               | 1-10   |\n| Product development    | 3-10   |\n\nThe weighted average expected remaining life of brand names, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets is 9.4 years as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 9.6 years).\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nIntangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require. In the case of intangible assets not yet ready for use, either internal or external sources of information are considered to assess if there are indicators that an asset or a CGU may be impaired.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets\n\nNon-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is measured as the amount obtained from a sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, less costs of disposal. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods for Intangible assets other than goodwill are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe cash flow projections used in the value in use calculations for intangible assets excluding goodwill contain various judgments and estimations. For intangible assets excluding goodwill, estimates are required to determine the (remaining) useful lives.",

For more information, refer to Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 158.\n\nImpairments in 2022 were EUR 276 million (2021: EUR 126 million) and mainly relate to technology (EUR 46 million) and product development (EUR 204 million), including product development construction in progress. In the third quarter of 2022 an initiative was undertaken to enhance productivity in R&D, specifically to shift the focus to fewer, highimpact projects in the innovation pipeline. As a result of this initiative EUR 132 million of product development (including product development construction in progress) asset impairments were recognized.\n\nThe most notable impairments in 2022, recognized as part of the above productivity initiative, were in the Diagnosis & Treatment segment, for product development assets in Precision Diagnosis (PD) of EUR 36 million and Image Guided Therapy-Systems (IGT Systems) of EUR 41 million (EUR 16 million of which was product development construction in progress). The basis of the recoverable amount used in these tests was the value-in-use. After the impairment charge the recoverable amount of the related intangible assets is EUR 0 million.\n\nIn 2022 there continued to be uncertainty and volatility related to by global, industry-wide macroeconomic challenges including global supply chain constraints, COVID lockdown measures in China, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine war. Where relevant, and to the extent possible, the estimated impact of these factors and the resulting uncertainties have been reflected in the forecasts used for the VIU calculations. As was the case in 2021, the company uses scenarios in the business forecasting process and the most reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent management's best estimate are used as the basis for the value-in-use tests\n\nThe amortization of intangible assets is specified in Income from operations, starting on page 162.\n\nThe most notable intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 relate to the BioTelemetry customer relationships and technology with a carrying value of EUR 385 million and EUR 150 million and a remaining amortization period of 14 years and 10 years, respectively and Spectranetics customer relationships and technology with a carrying value of EUR 291 million and EUR 203 million and a remaining amortization period of 15 years and 10 years, respectively. The most notable intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 relate to the BioTelemetry customer relationships and technology with value of EUR 391 million and EUR",

If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the company measures the loss allowance for the financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months of expected credit losses. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the company measures the loss allowance for the financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime-expected credit\n\nlosses. For all trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables the company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime-expected credit losses.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe determination of fair value is subject to estimates for investments that are not publicly traded. Refer to Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 214\n\nFinancial assets classified at amortized cost and at fair value through OCI are subject to impairment assessment. The calculation of expected credit losses requires the company to apply significant judgment and make estimates and assumptions that involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes to the timing and amount of expected credit losses to be recognized.\n\n## Other current financial assets\n\nIn 2022, Other current financial assets increased from EUR 2 million to EUR 11 million (2021: increased from EUR nil million to EUR 2 million).",

The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, considering the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, firstout (FIFO) method.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nInventory is reduced for the estimated losses due to obsolescence. This reduction is determined for groups of products based on sales in the recent past and/or expected future demand.\n\n## Inventories are summarized as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Inventories in millions of EUR\n\n|                            | 2021   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Raw materials and supplies | 1,143  | 1,541  |\n| Work in process            | 646    | 648    |\n| Finished goods             | 1,660  | 1,860  |\n| Inventories                | 3,450  | 4,049  |\n\nThe write-down of inventories to net realizable value was EUR 215 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 177 million). The write-down is included in cost of sales.\n\nIn 2022, the limited availability and delays in the supply of certain components and products internationally, resulted in an increase in inventories compared to December 31, 2021, as work in process inventories could not be translated to finished goods available for sale due to the scarcity of certain components. While there was an increase in inventories, this has not resulted in a significant write-down of inventories, as the expectation is that such components will become available in the near future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Receivables 16\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nReceivables are held by the company to collect the related cash flows. These receivables are measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost minus any impairment losses.\n\nReceivables are derecognized when the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards, which includes transactions in which the company enters into factoring transactions, or if the company does not retain control over the receivables.\n\n## Accounting estimates\n\nReceivables are subject to impairment assessment, which involves estimating expected credit losses. Refer to Other financial assets, starting on page 184 for accounting policies on impairment of financial assets.\n\n## Non-current receivables\n\nNon-current receivables are associated mainly with customer financing in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses amounting to EUR 70 million (2021: EUR 44 million), for Signify indemnification amounting to EUR 26 million (2021: EUR 46 million), an income tax receivable amounting to EUR 126 million (which includes an interest receivable of EUR 10 million) for which Philips expects to get a refund (2021: EUR 78 million) and insurance receivables in Other in the US amounting to EUR 30 million (2021: EUR 37 million).\n\n## Current receivables\n\nCurrent receivables of EUR 4,115 million (2021: EUR 3,787 million) as of December 31, 2022 included trade accounts receivable (net of allowance) of EUR 3,832 million (2021: EUR 3,559 million), accounts receivable other of EUR 228 million (2021: EUR 188 million) and accounts receivable from investments in associates of EUR 55 million (2021: EUR 40 million).",

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Where the company repurchases the company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental transaction costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from shareholders' equity until such treasury shares are cancelled or reissued.\n\nWhere such treasury shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in shareholders' equity.\n\nCall options on own shares are treated as equity instruments.\n\nDividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved by shareholders. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\n## Common shares\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, authorized common shares consist of 2 billion shares (December 31, 2021: 2 billion; December 31, 2020: 2 billion) and the issued and fully paid share capital consists of 889,315,082 common shares, each share having a par value of EUR 0.20 (December 31, 2021: 883,898,969; December 31, 2020: 911,053,001).\n\n## Preference shares\n\nAs a means to protect the company against (an attempt at) an unsolicited takeover or other attempt to exert (de facto) control of the company, the 'Stichting Preferente Aandelen Philips' has been granted the right to acquire preference shares in the company. As of December 31, 2022, no such right has been exercised and no preference shares have been issued. Authorized preference shares consist of 2 billion shares as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 2 billion; December 31, 2020: 2 billion).\n\n## Options, restricted and performance shares\n\nUnder its share-based compensation plans, the company granted stock options on its common shares up to 2013 and other conditional rights to receive common shares in the future such as restricted shares and performance shares (refer to Share-based compensation, starting on page 207).",

Treasury shares are recorded at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date. When treasury shares are delivered by the company under its share-based compensation plans, such shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\n\nWhen treasury shares are delivered by the company upon exercise of options (granted to employees up to 2013), the difference between the cost and the cash received is recorded in retained earnings. When treasury shares are delivered by the company upon vesting of restricted shares or performance shares (granted under the company's share-based compensation plans), the difference between the market price of the shares and the cost is recorded in retained earnings, and the market price is recorded in capital in excess of par value.\n\nThe following table shows the movements in the outstanding number of shares over the last three years:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Outstanding number of shares\n\n|                             | 2020        | 2021         | 2022        |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Balance as of January 1     | 890,973,790 | 905,128,293  | 870,182,445 |\n| Dividend distributed        | 18,080,198  | 6,345,968    | 14,174,568  |\n| Purchase of treasury shares | (8,669,622) | (45,486,392) | (5,080,693) |\n| Delivery of treasury shares | 4,695,170   | 4,194,577    | 2,204,207   |\n| Issuance of new shares      | 48,757      |              |             |\n| Balance as of December 31   | 905,128,293 | 870,182,445  | 881,480,527 |\n\n## The following table reflects transactions that took place in relation to former and current share-based compensation plans:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Transactions related to share-based compensation plans\n\n|                                       | 2020            | 2021            | 2022            |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Shares acquired                       | 5,351,411       | 3,996,576       | 2,142,445       |\n| Average market price                  | EUR 33.81       | EUR 36.15       | EUR 31.76       |\n| Amount paid                           | EUR 181 million | EUR 144 million | EUR 68 million  |\n| Shares delivered                      | 4,695,170       | 4,194,577       | 2,204,207       |\n| Average price (FIFO)                  | EUR 34.35       | EUR 34.14       | EUR 35.16       |\n| Cost of delivered shares              | EUR 161 million | EUR 143 million | EUR 77 million  |\n| Total shares in treasury at year- end | 5,924,708       | 5,726,708       | 5,664,946       |\n| Total cost                            | EUR 199 million | EUR 201 million | EUR 191 million |\n\nThe following transactions took place for capital reduction purposes:\n\n## Transactions related to capital reduction Philips Group\n\n|                                          | 2020            | 2021              | 2022            |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Shares acquired                          | 3,318,211       | 41,489,816        | 2,938,248       |\n| Average market price                     | EUR 39.21       | EUR 36.22         | EUR 36.61       |\n| Amount paid                              | EUR 130 million | EUR 1,503 million | EUR 108 million |\n| Cancellation of treasury shares (shares) | 3,809,675       | 33,500,000        | 8,758,455       |\n| Cancellation of treasury shares (EUR)    | EUR 152 million | EUR 1,216 million | EUR 299 million |\n| Total shares in treasury at year- end    |                 | 7,989,816         | 2,169,609       |\n| Total cost                               |                 | EUR 287 million   | EUR 83 million  |\n\nShare purchase transactions related to employee option and share plans, as well as transactions related to the reduction of share capital, involved a cash outflow of EUR 187 million.

Such limitations relate to common shares of EUR 178 million, as well as to legal reserves required by Dutch law included under retained earnings of EUR 1,010 million and unrealized currency translation differences of EUR 1,866 million. The unrealized loss related to cash flow hedges of EUR 2 million and unrealized loss related to fair value through OCI financial assets of EUR 376 million qualify as revaluation reserves and reduce the distributable amount due to the fact that these reserves are negative.\n\nThe legal reserves required by Dutch law of EUR 1,010 million included under retained earnings relates to any legal or economic restrictions on the ability of affiliated companies to transfer funds to the parent company in the form of dividends.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, these limitations in distributable amounts were EUR 1,947 million and related to common shares of EUR 177 million, as well as to legal reserves required by Dutch law included under retained earnings of EUR 654 million and unrealized currency translation differences of EUR 1,117 million.

The definition of this non-IFRS measure and a reconciliation to the IFRS measure is included below.\n\nNet debt is defined as the sum of long and short-term debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Group equity is defined as the sum of shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests. This measure is used by Philips Treasury management and investment analysts to evaluate financial strength and funding requirements. The Philips net debt position is managed with the intention of retaining the current strong investment grade credit rating. Furthermore, Philips' aim when managing the net debt position is dividend stability and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders (reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, Net income, is provided at the end of this note).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Composition of net debt and group equity in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                                 | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Long-term debt                  | 5,705  | 6,473  | 7,270  |\n| Short-term debt                 | 1,229  | 506    | 931    |\n| Total debt                      | 6,934  | 6,980  | 8,201  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 3,226  | 2,303  | 1,172  |\n| Net debt                        | 3,708  | 4,676  | 7,028  |\n| Shareholders' equity            | 11,870 | 14,438 | 13,249 |\n| Non-controlling interests       | 31     | 36     | 34     |\n| Group equity                    | 11,901 | 14,475 | 13,283 |\n| Net debt and group equity ratio | 24:76  | 24:76  | 35:65  |",

Subsequently, debt is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Debt is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.\n\nPhilips has a USD 2.5 billion Commercial Paper Program and a EUR 1 billion committed standby revolving credit facility that can be used for general group purposes, such as a backstop of its Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2022, Philips did not have any loans outstanding under either facility. These facilities do not have a material adverse change clause, have no financial covenants and no credit-rating-related acceleration possibilities. Philips issued commercial paper of EUR 200 million in September 2022 and EUR 101 million in October 2022, that was repaid throughout the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, Philips secured a EUR 1 billion credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2022 that can be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, Philips had EUR 500 million outstanding under the credit facility. The facility does not have a material adverse change clause, has no financial covenants and no credit-rating-related acceleration possibilities. As per March 9, 2020, Philips established a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program, a framework that facilitates the issuance of notes for a total amount up to EUR 10 billion.

If the company would experience such an event with respect to a series of corporate bonds the company might be required to offer to purchase the bonds that are still outstanding at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Furthermore, the conditions applicable to the EUR-denominated corporate bonds issued in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2022 (due 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030 and 2033) contain a similar provision ('Change of Control Put Event').

This increase was mainly driven by financial market conditions across various countries globally.\n\n## Provisions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, the company has a present legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time (accretion) is recognized as interest expense.\n\n## Restructuring-related provisions\n\nProvisions for severance and termination benefits are recognized for those costs only when the company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation with those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Before a provision is established, the company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with the restructuring.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nBy their nature, the recognition of provisions require estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of outflow of resources. The main estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7 Respironics field-action provision - the provision requires management to make estimates and assumptions about items such as quantities and the portion of products to be remediated through replacement or repair.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The provision for contingent consideration can change significantly due to changes in the estimated achievement of milestones and changes in discount rates. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liability are reflected in other business income (expenses).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Provisions in millions of EUR\n\n|                                     | 2021      | 2021       | 2021   | 2022      | 2022        | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n|                                     | long-term | short-term | total  | long-term | short- term | total  |\n| Post-employment benefits 1)         | 659       |            | 659    | 546       |             | 546    |\n| Respironics field-action provision  | 52        | 525        | 577    | 23        | 366         | 390    |\n| Product warranty provisions         | 32        | 207        | 238    | 57        | 287         | 344    |\n| Environmental provisions            | 99        | 26         | 124    | 83        | 20          | 104    |\n| Restructuring-related provisions    | 8         | 58         | 66     | 6         | 134         | 140    |\n| Legal provisions                    | 53        | 39         | 91     | 14        | 74          | 89     |\n| Contingent consideration provisions | 156       | 52         | 208    | 89        | 23          | 113    |\n| Other provisions                    | 257       | 92         | 349    | 279       | 112         | 390    |\n| Provisions                          | 1,315     | 998        | 2,313  | 1,097     | 1,018       | 2,115  |\n\n## Respironics field action provision\n\nOn June 14, 2021, Philips' subsidiary, Philips Respironics initiated a voluntary recall notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for certain sleep and respiratory care products related to the polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound abatement foam in these devices.\n\nThe repair and replacement program is under way globally. Because of the prioritization of the repair and replace program, Philips is currently not taking new orders for sleep therapy systems, while masks and other consumables continue to be sold. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of the production required for the delivery of replacement devices to patients has been completed. The time to complete the program is impacted by the dependency on supply of materials, including from China, and global logistics capacity. Philips Respironics is also conducting a test and research program with independent laboratories.\n\nPhilips has recognized a provision based on Philips' best estimate of the costs to repair or replace devices subject to the Respironics field action. The provision is related to the cost to repair and/or replace affected devices and includes, amongst others, the costs for the remaining production, the cost of intensified communication with physicians and patients, material costs, labor cost and logistics. The provision does not include any product liability costs or other claims. Movements during the year were as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Respironics field-action provision in millions of EUR\n\n|                           | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1   | -      | 577    |\n| Additions                 | 719    | 250    |\n| Utilizations              | (175)  | (486)  |\n| Translation differences   | 33     | 49     |\n| Balance as of December 31 | 577    | 390    |\n\nAdditions for the year reflect updated expectations in relation to the volume of devices eligible for remediation as well as additional costs related to the acceleration of the program. As of December 31, 2022, Philips Respironics expects to remediate a total of around 5.6 million devices (specific CPAP, BiPAP and mechanical ventilator devices) globally, excluding certain end-of-life devices that are expected to be retired. In 2022, following Philips Respironics' comprehensive patient and customer communication outreach and based on current insights, the total expected units to be remediated have increased by approximately 0.4 million, primarily in the US. Furthermore, efforts to accelerate the program resulted in a shift towards replacement, which increased the replacement share to 60% (compared to 46% as of December 31, 2021) and as a result further reduced repair",

Utilizations for the year reflect the costs incurred in executing the repair and replace program during the year.\n\nThe completion of the field action continues to be subject to significant uncertainties, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about items such as quantities and the portion to be replaced or repaired. As of December 31, 2022, the impact of changes in these main assumptions and estimates, holding other assumptions constant, on the field action provision are as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Main assumptions in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                                     | Increase (decrease) in provision      | Increase (decrease) in provision      |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Assumption                          | Increase individual assumption by 10% | Decrease individual assumption by 10% |\n| Total quantity of devices remaining | 26                                    | (26)                                  |\n| Replacement share                   | 12                                    | (12)                                  |\n\nActual outcomes in future periods may differ from these estimates and affect the company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, running remediation costs of EUR 210 million (2021: EUR 94 million) related to the remediation, such as testing, external advisory and regulatory response and additional right-of-return and warranty provisions have been incurred.\n\nFollowing the FDA's inspection of certain of Philips Respironics' facilities in the US in 2021 and the subsequent inspectional observations, the US Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the FDA, in July 2022 started discussions with Philips regarding the terms of a consent decree to resolve the identified issues. At the end of December 2022, the discussions are ongoing. Furthermore, Philips is a defendant in a number of consumer class action lawsuits from users of the affected devices and a number of individual personal injury and other compensation claims. To date no provisions have been recorded for the litigation and investigations associated with the Respironics field action. For legal matters including claims refer to Contingencies, starting on page 204.\n\n## Product warranty provisions\n\nThe provisions for assurance-type product warranty reflect the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by the company with respect to products sold, and include costs to execute field change orders. The field action provision in connection with the Philips Respironics voluntary recall notification is shown separately above.\n\n## The company expects the provisions to be utilized mainly within the next year.\n\n## Philips Group\n\nProvisions for assurance-type product warranty in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                              | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1                                      | 167    | 238    |\n| Additions                                                    | 364    | 320    |\n| Utilizations                                                 | (265)  | (224)  |\n| Transfer to liabilities associated with assets held for sale | (37)   |        |\n| Translation differences and other                            | 10     | 9      |\n| Balance as of December 31                                    | 238    | 344    |\n\nAdditions in 2022 include quality actions of EUR 108 million in the Connected Care segment, mainly for the following matters:\n\n## Pads Cartridges\n\nIn February 2022, Philips issued a field safety notice notifying customers of a potential issue with the Adult SMART Pads Cartridge (M5071A) and the Infant/Child SMART Pads Cartridge (M5072A) for use specifically with the HeartStart HS1 Automated External Defibrillator (AED) devices. Philips has identified that for affected pads the HS1 AED could deliver less effective or ineffective therapy. Philips is actively working on replacing these pads and has commenced the replacement program in 2022.\n\n## V60 35V\n\nIn March 2022, Philips Respironics issued a voluntary recall notification/field safety notice to customers of its V60, V60 Plus and V680 ventilators, regarding a potential issue that could affect the main electrical circuit ('35V Rail') powering the ventilator and alarm. This notification was updated in April 2022 with additional customer instructions. In June 2022, Philips issued a further update to this notification, regarding the projected correction for this matter. To address the issue with the 35V Rail, Philips Respironics has commenced the remediation program in 2022.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe environmental provisions include accrued costs recorded with respect to environmental remediation in various countries. In the United States, subsidiaries of the company have been named as potentially responsible parties in state and federal proceedings for the cleanup of certain sites.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates.",

The resulting release was EUR 55 million of which EUR 33 million is recorded in continuing operations and EUR 22 million in discontinued operations.\n\n## Restructuring-related provisions\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Restructuring-related provisions in millions of EUR\n\n|                 | January 1,   | 2022 additions   | utilizations   | releases   | other changes   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Diagnosis &     | 26           | 58               | (27)           | (8)        | 0               | 49                  |\n| Treatment       |              |                  |                |            |                 |                     |\n| Connected Care  | 17           | 34               | (13)           | (3)        | (1)             | 34                  |\n| Personal Health | 9            | 9                | (7)            | (2)        | 0               | 10                  |\n| Other           | 14           | 52               | (14)           | (5)        | 0               | 47                  |\n| Philips Group   | 66           | 154              | (61)           | (18)       | (1)             | 140                 |\n\nIn 2022, Philips initiated general productivity actions aimed at simplifying the organization to streamline the way of working and reduce operating expenses. This includes an immediate reduction of around 4,000 positions globally across the organization, subject to\n\nconsultation with the relevant workers councils and social partners, with severance and termination-related costs expected to be approximately EUR 130 million in aggregate, of which EUR 80 million was recorded in 2022.\n\nIn addition, restructuring projects were executed during the year, of which the most significant impacted Diagnosis & Treatment and Other and mainly took place in the US and Netherlands. The restructuring mainly comprised product portfolio rationalization and the reorganization of global support functions. The company expects the provisions to be utilized mainly within the next year.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the most significant restructuring projects impacted Diagnostic & Treatment and Connected Care businesses and mainly took place in the Netherlands and US.\n\nThe movements in the provisions for restructuring in 2021 are presented by segment as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Restructuring-related provisions in millions of EUR\n\n|                       |   January 1, 2021 |   additions | utilizations   | releases   | other changes   |   December 31, 2021 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |                33 |          23 | (19)           | (13)       | 1               |                  26 |\n| Connected Care        |                17 |          16 | (12)           | (4)        | -               |                  17 |\n| Personal Health       |                28 |           6 | (21)           | (6)        | 2               |                   9 |\n| Other                 |                38 |          10 | (21)           | (16)       | 4               |                  14 |\n| Philips Group         |               117 |          55 | (73)           | (39)       | 6               |                  66 |\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nThe company and certain of its group companies and former group companies are involved as a party in legal proceedings, including regulatory and other governmental proceedings.\n\n## Legal provisions in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1           | 72     | 91     |\n| Additions                         | 43     | 89     |\n| Acquisitions                      | 38     | 4      |\n| Utilizations                      | (17)   | (100)  |\n| Releases                          | (48)   | (3)    |\n| Accretion                         | 1      | -      |\n| Translation differences and other | 3      | 7      |\n| Balance as of December 31         | 91     | 89     |",

The provision for contingent consideration can change significantly due to changes in the estimated achievement of milestones and changes in discount rates. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liability are reflected in other business income.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the fair value changes mainly related to EPD. In 2022, the decrease of EUR 61 million in the fair value of the contingent consideration comprised of EUR 30 million due to the revisions to EPD's forecast due to more severe short-term impacts of COVID-19 and the competitive environment, and EUR 31 million due to delays in achievement of certain milestones. In 2021, the decrease of EUR 67 million in the fair value of the contingent consideration comprised of EUR 41 million due to the revisions to EPD's forecast due to more severe short-term impacts of COVID-19 and the competitive environment, and EUR 26 million due to delays in achievement of certain milestones.\n\nThe company expects the provisions to be utilized mainly within the next three years.\n\n## Other provisions\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Other provisions in millions of EUR\n\n|                                   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1           | 372    | 349    |\n| Additions                         | 89     | 160    |\n| Utilizations                      | (87)   | (95)   |\n| Releases                          | (29)   | (35)   |\n| Accretion                         | (5)    | (3)    |\n| Translation differences and other | 9      | 14     |\n| Balance as of December 31         | 349    | 390    |\n\nThe main elements of other provisions are:\n\n- \u00b7 provisions for employee jubilee funds EUR 83 million (2021: EUR 94 million);\n- \u00b7 self-insurance provisions of EUR 57 million (2021: EUR 43 million);\n- \u00b7 provisions for non-income taxes/social security of EUR 46 million (2021: EUR 37 million);\n- \u00b7 provisions for rights of return of EUR 36 million (2021: EUR 40 million);\n- \u00b7 provisions for decommissioning costs of EUR 33 million (2021: EUR 33 million);\n- \u00b7 provisions for onerous contracts of EUR 38 million (2021: EUR 12 million), reflecting noncancellable commitments on supplies for which no future demand or alternative usage has been identified, primarily caused by volatility in demand due to COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 the remaining provisions relate to a variety of positions, for example provision for disability of employees and provision for royalty obligations.\n- \u00b7 the releases in 2021 and 2022 are due to the reassessment of the positions in other provisions throughout the year.\n\nThe company expects the provisions to be utilized mainly within the next five years, except for:\n\n- \u00b7 provisions for employee jubilee funds of which half is expected to be utilized after five years;\n- \u00b7 provisions for decommissioning costs of which half is expected to be utilized after five years;\n- \u00b7 provisions for rights of return to be utilized mainly within the next year.",

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in the Consolidated statements of income in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\n## Defined Benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive after retirement. That pension benefit typically depends on several factors such as years of service, age and salary.\n\nThe net pension asset or liability recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets in respect of defined benefit plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the projected defined benefit obligation at the Consolidated balance sheets date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Recognized assets are limited to the present value of any reductions in future contributions or any future refunds. The net pension liability is presented as a long-term provision; no distinction is made for the short-term portion.\n\nFor the company's major plans, a full discount rate curve of high-quality corporate bonds is used to determine the defined benefit obligation, where available. The curves are based on the Mercer Yield Curve methodology, which uses data of corporate bonds rated AA or equivalent. For the other plans the Mercer Yield Curve/Mercer Methodology has also been used taking into account the cash flows as much as possible in case there is a deep market in corporate bonds. For plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market, the discount rate is based on government bonds and the plan's maturity.\n\nPension costs in respect of defined benefit plans primarily represent the increase of the actuarial present value of the obligation for post-employment benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on the net recognized asset or liability in respect of employee service in previous years.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest). The company recognizes all remeasurements in Other comprehensive income.\n\nPast service costs arising from the introduction of a change to the benefit payable under a plan or a significant reduction of the number of employees covered by a plan (curtailment) are recognized in full in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. The company recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the company's shareholders after certain adjustments.\n\nThe company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nFurther information on other employee benefits can be found in Provisions, starting on page 193 in the Other provisions section.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nTo make the actuarial calculations for the valuation of defined benefit obligations, assumptions are needed for interest rates, healthcare cost increases, future pension increases, life expectancy and employee turnover rates. The actuarial calculations are made by external actuaries based on inputs from observable market data, such as corporate bond returns and yield curves to determine the discount rates to apply, mortality tables to determine life expectancy and inflation rates to determine future salary and pension growth assumptions.\n\nEmployee post-employment benefit plans have been established in many countries in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and the local practice in the countries involved. The larger part of post-employment benefits are company pension plans, of which some are funded and some are unfunded. All funded post-employment benefit plans are considered to be related parties.\n\nMost employees that take part in a company pension plan are covered by defined contribution (DC) pension plans. The main DC plans are in the Netherlands and the United States. The company also sponsors a number of defined benefit (DB) pension plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels.",

The plans are open for future pension accrual. Indexation is mandatory due to legal requirements. Some of the German plans have a DC design, but are accounted for as DB plans due to a legal minimum return requirement.\n\nCompany pension commitments in Germany are partly protected against employer bankruptcy via the 'Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein' which charges a fee to all German companies providing pension promises.\n\nPhilips is one of the sponsors of Philips Pensionskasse VVaG in Germany, which is a multiemployer plan. The plan is classified and accounted for as a DC plan.\n\n## The United States\n\nThe US DB pension plans are closed plans without future pension accrual. For the funding of any deficit in the US plan the Group adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.\n\nThe assets of the US funded pension plans are in Trusts governed by fiduciaries. The nonqualified pension plans that cover accrual above the maximum salary of the funded qualified plan are unfunded.",

The fee is also dependent on the amount of unfunded vested liabilities.\n\n## Risks related to DB plans\n\nDB plans expose the company to various demographic and economic risks such as longevity risk, investment risks, currency and interest rate risk and in some cases inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase but more importantly in some countries where indexation of pensions is mandatory.\n\nThe company has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its DB plans. Liability-driven investment strategies, lump sum cash-out options, buy-ins, buy-outs and a change to DC are examples of the strategy.\n\n## Investment policy in the largest pension plans\n\nPension fund trustees are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets. The plan assets of the Philips pension plans are invested in well diversified portfolios. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio is closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities for most of the plans. Any contributions from the sponsoring company are used to further increase the fixed income part of the assets. As part of the investment strategy, any improvement in the funded ratio over time is used to further decrease the interest rate mismatch between the plan assets and the pension liabilities.\n\n## Summary of pre-tax costs for post-employment benefits and reconciliations\n\nThe adjacent table contains the total of current and past service costs, administration costs and settlement results as included in Income from operations and the interest cost as included in Financial expenses.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Pre-tax costs for post-employment benefits in millions of EUR\n\n|                                       |   2020 |   2021 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Defined benefit plans                 |     74 |     36 | 50     |\n| - included in income from operations  |     59 |     28 | 39     |\n| - included in financial expense       |     13 |      8 | 10     |\n| - included in Discontinued operations |      1 |      1 |        |\n| Defined contribution plans            |    366 |    375 | 400    |\n| - included in income from operations  |    358 |    368 | 400    |\n| - included in Discontinued operations |      8 |      7 |        |\n| Post-employment benefits costs        |    440 |    411 | 449    |\n\n## Summary of the reconciliations for the DBO and plan assets\n\nThe adjacent tables contain the reconciliations for the DBO and plan assets.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Defined benefit obligations in millions of EUR\n\n|                                    | 2021   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1            | 2,153  | 1,970  |\n| Service cost                       | 36     | 32     |\n| Interest cost                      | 33     | 36     |\n| Employee contributions             | 7      | 4      |\n| Actuarial (gains) / losses         |        |        |\n| - demographic assumptions          | 3      | 2      |\n| - financial assumptions            | (86)   | (366)  |\n| - experience adjustment            | (6)    | 12     |\n| (Negative) past service cost       | (5)    | 16     |\n| Settlements                        | (90)   |        |\n| Benefits paid from plan            | (95)   | (95)   |\n| Benefits paid directly by employer | (33)   | (41)   |\n| Translation differences and other  | 52     | 52     |\n| Balance as of December 31          | 1,970  | 1,621  |\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Plan assets in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                 | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1                         | 1,403  | 1,380  |\n| Interest income on plan assets                  | 25     | 26     |\n| Admin expenses paid                             | (1)    | (1)    |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income | 44     | (254)  |\n| Employee contributions                          | 7      | 4      |\n| Employer contributions                          | 33     | 17     |\n| Settlements                                     | (86)   | 0      |\n| Benefits paid from plan                         | (96)   | (95)   |\n| Translation differences and other               | 50     | 45     |\n| Balance as of December 31                       | 1,380  | 1,122  |\n\nThe past service cost in 2022 mainly relates to the retiree medical plans in Brazil.

The DBO was recalculated using a change in the assumptions of 1% which overall is considered a reasonably possible change. The impact on the DBO because of changes in discount rate is normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\nThe average duration of the DBO of the DB plans is 8 years (Germany: 9, United States: 8, and Other countries: 8) as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 11 years).\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                       |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)    | (196)  | (122)  |\n| Pension increase (1% movement) | 99     | 57     |\n| Salary increase (1% movement)  | 19     | 12     |\n| Longevity 1)                   | 48     | 32     |\n| Decrease                       |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)    | 241    | 145    |\n| Pension increase (1% movement) | (83)   | (49)   |\n| Salary increase (1% movement)  | (18)   | (11)   |\n\n## Cash flows and costs in 2023\n\nCash outflows in relation to post-employment benefits are estimated to amount to EUR 464 million in 2023, consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 EUR 19 million employer contributions to funded DB plans (Germany: EUR 7 million, United States: EUR 0 million, Other Countries: EUR 12 million);\n- \u00b7 EUR 43 million cash outflows in relation to unfunded DB plans (Germany: EUR 20 million, United States: EUR 11 million, Other Countries: EUR 12 million); and\n- \u00b7 EUR 402 million employer contributions to DC plans (Netherlands: EUR 186 million, United States: EUR 153 million, Other Countries: EUR 63 million).\n\nThe service and administration cost for 2023 is expected to amount to EUR 29 million for DB plans. The net interest cost for 2023 for the DB plans is expected to amount to EUR 21 million. The cost for DC pension plans in 2023 is equal to the expected DC cash flow.",

Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the company performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).\n\n## Other non-current liabilities\n\nNon-current liabilities were EUR 60 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 56 million).\n\nNon-current liabilities are associated mainly with indemnification and non-current accruals.\n\n## Other current liabilities\n\nOther current liabilities are summarized as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\nOther current liabilities in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                |   2021 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Accrued customer rebates                       |    280 |    213 |\n| Other taxes including social security premiums |    190 |    115 |\n| Other liabilities                              |    116 |    120 |\n| Other current liabilities                      |    587 |    448 |\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nNon-current contract liabilities were EUR 515 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 446 million) and current contract liabilities were EUR 1,696 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 1,491 million).\n\nThe current contract liabilities increased by EUR 205 million, which is mainly driven by an increase in deferred balances for customer service contracts.\n\nThe current contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 resulted in revenue recognized of EUR 1,491 million in 2022.",

Bank overdrafts are included in borrowings in current liabilities.\n\n## Cash flow statements\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows related to interest and tax are included in operating activities. Assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination are included in investing activities (net of cash acquired). Dividends paid to shareholders are included in financing activities. Dividends received are included in operating activities.\n\nCash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are translated into the company's functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified as investing cash flows.\n\n## Cash paid for leases\n\nIn 2022, gross lease payments of EUR 316 million (2021: EUR 308 million; 2020: EUR 325 million) included interest of EUR 25 million (2021: EUR 25 million; 2020: EUR 29 million).\n\n## Net cash used for derivatives and current financial assets\n\nIn 2022, a total of EUR 72 million cash was paid with respect to foreign exchange derivative contracts related to activities for liquidity management (2021: EUR 48 million inflow; 2020: EUR 13 million outflow).\n\n## Purchase and proceeds from non-current financial assets\n\nIn 2022, the net cash outflow is EUR 38 million.\n\nIn 2021, the net cash flow is EUR 0 million.\n\nIn 2020, the net cash outflow of EUR 66 million was mainly the cash outflow due to investment in DC Health amounting to EUR 45 million in China.\n\n## Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities\n\nCertain items in the statements of cash flows do not correspond to the differences between the balance sheet amounts for the respective items, principally because of the effects of translation differences and consolidation changes.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities in millions of EUR\n\n|                            | Balance as of December 31, 2021   | Cash flow   | Currency effects and consolidation changes   | Other 1)   | Balance as of December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Long term debt 2)          | 6,933                             | 1,045       | 107                                          | 27         | 8,111                             |\n| EUR bonds                  | 3,233                             | 827         |                                              |            | 4,061                             |\n| USD bonds                  | 1,313                             | (20)        | 85                                           |            | 1,378                             |\n| Leases                     | 1,220                             | (260)       | 17                                           | 105        | 1,082                             |\n| Forward contracts 3)       | 934                               |             |                                              | (76)       | 858                               |\n| Bank borrowings            | 203                               | 498         | 4                                            |            | 705                               |\n| Other long-term debt       | 30                                | (1)         | 1                                            | (1)        | 28                                |\n| Short term debt 2)         | 47                                | 47          | (6)                                          | 1          | 89                                |\n| Short-term bank borrowings | 47                                | 47          | (6)                                          | 1          | 89                                |\n| Other short-term loans     |                                   |             |                                              |            |                                   |\n| Forward contracts 3)       |                                   |             |                                              |            |                                   |\n| Equity                     | (1,410)                           | (593)       |                                              | 869        | (1,133)                           |\n| Dividend payable           |                                   | (418)       |                                              | 418        |                                   |\n| Forward contracts 3)       | (934)                             |             |                                              | 76         | (858)                             |\n| Treasury shares            | (476)                             | (174)       |                                              | 375        | (275)                             |\n| Total                      |                                   | 500         |                                              |            |                                   |",

Contingencies are not recognized in the balance sheet because they are dependent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the company or because the risk of loss is estimated to be possible but not probable or because the amount cannot be measured reliably. Pursuant to IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, certain information is not disclosed for legal proceedings for which the company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nPhilips' policy is to provide guarantees and other letters of support only in writing. Philips does not stand by other forms of support. The company recognizes a liability at the fair value of the obligation at the inception of a financial guarantee contract. The guarantee is subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of the obligation or the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the likelihood of a potential outflow of resources. In addition, judgment is involved in determining whether the amount of an obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingencies involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, governmental actions, tax and environmental remediation.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the company had no material contingent assets.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe total fair value of guarantees recognized on the balance sheet amounts to EUR nil million for both 2022 and 2021. Remaining off-balance-sheet business related guarantees on behalf of third parties and associates to EUR 2 million in 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 2 million).",

Under these laws, the company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to remediate the effects of certain manufacturing activities on the environment.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe company and certain of its group companies and former group companies are involved as a party in legal proceedings, regulatory and other governmental proceedings, including discussions on potential remedial actions, relating to such matters as competition issues, commercial transactions, product liability, participations, and environmental pollution.\n\nWhile it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of all pending or threatened legal proceedings, regulatory and governmental proceedings, the company is of the opinion that the cases described below may have, or have had in the recent past, a significant impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Public Investigations\n\nThe company is engaged in discussions with, and has provided information to, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and US Department of Justice (DoJ) regarding alleged tender irregularities in the medical device industry in certain jurisdictions. These interactions are primarily focused on a number of compliance findings that the company is addressing in Brazil, China and Bulgaria. In connection with these discussions and their status, the company recorded a provision in the amount of EUR 60 million.\n\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the nature of the relevant events and obligations, Philips is not currently able to reliably estimate the full financial effect of a range of possible outcomes in connection with the abovementioned discussions with the SEC and DoJ beyond the recorded provision. The outcomes of these matters could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Respironics field action\n\nOn June 14, 2021, Philips' subsidiary Philips RS North America LLC (Philips Respironics) issued a voluntary recall notification in the United States and field safety notice outside the United States for specific Philips Respironics CPAP, Bi-Level PAP, and mechanical ventilator devices (the 'Recalled Devices').\n\n## Consent decree\n\nOn August 26, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commenced an inspection of the Philips Respironics manufacturing facility in Murrysville, Pennsylvania and provided Philips Respironics with its preliminary inspectional observations on November 9, 2021. Philips Respironics responded to the FDA's inspectional observations in December 2021,\n\nwhich described the actions already taken by the company, as well as additional planned actions. Philips Respironics is also providing periodic updates to the FDA on its progress for the planned actions. In July 2022, Philips started discussions with the DoJ acting on behalf of the FDA on a consent decree that would address compliance requirements for future sales, the resolution of the inspectional findings and the completion of the recall. At the end of December 2022, the discussions are ongoing.\n\n## DoJ investigation\n\nOn April 8, 2022, Philips Respironics and certain of Philips' subsidiaries in the US received a subpoena from the US DoJ to provide information related to events leading to the Respironics recall. The relevant subsidiaries are cooperating with the investigation. The criminal and civil investigation is being conducted by the US DoJ's Consumer Protection Branch and Civil Fraud Section, and the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Given the early stages of the investigation, the company is not able to reliably estimate the financial impact, if any.\n\n## Product liability claims\n\nFollowing the voluntary recall notification, a number of civil complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions against Philips Respironics and certain of its affiliates (including the company) generally alleging economic loss, personal injury and/or the potential for personal injury allegedly caused by devices subject to the recall.\n\nIn the United States, consumer and commercial class action lawsuits have been filed alleging economic loss and medical monitoring claims. Individual personal injury lawsuits have also been filed. On October 8, 2021, a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania was formed, and most of these class action and personal injury lawsuits have been consolidated in the MDL for pre-trial proceedings. As of December 31, 2022, plaintiffs have filed a consolidated economic loss class action complaint on behalf of device users, hospitals, and insurers and other third-party payers, a consolidated medical monitoring class action complaint on behalf of device users, and over 300 individual personal injury complaints. The company anticipates that the number of individual personal injury complaints will increase in 2023.\n\nIn September 2022, the MDL court established a voluntary, court-approved census registry, and associated tolling, for potential claimants who have not filed claims, but may file claims in the future, relating to the Recalled Devices. The census registry replaces the private tolling agreement that had been in effect before the establishment of the census registry. At the time of termination, approximately 60,000 individuals had entered into the private tolling agreement. In the event these individuals wish to pursue or preserve their claims, they will need to file a lawsuit or register on the census registry. By December 31, 2022, approximately 13,500 individuals had joined the census registry. The company anticipates that the number of individuals on the census registry will increase in 2023.",

In the course of 2022, the plaintiff in the case has sought leave of the court to discontinue the class action citing that there is insufficient evidence to warrant the continuation of the class action and that since the issue of proceedings, Philips Respironics has been repairing, replacing, or refunding the devices which are the subject of the recall, meaning that any compensation relating to financial loss would be relatively confined. It is expected that the case will be discontinued in the first half of 2023.\n\nPhilips Respironics and certain of its affiliates (including the company) are also defendants in consumer class action lawsuits in Canada and Israel and collective actions in Chile, France and the Netherlands alleging economic loss and/or personal injury.\n\nWhile the company believes it is probable that these lawsuits will in the aggregate lead to an outflow of economic resources for Philips Respironics or other Philips entities, given the significant uncertainty regarding the nature of the relevant events and potential obligations, the company is not currently able to reliably estimate the amount of the obligation associated with these various lawsuits. The final outcome of the lawsuits and the cost to resolve them cannot currently be determined due to a number of variables, including uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of claimants and their allegations. Moreover, Philips Respironics has not yet completed its test and research program for all of the categories of the Recalled Devices.\n\nFor the United States specifically, the relative early stage of the census registry, and lack of clarity around the nature of the specific injury each claimant is claiming, contribute to the uncertainty. In addition, the MDL court has not yet decided several significant motions, including motions to dismiss all of the complaints, and plaintiffs have not yet filed their motions for class certification in the economic loss and medical monitoring actions. Further, discovery is still in its early stages, and expert discovery has not yet begun. Moreover, Philips Respironics has not yet completed its test and research program for all of the categories of the Recalled Devices. An adverse outcome with respect to any or all of these lawsuits and/or any future claims could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Securities claims\n\nOn August 16, 2021, a securities class action complaint was filed against the company, its former CEO and its CFO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 causing damage to investors. On January 3, 2022, the lead plaintiff in the case filed its amended complaint seeking to represent individuals that purchased Philips shares between February 23, 2016, through November 12, 2021. Following the filing and briefing of the company's motion to dismiss in the first half of 2022, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on November 30, 2022, in\n\nwhich the alleged damage period was expanded to include certain share price declines that were allegedly based on disclosures made in 2022. The second amended complaint now focuses on share price declines that allegedly occurred as a result of various disclosures starting on April 26, 2021 through October 2022. The company's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is due in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nOn September 11, 2022, the company received a letter from shareholders representative organization European Investors-VEB (\"VEB\"). The VEB holds Philips and its (former) managing and supervisory directors liable for - inter alia - allegedly failing to timely disclose price-sensitive information to shareholders regarding indications of potential (severe) health risks from the use of Recalled Devices, failing to exercise proper oversight over Philips Respironics and implement and ensure a proper information and risk management structure; providing incorrect or incomplete information in the company's financial disclosures.\n\nIt is the company's assessment that it is possible but not probable that these cases could lead to a certain outflow of economic resources. The company is not able to reliably estimate the financial impact, if any. An adverse outcome of these cases could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Other claims\n\nOn October 12, 2021, SoClean, a company offering ozone-based cleaning products for sleep devices, filed a lawsuit against the company and certain of its affiliates alleging that the defendants' statements about the potential adverse effect ozone cleaning may have on the recalled devices has significantly damaged its business. Philips believes that the claim is without merit and will vigorously defend itself. Motions to dismiss the case were filed in November and December 2022.\n\nIn addition, some of Philips Respironics' business partners such as distributors and durable medical equipment providers have filed or threatened to file claims alleging economic losses suffered as a consequence of the voluntary recall. In particular, Philips Respironics is engaging with certain of its business partners on the level of compensation they allege to be entitled to under Philips Respironics' replacement program of the Recalled Devices.\n\nIt is the company's assessment that it is possible but not probable that these cases could lead to a certain outflow of economic resources. The company is not able to reliably estimate the financial impact, if any. In the event of an adverse outcome, these matters could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nTo date no provisions have been recorded for the litigation and investigations associated with the Respironics field action.",

In addition to that, as part of its S&RC operations in the US, Philips Medical Capital LLC funded durable medical equipment (DMEs) providers, through loans and leases. PMC-funded transactions these DMEs entered into with Philips amount to EUR 117 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 162 million; 2020: EUR 242 million). The associated costs of these funding transactions are borne by the ultimate customer and settled directly with Philips Medical Capital LLC.\n\nPhilips Medical Capital LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, is owned 60% by De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. (DLL) and 40% by Philips Electronics North America Corporation (Philips).\n\nIn light of the composition of the Executive Committee, the company considers the members of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board to be the key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.\n\nFor remuneration details of the Executive Committee, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board see Information on remuneration, starting on page 211.\n\nFor Post-employment benefit plans see Post-employment benefits, starting on page 198.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nPhilips share-based compensation is an equity-settled plan comprising restricted and performance shares. The restricted shares are subject to a three-year service condition and the performance shares include both market and non-market-based performance conditions, in addition to a three-year vesting period. These shares are awarded to the Executive Committee and Senior Management.\n\nThe grant date fair value of market-based performance shares is determined through a Monte Carlo valuation model. The grant date fair value of non-market-based performance shares and restricted shares is determined as the share price at the grant date as participants are eligible to receive dividends throughout the vesting period. The costs of share-based compensation plans are revised for expected performance (non-market-based performance shares) and forfeiture and are spread evenly over the service period.\n\nShare-based compensation is recognized over the vesting period as personnel expense in the consolidated statement of income, with a corresponding increase to equity.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe use of a valuation model to determine market-based performance share fair value requires estimates for the expected volatility of the Philips share price and correlation among input variables.\n\nAt each reporting date, Philips calculates the expected realization the of non-market-based performance targets and revises the expected share-based compensation expense. The cumulative effect is recorded in the consolidated statement of income with a corresponding adjustment in equity.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met.\n\nThe purpose of the share-based compensation plans is to align the interests of management with those of shareholders by providing incentives to improve the company's performance on a long-term basis, thereby increasing shareholder value.",

Performance shares as well as restricted shares can be granted to executives, certain selected employees and new employees. Prior to 2013 options were also granted.\n\nUnder the terms of employee stock purchase plans established by the company in various countries, employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Philips shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.\n\nShare-based compensation costs were EUR 104 million (2021: EUR 115 million; 2020: EUR 119 million). This includes the employee stock purchase plan of EUR 9 million, which is not a share-based compensation that affects equity . In the Consolidated statements of changes in equity EUR 95 million is recognized in 2022 and represent the costs of the share-based compensation plans. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted for forfeiture. USDdenominated performance shares, restricted shares and options are granted to employees in the United States only.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nThe performance is measured over a three-year performance period. The performance shares granted in 2019 have two performance conditions, relative Total Shareholders' Return ('TSR') compared to a peer group of 20 companies including Philips (2021: 20 companies; 2020: 20 companies, 2019; 20 companies) and adjusted Earnings Per Share growth **) ('EPS'). For performance shares granted in 2020 onwards, an additional non-financial criterion was added around sustainability. The introduction of the sustainability criterion reflects a further alignment of the remuneration package for the Board of Management with Philips' mission, vision and aim to act as a responsible member of society. The criterion is based on three Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') as defined by the United Nations that are included in Philips' strategy on sustainability (refer to Environment, Social and Governance, starting on page 45).\n\nThe performance shares vest three years after the grant date. The number of performance shares that will vest is dependent on achieving the performance conditions provided that the grantee is still employed with the company. For the performance shares with a grant date in 2019 the two financial conditions, TSR and EPS, are equally weighted, while for the performance shares with a grant date in 2020, 2021, and 2022 the TSR is weighted 50%, EPS 40% and SDG 10%.\n\nThe amount recognized as an expense is adjusted for actual performance of adjusted EPS growth **) and the actual realization of the SDGs since these are non-market performance conditions. It is not adjusted for non-vesting or extra vesting of performance shares due to a relative TSR performance that differs from the performance anticipated at the grant date, since this is a market-based performance condition.\n\nThe fair value of the performance shares is measured based on Monte-Carlo simulation, which takes into account dividend payments between the grant date and the vesting date by including reinvested dividends as well as the market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for the 2022 grants:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk-free rate: 0.43%\n- \u00b7 Expected share price volatility: 32%\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Management's expectation of future developments for other purposes. The company has based its volatility assumptions on historical experience measured over a tenyear period.",

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by the company upon maturity or disposal. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInstruments included in level 1 are comprised primarily of listed equity investments classified as financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss or carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives or convertible bond instruments) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data,\n\nthe instrument is included in level 2. The fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. The valuation of convertible bond instruments uses observable market quoted data for the options and present value calculations using observable yield curves for the fair value of the bonds.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, such as third-party pricing information without adjustments, the instrument is included in level 3.\n\nThe fair value of debt is estimated on the basis of the quoted market prices for certain issuances, or on the basis of discounted cash flow analysis using market rates plus Philips' spread for the particular tenors of the borrowing arrangement. Accrued interest is not included within the carrying amount or estimated fair value of debt.\n\nThe fair value of contingent consideration is dependent on the terms of the respective acquisition agreement that may require Philips to pay additional consideration to former shareholders if specified future events occur or conditions are met, such as the achievement of certain regulatory milestones or the achievement of certain commercial milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration provision is generally determined using a probability-weighted and a risk-adjusted approach to estimate the achievement of future regulatory and commercial milestones, respectively. The discount rates used in the risk adjusted approach reflect the inherent risk related to achieving the commercial milestones. Both regulatory and commercial milestones are discounted for the time value of money at risk-free rates. The fair value measurement is based on management's estimates and assumptions and hence classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",

All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date and classified as current or non-current assets or liabilities based on the maturity date or the early termination date. The company measures all derivative financial instruments at fair value that is derived from the market prices of the instruments, calculated on the basis of the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates, or derived from option pricing models, as appropriate. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income, except for derivatives that are highly effective and qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting.\n\nChanges in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts attributable to forward points and changes in the time value of the option contracts are deferred in the cash flow hedges reserve within equity. The deferred amounts are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income against the related hedged transaction when it occurs.\n\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in OCI until the Consolidated statements of income are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.",

When it is established that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is expected that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in OCI are recognized immediately in the same line item as they relate to in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nForeign currency differences arising upon retranslation of financial instruments designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized directly in the currency translation differences reserve through OCI, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFinancial assets are subject to impairment assessment, which involves estimating expected credit losses. Refer to Other financial assets, starting on page 184 for accounting policies on impairment of financial assets.\n\nPhilips is exposed to several types of financial risks which are further analyzed below. Philips does not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Information regarding financial instruments is included in Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 214.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk for the group is monitored through the Treasury liquidity committee, which tracks the development of the actual cash flow position for the group and uses input from a number of sources in order to forecast the overall liquidity position on both a short and longer term basis. Philips invests surplus cash in short-term deposits with appropriate maturities to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet liabilities when due and in money market funds.\n\nThe rating of the company's debt by major rating agencies may improve or deteriorate. As a result, Philips' future borrowing capacity may be influenced and its financing costs may fluctuate. Philips has various sources to mitigate the liquidity risk for the group. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2022, Philips had EUR 1,172 million in cash and cash equivalents (2021: EUR 2,303 million), within which short-term deposits of EUR 482 million (2021: EUR 1,357 million). Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances, money market funds and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Philips pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for the company's operational or investment needs.\n\nPhilips faces cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a few countries that could limit its ability to make these balances available on short notice for general use by the group.\n\nPhilips has a USD 2.5 billion Commercial Paper Program and a EUR 1 billion committed standby revolving credit facility that can be used for general group purposes, such as a backstop for its Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2022, Philips did not have any loans outstanding under either facility. These facilities do not have a material adverse change clause, have no financial covenants and no credit-rating-related acceleration possibilities. Philips issued commercial paper of EUR 200 million in September 2022 and EUR 101 million in October 2022, that was repaid throughout the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, Philips secured a EUR 1 billion credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2022 that can be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, Philips had EUR 500 million outstanding under the credit facility. The facility does not have a material adverse change clause, has no financial covenants and no credit-rating-related acceleration possibilities. As per March 9, 2020, Philips established a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program, a framework that facilitates the issuance of notes for a total amount up to EUR 10 billion. In 2022, Philips issued three new tranches under the program for a total of EUR 2 billion, while also redeeming its outstanding 2023 and 2024 Notes and issuing a tender offer on the outstanding 2025 and 2026 Notes. For a description of Philips' credit facilities, refer to Debt, starting on page 191.\n\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2022, Philips also held EUR 32 million of listed (level 1) equity investments at fair value (classified as other non-current financial assets).\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the Group's fixed contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022. These amounts are an estimate of future payments which could change as a result of various factors such as a change in interest rates, foreign exchange, contractual provisions, as well as changes in business strategy and needs. Therefore, the actual payments made in future periods may vary from those presented in the following table:",

As of December 31, 2022 capital contributions already made to these investment funds are recorded as non-current financial assets.\n\nPhilips offers voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to factor their trade receivables at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. Philips continues to recognize these liabilities as trade payables and settles them accordingly on the invoice maturity date based on the terms and conditions these arrangements. As of December 31, 2022 approximately EUR 151 million (2021: EUR 139 million)of the Philips account payable were transferred under these arrangements.\n\nWith respect to the Respironics field action, please refer to Contingencies, starting on page 204. The management continues to monitor the risks associated with such potential claims and its impact on liquidity position, if any.\n\n## Leasing activities\n\nThe company leases various items of real estate, vehicles and other equipment where it acts as a lessee. The company has multiple extension and termination options in a number of lease contracts. These are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the company's operations. The options considered reasonably certain are part of lease liabilities. However, the options not considered reasonably certain are not part of\n\nlease liability, which exposes the company to potential future cash outflows amounting to EUR 400 million. In addition, the company is committed to leases not yet commenced to EUR 93 million. The company's lease contracts do not contain financial covenants.\n\nThe company enters into sale-and-leaseback transactions primarily for its Sleep & Respiratory Care businesses. These transactions are accounted for at market value. The payments for these leases are considered in determining lease liabilities. Principal repayments are part of cash flows used for financing activities and interest payments are part of cash flows used for operating activities. The cash inflows arising from the sales transactions are part of cash flows provided by financing activities. Lease payments under sale-and-leaseback arrangements for 2022 were EUR 72 million (2021: EUR 85 million). The remaining minimum payment under sale-and-leaseback arrangements included in lease obligations above are as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\nRemaining minimum payments under sale-and-leaseback arrangements in millions of EUR\n\n| 2023       |   55 |\n|------------|------|\n| 2024       |   38 |\n| 2025       |   23 |\n| 2026       |   14 |\n| 2027       |    5 |\n| Thereafter |   18 |\n\nPhilips has leasing activities where it acts as lessor. In such arrangements, Philips provides the customer with a right to use of medical equipment in exchange for a series of payments. Residual values of assets under lease form an insignificant part of the carrying amount of those assets. Residual values are influenced by asset market prices and are therefore subject to management estimation. Residual values are at least reassessed on an annual basis, or more often when necessary. Reassessments are based on a combination of realization of assets sold, expert knowledge and judgment of local markets. For lease receivables, the value of unguaranteed residual values as of December 31, 2022 was EUR 0.6 million (2021: EUR 0.2 million). In order to reduce residual value risk exposures there may be residual value guarantees or purchase options embedded in the customer contract. Credit risk for lease receivables is reviewed regularly and mitigated, for example, by retaining a security interest in the leased asset.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Philips operates in many countries and currencies and therefore currency fluctuations may impact Philips' financial results. Philips is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:",

In general, net anticipated exposures for the Group are hedged during a period of 15 months in layers of 20% up to a maximum hedge of 80%. Philips' policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Philips from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\nThe following table outlines the estimated nominal value in millions of EUR for committed and anticipated transaction exposure and related hedges for Philips' most significant currency exposures consolidated as of December 31, 2022:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Estimated transaction exposure and related hedges in millions of EUR\n\n|                                 | Sales/Receivables   | Sales/Receivables   | Purchases/Payable   | Purchases/Payable   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                 | exposure            | hedges              | exposure            | hedges              |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022 |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Exposure currency               |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| USD                             | 1,754               | (1,530)             | (979)               | 936                 |\n| JPY                             | 479                 | (289)               | (9)                 | 9                   |\n| GBP                             | 303                 | (188)               | (7)                 | 7                   |\n| CNY                             | 346                 | (259)               | (80)                | 79                  |\n| CAD                             | 203                 | (138)               |                     |                     |\n| PLN                             | 65                  | (62)                |                     |                     |\n| AUD                             | 139                 | (92)                | (1)                 | 1                   |\n| CHF                             | 132                 | (56)                | (3)                 | 2                   |\n| CZK                             | 48                  | (50)                |                     |                     |\n| SEK                             | 55                  | (17)                | (1)                 | 1                   |\n| RUB                             | 192                 | (192)               | (129)               | 129                 |\n| Others                          | 64                  | (46)                | (259)               | 162                 |\n| Total 2022                      | 3,779               | (2,920)             | (1,468)             | 1,326               |\n| Total 2021                      | 5,131               | (3,363)             | (1,559)             | 1,322               |\n\nPhilips uses foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, as well as zero cost collars in hedging the exposure. The derivatives related to transactions are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/ payable and forecasted sales and purchases. Changes in the value of on-balance-sheet foreign-currency accounts receivable/payable, as well as the changes in the fair value of the hedges related to these exposures, are reported in the income statement under costs of sales. The RUB as shown in the table above was hedged for part of the year till Q2 2022. Hedges related to forecasted transactions, where hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The results from such hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income within equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. As of December 31, 2022, a loss of EUR 2 million was deferred in equity as a result of these hedges (2021: EUR 25 million loss). The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2023 at the time when the related hedged transactions affect the income statement. During 2022, EUR 1 million (2021: EUR nil million net gain) was recorded in the consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges. Ineffectiveness arises when anticipated exposures are no longer expected to be highly probable. During 2022, a loss of EUR 42 million included in the cash flow hedges reserve in equity pertaining to changes in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts attributable to forward points and changes in the time value of option contracts was released to income statement.",

The estimated impact of a 10% increase of value of the EUR is estimated to be EUR 114 million. The following table contains an overview of the instantaneous 10% increase in the value of EUR against major currencies.\n\nPhilips Group\n\nEstimated impact of 10% increase of value of the EUR on the fair value of hedges in millions of EUR\n\n|     |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----|--------|--------|\n| USD |     78 |     68 |\n| JPY |     13 |     15 |\n| GBP |     14 |     16 |\n| CHF |      5 |      4 |\n| PLN |      3 |      2 |\n| RUB |     10 |      0 |\n\nThe EUR 114 million increase includes a gain of EUR 41 million that would impact the income statement, which would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining gain of EUR 73 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises as a result of inter-company loans and deposits. Where the company enters into such arrangements, the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary entity. The currency of the company's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries, either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits, or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. In certain cases where group companies may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged through the use of foreign exchange derivatives. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to this exposure are recognized within financial income and expenses in the statements of income. When such loans would be considered part of the net investment in the subsidiary, net investment hedging would be applied.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. If a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Net current-period change, before tax, of the currency translation reserve of EUR 748 million mainly relates to the development of the USD versus the EUR. As of December 31, 2022, a weakening of USD by 10% versus the EUR would result in a decrease in the currency translation reserve in equity of approximately EUR 1,132 million, while a strengthening of USD by 10% versus the EUR would result in an increase in the currency translation reserve in equity of approximately EUR 1,384 million. Refer to the country risk paragraph for countries with significant foreign currency denominated equity invested.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, cross-currency interest rate swaps for a nominal value of USD 500 million (liability at fair value: EUR 147 million) and external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 1,490 million (liability at book value: EUR 1,378 million) were designated as net investment hedges of financing investments in foreign operations for an equal amount. During 2022 a total loss of EUR 1.1 million was recognized in the income statement as ineffectiveness on net investment hedges, arising from counterparty and own credit risk.\n\nThe total net fair value of financing derivatives as of December 31, 2022, was a liability of EUR 147 million. An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR 192 million in the value of the derivatives, including a EUR 191 million increase related to the USD.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cross-currency interest rate swaps for a nominal value of USD 500 million (liability at fair value: EUR 116 million) and external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 1,473 million (liability at book value: EUR 1,313 million) were designated as net investment hedges of financing investments in foreign operations for an equal amount. During 2021 a total gain of EUR 1.1 million was recognized in the income statement as ineffectiveness on net investment hedges, arising from counterparty and own credit risk.\n\nThe total net fair value of financing derivatives as of December 31, 2021, was a liability of EUR 116 million. An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR 40 million in the value of the derivatives, including a EUR 40 million increase related to the USD.\n\nPhilips does not currently hedge the foreign exchange exposure arising from equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and other non-current financial assets.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, Philips had outstanding debt of EUR 8,201 million (2021: EUR 6,980 million), which constitutes an inherent interest rate risk with potential negative impact on financial results. At year-end, Philips held EUR 1,172 million in cash and cash equivalents (2021: EUR 2,303 million), and had total long-term debt of EUR 7,270 million (2021: EUR 6,473 million) and total short-term debt of EUR 931 million (2021: EUR 506 million). As of December 31, 2022, Philips had a ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 80% compared to 90% one year earlier. Philips debt has a long maturity profile with an average tenor of longterm debt of 6.1 years with maturities up to 2042.\n\nThe following table provides the impact of a 1% increase/decrease of interest rates on the fair value of the debt and the annualized net interest expenses.",

The market has transitioned to alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs) that are transaction-based. LIBOR has been discontinued for most currencies and maturities after December 31, 2021, except for the US-dollar for which certain maturities are expected to be phased out in 2023. The company has no interest rate hedging relationships which get affected by the reform and does not expect any significant impact on existing contracts due to change in the interest rates. The company implemented new alternative risk-free rates from January 1, 2022 and the impact upon transition was EUR 1 million financial expense.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in equity prices.\n\nPhilips is a shareholder in some publicly listed companies and as a result is exposed to potential financial loss through movements in their share prices. The aggregate equity price exposure in such financial assets amounted to approximately EUR 32 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 67 million). Philips does not hold derivatives in the above-mentioned listed companies. Philips also has shareholdings in several privately-owned companies amounting to EUR 229 million, mainly consisting of minority stakes in companies in various industries. As a result, Philips is exposed to potential value adjustments.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n\nPhilips is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy. Philips may hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, Philips did not have any significant outstanding financial commodity derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Philips trade receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Philips performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and nonfinancial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, pre-payments and pledges on assets.\n\nPhilips invests available cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Philips is also exposed to credit risks in the event of non-performance by financial institutions with respect to financial derivative instruments. Philips actively manages concentration risk and on a daily basis measures the potential loss under certain stress scenarios, should a financial institution default. These worst-case scenario losses are monitored and limited by the company.\n\nThe company does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions. However, where possible the company requires all financial institutions with which it deals in derivative transactions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to have a strong credit rating. Philips also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties. Wherever possible, cash is invested and financial transactions are concluded with financial institutions with strong credit ratings or with governments or government-backed institutions.\n\nThe following table shows the number of financial institutions with credit rating A- and above with which Philips has cash at hand and short-term deposits above EUR 10 million as of December 31, 2022.",

The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable. The country risk is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the company had country risk exposure of EUR 14.0 billion in the United States, EUR 1.3 billion in China (including Hong Kong). Other countries higher than EUR 500 million are Germany EUR 808 million, United Kingdom EUR 766 million, and Japan EUR 639 million. Other country which have significant exposure is Singapore EUR 206 million. The degree of risk of a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. The company does not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk.\n\nThe impact of hyperinflation is also routinely assessed and was not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Other insurable risks\n\nPhilips is insured for a broad range of losses by global insurance policies in the areas of property damage/ business interruption, general and product liability, transport, directors' and officers' liability, employment practice liability, crime and cybersecurity. The\n\ncounterparty risk related to the insurance companies participating in the above-mentioned global insurance policies is actively managed. As a rule, Philips only selects insurance companies with a financial strength of at least A-. Throughout the year the counterparty risk is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nTo lower exposures and to avoid potential losses, Philips has a global Risk Engineering program in place. The main focus of this program is on property damage and business interruption risks including company interdependencies. Regular on-site assessments take place at Philips locations and business-critical suppliers by risk engineers of the insurer in order to provide an accurate assessment of the potential loss and its impact. The results of these assessments are shared across the company's stakeholders. On-site assessments are carried out against the predefined Risk Engineering standards, which are agreed between Philips and the insurers. Recommendations are made in a Risk Improvement report and are monitored centrally. This is the basis for decision-making by the local management of the business as to which recommendations will be implemented.\n\nFor all policies, deductibles are in place, which vary from EUR 0.3 million to EUR 10 million per occurrence and this variance is designed to differentiate between the existing risk categories within Philips. Above a first layer of working deductibles, Philips operates its own re-insurance captive, which during 2022 retained EUR 25 million per claim and EUR 50 million in the annual aggregate for general, product, professional liability, and marine cargo claims.\n\nNew contracts were signed effective December 31, 2022, for the coming year, whereby the re-insurance captive retentions remained the same.\n\n## Subsequent events 30\n\nOn January 30, 2023, Philips announced plans to create value with sustainable impact, which is based on focused organic growth to deliver patient- and people-driven innovation at scale with improved execution as key value driver, prioritizing patient safety and quality, supply chain reliability and a simplified operating model. In addition to the reduction of its workforce by 4,000 roles announced in October 2022, Philips plans to reduce its workforce by an additional 6,000 roles globally by 2025, of which 3,000 will be implemented in 2023 in line with the relevant local regulations and processes. These reductions are focused on Corporate and Functions optimization and non-core activities, for which charges in 2023 are expected to be approximately EUR 470 million.",

Financial income related to intercompany financing transactions decreased mainly due to a reduction of intercompany loans in the US at the end of 2021. Financial income related to Other financial assets decreased mainly due to the value adjustment through P&L of investment in limited life funds. For further information, refer to Other financial assets, starting on page 233.\n\nFinancial expense mainly relates to interest paid on external debt of EUR 188 million (2021: EUR 120 million) and the value adjustments related to Other financial assets of EUR 44 million (2021: EUR 46 million). Financial expense related to interest paid on external debt increased mainly due to an increase in external loans.\n\n## Income taxes E\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. is the lead legal entity of the fiscal unity that exists for Dutch corporate income tax purposes and reports the income tax expense of the fiscal unity.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2022 deviates compared to the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25.8%, mainly due to due to non-deductible expenses, expenses relating to uncertain tax treatments and withholding tax costs, partly offset by exempted results relating to participations and recurring favorable tax incentives. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflected in Others represents mainly the effect of the inclusion of income of other legal entities that are part of the fiscal unity contributing to the fiscal unity income tax expense.",

For further details on derivative instruments, refer to note Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 214 and Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 218\n\n## Commitments and contingencies O\n\nThe company has contracts with investment funds where it committed itself to make, under certain conditions, capital contributions to their funds up to an aggregated remaining amount of EUR 90 million (2021: EUR 104 million). As of December 31, 2022, capital contributions already made to these investment funds are recorded as Other non-current financial assets.\n\nGeneral guarantees as referred to in Section 403, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code, have been given by the company on behalf of several group companies in the Netherlands. The liabilities of these companies to third parties and investments in associates totaled EUR 1,247 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 1,316 million). Guarantees totaling EUR 421 million (2021: EUR 491 million) have also been given on behalf of other group companies. As of December 31, 2022 there have been no guarantees given on behalf of unconsolidated companies and third parties (2021: nil).\n\nThe company is the head of a fiscal unity that contains the most significant Dutch whollyowned group companies. The company is therefore jointly and severally liable for the tax liabilities of the tax entity as a whole.\n\nFor additional information, refer to Contingencies, starting on page 204, which is deemed incorporated and repeated herein by reference.",

We consider sales an important metric for the activities of the Company in 2022.                                      |\n|                   | Last year's materiality was based on income before taxes, adjusted for certain non- recurring items. Due to the financial performance of Koninklijke Philips N.V. in 2022 we considered income before taxes, adjusted for certain non-recurring items, no longer to be an appropriate benchmark. |\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 2.75 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the group financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for components. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the components. On this basis, we selected components for which an audit had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nOur group audit primarily focused on significant group entities. Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Koninklijke Philips N.V.'s group financial statements, we have selected 9 components which required an audit of the complete financial information (Full Scope components). Furthermore, we selected 33 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances or specified audit procedures on significant\n\naccounts that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the group financial statements (Specific or Specified Scope components). We performed certain audit procedures centrally, related to financial statement account balances such as capitalized development costs, restructuring costs, Health Systems sales and Personal Health sales running on the primary systems, Field Change Order (FCO) provisions, payroll, acquisitions and goodwill. Furthermore, we were involved in certain component team audit procedures related to tax, legal claims, litigation and contingencies. For the remaining components, we performed selected other procedures, including analytical review and test of details to respond to potential risks of material misstatements to the financial statements that we identified.\n\nAs a result of our scoping of the complete financial information, specific account balances and the performance of audit procedures at different levels in the organization, our actual coverage varies per financial statement account balance and the depth of our audit procedures per account balance varies depending on our risk assessment.\n\nAccordingly, our audit coverage, for selected account balances included in the key audit matters stated below, are summarized as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Respironics field action provision in Audit Coverage %   | Respironics field action provision in Audit Coverage %   | Respironics field action provision in Audit Coverage %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Full scope                                               | 100%                                                     |                                                          |\n| CGU S&RC Goodwill in Audit Coverage %                    | CGU S&RC Goodwill in Audit Coverage %                    | CGU S&RC Goodwill in Audit Coverage %                    |\n| Full scope                                               | 100%                                                     |                                                          |\n| Sales in Audit Coverage %                                | Sales in Audit Coverage %                                | Sales in Audit Coverage %                                |\n| Full scope                                               | 33%                                                      |                                                          |\n| Specific scope                                           | 32%                                                      |                                                          |\n| Specified procedures                                     | 35%                                                      |                                                          |",

In addition, we sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas to be audited and the information required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we attended in-person site visits at component locations in the United States, Germany, India, Japan, Panama and Indonesia. We held a virtual site visit in China given COVID restrictions during the year. These site visits encompassed some, or all, of the following activities: co-developing the significant risk area audit approach, reviewing key local working papers and conclusions, meeting with local and regional management teams and obtaining an understanding of key processes including centralized entity level controls processes. In general, we interacted regularly with the component teams during various stages of the audit through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities. Where deemed appropriate, we attended certain Full and Specific Scope component closing meetings with management, also using video or teleconferencing facilities. We reviewed key working papers of component auditors using the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or by the provision of copies of work papers direct to the group audit team.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at components, together with additional procedures at the central level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion on the group financial statements.\n\n## Teaming, use of specialists and internal audit\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competencies which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the health technology industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury, and income tax and have made use of our own valuation, share-based compensation and actuarial experts.\n\nWe performed our audit in cooperation with internal audit of Koninklijke Philips N.V., leveraging their in-depth knowledge of Koninklijke Philips N.V. and work performed. We agreed on the joint coordination of the audit planning, the nature and scope of the work to be performed, reporting and documentation. We evaluated and tested the relevant work performed by Internal Audit to satisfy ourselves that the work was adequate for our purposes and established what work had to be performed by our own professionals.\n\n## Our focus on climate-related risks\n\nClimate-related risks can impact financial reporting. The Board of Management has summarized Philips' commitments and obligations in relation to climate, and reported in Chapter 5 'Environmental, Social, and Governance' and Chapter 13 'ESG Statements' on the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) how the Company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climaterelated risks and the Company's commitments and (constructive) obligations are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions applied by Koninklijke Philips N.V. Furthermore, we read the management report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial information in Chapter 5 'Environmental, Social, and Governance' and Chapter 13 'ESG Statements' and the financial statements. Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks to have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or significant assumptions as of December 31, 2022 and as such we have not identified a key audit matter.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of Philips and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and the Board of Management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control including how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes.\n\nWe refer to section 6 of the management report for the Board of Management's fraud risk assessment and section 8.3 of the Supervisory Board report, starting on page 107 in which the Audit Committee reflects on this fraud risk assessment.",

We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption, in close co-operation with our forensic and legal specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. For these risks, we have performed procedures, among others, to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in Note 1 General information to the Consolidated financial statements , starting on page 151 to the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, including those with related parties. When identifying and assessing fraud risks, we presumed that there are risks of fraud in sales recognition. We refer to our Key Audit Matter related to Sales recognition sales related accruals and installable sales orders for further information, as to our procedures in this regard.\n\nWe considered available information and made inquiries of relevant executives, directors, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources, regional directors and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe fraud risks we identified, inquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements.\n\nOur audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry\n\nexperience, through discussions with the Board of Management, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports and performing test of controls, substantive tests of details on classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\nGiven the Company is a global organization, operating in multiple jurisdictions, in our assessment of the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, we also considered the potential risk from Philips' interactions with third-party distributors and governmental agencies. We refer to section 6.6 Compliance risks, starting on page 103 in the management report. Our audit approach included the following steps: 1) obtain an understanding of the environment and the Company to enable the detection of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to bribery and corruption, 2) obtain an understanding of the internal control environment and the measures for mitigating those risks (by the Company) in the light of applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations and 3) execute controls-based and substantive audit procedures in order to obtain sufficient evidence for the mitigation of the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to bribery and corruption.\n\nWe also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known or alleged instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\nWe refer to our Key Audit Matter related to the Measurement of provisions and disclosures for legal claims, litigations and contingent liabilities for further information as to our procedures in this regard.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in section 'Basis of preparation' in Note 1 General information to the Consolidated financial statements , starting on page 151 to the financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements the Board of Management made a specific assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for the foreseeable future. We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the Board of Management, exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism.\n\nWe considered whether the Board of Management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.",

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. In comparison with previous year, the nature of our key audit matters did not change.\n\n## Revenue recognition - Sales related accruals and installable sales orders\n\n| Risk               | Primarily in the Personal Health businesses, the Company has sales promotion-related agreements with distributors and retailers whereby discounts and rebates are provided according to the quantity of goods sold and promotional and marketing activities performed by distributors and retailers. The estimation of the sales related accruals involve subjective management assumptions based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding which promotional targets are expected to be met by distributors and retailers. We identified a fraud risk related to the estimation of the sales related accruals through inappropriate estimations. Further reference is made to Note 6, Income from operations, starting on page 162, section Sales composition and disaggregation, as included in the group financial statements.   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Auditing the Company's measurement of sales related accruals is complex because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions around the extent to which promotional or marketing targets will be met by distributors and retailers and the related rebates that will be owed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                    | In addition, the sales in the Diagnosis & Treatment (D&T) and Connected Care (CC) businesses of the Company include the sale of equipment which requires installation and formal acceptance by the customer before control over the goods and services are transferred to the customer and sales can be recognized (installable sales orders). There is a risk of management accelerating sales through override of customer acceptance controls for installable sales orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Our audit approach | Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the appropriateness of the Company's revenue recognition policies for sales promotion-related agreements in accordance with IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and whether the policies have been applied consistently or whether changes, if any, are appropriate in the circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                    | As part of our audit procedures, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to measurement for sales related accruals and the occurrence of sales for installable sales orders. This included testing controls relating to management's verification that sales related accruals have been reviewed and underlying assumptions were based on management's best estimate. We also tested the Company's controls over customers' acceptance of installed equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                    | With respect to the sales related accruals, we evaluated management's assumptions by performing, among other procedures, a retrospective review of actual settlements of prior period sales related accruals, confirmed the agreed upon terms and conditions for a sample of contracts and performed cut off testing through assessing the sales promotions obligations around year-end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                    | Furthermore, with respect to the installable sales orders we have tested, among other procedures, sales transactions before and after period-end for installable sales orders by obtaining formal customer acceptance documentation to evidence occurrence of sales in the appropriate period.

The most significant assumptions used within the model to support the recoverable amount of the CGU S&RC are sales growth rates, EBITA in the terminal value, pre-tax discount rate, and the scope and duration of the consent decree that is currently under discussion. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the appropriateness of the impairment methodology applied by the Company related to the valuation of goodwill in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets' and whether the methodology has been applied consistently or whether changes, if any, are appropriate in the circumstances. We focused specifically on the CGU S&RC considering the                                                                      |\n| approach  | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment review process related to the CGU S&RC. This includes controls over management's review and approval of the significant assumptions, controls over the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and the appropriateness of the valuation models used. For example, we tested controls over management's review and determination of sales growth, EBITA in the terminal value, pre-tax discount rate, and the scope and duration of the consent decree that is currently under discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|           | As part of these procedures, we assessed and tested the assumptions used by management in its valuation model for the CGU S&RC by comparing the assumptions to external data such as industrial sales growth rates and discount rates, and we performed sensitivity analyses over these key assumptions. We were assisted in our evaluation of the discount rate by EY valuation specialists. Further, we corroborated the assumptions of the consent decree that is currently under discussion, including the scope and duration to the underlying legal documentation. Additionally, to test the data used by management, we compared the cash flow projections used in the valuation model of the recoverable amount to the information approved by the Executive Committee and have evaluated the historical accuracy of management's estimates that drive the assessment, such as business plans and expected growth rates. We gained an understanding of the developments of the performance and corroborated if |\n| Key       | they are in line with forecasted figures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|           | We also assessed the adequacy of management's disclosure around goodwill as included in the group financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |",

We corroborated the reasonability of the replacement share and performed procedures over historical accuracy. In our assessment we considered the contracted repair capacity, the upgraded in-house production capacity, and management's internal and external communication. We also performed an analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of the provision. In addition, we inspected the communication with regulatory authorities regarding the identified quality issues and held discussions with management on the recall process, capacity considerations as well as the ongoing cooperation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is drawn up and published in accordance with sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub-section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board renders account of the implementation of the remuneration policy in 2022 in the remuneration report, as prepared by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF\n\n## Engagement\n\nFollowing the appointment by the General Meeting on May 7, 2015, we were engaged by the Supervisory Board as auditor of Koninklijke Philips N.V. on October 22, 2015, as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date. We were reappointed in the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) on May 9, 2019 for a term of three years starting January 1, 2020.",

The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report, prepared in the XHTML format, including the (partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements, as included in the reporting package by Koninklijke Philips N.V., complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Board of Management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of the Company's financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package\n- \u00b7 identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:\n- \u00b7 obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files has been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF\n- \u00b7 examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\n## Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS-EU and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Board of Management is responsible for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board of Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Board of Management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements.

Blenderman\n\n## Reconciliation of non-IFRS information 12.3\n\nIn this Annual Report Philips presents certain financial measures when discussing Philips' performance that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS ('nonIFRS'). These non-IFRS measures (also known as non-GAAP or alternative performance measures) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of Philips' performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which Philips operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. Philips believes that an understanding of its sales performance, profitability, financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following nonIFRS measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable sales growth;\n- \u00b7 EBITA;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted (Adjusted EPS);\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA;\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow;\n- \u00b7 Net debt : group equity ratio; and\n- \u00b7 Organic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\n\nNon-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS and not all companies calculate non-IFRS measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to measures used by other companies that have the same or similar names. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the non-IFRS measures contained in this Annual Report and they should not be considered as substitutes for sales, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other financial measures computed in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThis chapter contains the definitions of the non-IFRS measures used in this Annual Report as well as reconciliations from the most directly comparable IFRS measures. The non-IFRS measures discussed in this Annual Report are cross referenced to this chapter. These nonIFRS measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to equivalent IFRS measures and should be used in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of Philips' business and operations and, accordingly, they have not been audited or reviewed by Philips' external auditors.",

Philips has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of these targets to the most directly comparable IFRS measures because certain information needed to reconcile these non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures are dependent on specific items or impacts which are not yet determined, are subject to uncertainty and variability in timing and amount due to their nature, are outside of Philips' control, or cannot be predicted, including items and impacts such as currency exchange rates, acquisitions and disposals, legal and tax gains and losses and pension settlements, charges and costs such as impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and net capital expenditures. Accordingly, reconciliations of these nonIFRS forward looking financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Such unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nComparable sales growth represents the period-on-period growth in sales excluding the effects of currency movements and changes in consolidation. As indicated in General information to the Consolidated financial statements , starting on page 151, foreign currency sales and costs are translated into Philips' presentation currency, the euro, at the exchange rates prevailing at the respective transaction dates. As a result of significant foreign currency sales and currency movements during the periods presented, the effects of translating foreign currency sales amounts into euros could have a material impact on the comparability of sales between periods. Therefore, these impacts are excluded when presenting comparable sales in euros by translating the foreign currency sales of the previous period and the current period into euros at the same average exchange rates. In addition, the years presented were affected by a number of acquisitions and divestments, as a result of which various activities were consolidated or deconsolidated. The effect of consolidation changes has also been excluded in arriving at the comparable sales. For the purpose of calculating comparable sales, when a previously consolidated entity is sold or control is lost, relevant sales for that entity of the corresponding prior year period are excluded. Similarly, when an entity is acquired and consolidated, relevant sales for that entity of the current year period are excluded.\n\nComparable sales growth is presented for the Philips Group, operating segments and geographic area. Philips' believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is meaningful for investors to evaluate the performance of Philips' business activities over time. Comparable sales growth may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, because comparable sales growth figures are not adjusted for other effects, such as increases or decreases in prices or quantity/volume. In addition, interaction effects between currency movements and changes in consolidation are not taken into account.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Sales growth composition by segment in %\n\n|                       | nominal growth   | consolidation changes   | currency effects   | comparable growth   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| 2022 versus 2021      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 6.2              | 0.0                     | (6.8)              | (0.7)               |\n| Connected Care        | (3.7)            | (0.1)                   | (7.0)              | (10.8)              |\n| Personal Health       | 5.7              | 0.0                     | (5.7)              | 0.1                 |\n| Philips Group         | 3.9              | (0.2)                   | (6.5)              | (2.8)               |\n| 2021 versus 2020      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 5.6              | 0.0                     | 2.5                | 8.1                 |\n| Connected Care        | (17.5)           | (7.2)                   | 2.2                | (22.6)              |\n| Personal Health       | 7.2              | 0.0                     | 1.6                | 8.8                 |\n| Philips Group         | (0.9)            | (2.5)                   | 2.2                | (1.2)               |\n| 2020 versus 2019      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | (3.7)            | (1.0)                   | 2.3                | (2.3)               |\n| Connected Care        | 18.6             | 0.7                     | 2.3                | 21.6                |\n| Personal Health       | (9.0)            | 0.0                     | 2.8                | (6.2)               |\n| Philips Group         | 1.0              | (0.5)                   | 2.4                | 2.9                 |",

EBITA represents Income from operations excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill. Adjusted EBITA represents EBITA excluding gains or losses from restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other items.\n\nRestructuring costs are defined as the estimated costs of initiated reorganizations, the most significant of which have been approved by the Executive Committee, and which generally involve the realignment of certain parts of the industrial and commercial organization.\n\nAcquisition-related charges are defined as costs that are directly triggered by the acquisition of a company, such as transaction costs, purchase accounting related costs and integrationrelated expenses.\n\nOther items are defined as any individual item with an income statement impact (loss or gain) that is deemed by management to be both significant and incidental to normal business activity. This includes the following: litigation costs and settlements in favor of (or against) the company, gains (or losses) on sale of businesses or assets, remediation costs, impairment of assets, portfolio realignment charges, environmental charges and other items which are individually above an amount of EUR 20 million in a quarter, or an individual item which is above EUR 40 million across multiple quarters. Refer to Net income, Income from operations (EBIT) and Adjusted EBITA within the Results of operations, starting on page 30 section of Financial performance, starting on page 26.\n\nPhilips considers the use of Adjusted EBITA appropriate as Philips uses it as a measure of segment performance and as one of its strategic drivers to increase profitability through reallocation of its resources towards opportunities offering more consistent and higher returns. This is done with the aim of making the underlying performance of the businesses more transparent.\n\nEBITA excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets (and impairment of goodwill), which primarily relates to brand names, customer relationships and technology, as Philips believes that such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency, are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and do not factor into its decisions on allocation of its resources across segments. Although we exclude amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets from the Adjusted EBITA measure, Philips believes that it is important for investors to understand that these acquired intangible assets contribute to revenue generation.\n\nPhilips believes Adjusted EBITA is useful to evaluate financial performance on a comparable basis over time by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental items which are not directly related to the operational performance of Philips Group or its segments.\n\nAdjusted EBITA may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on Philips' net income.\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin refers to Adjusted EBITA divided by sales expressed as a percentage.\n\nAdjusted EBITA is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, Net income, for the years indicated is presented in the following table. Net income is not allocated to segments as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.",

Shareholders refers to shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V.\n\nRestructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other items are all defined in the EBITA and Adjusted EBITA section above.\n\nNet finance expenses are defined as either the financial income or expense component of an individual item already identified to be excluded as part of the Adjusted income from continuing operations, fair value movements of equity investments in limited life funds recognized at fair value through profit or loss or a financial income or expense component with an income statement impact (gain or loss) that is deemed by management to be both significant and incidental to normal business activity.\n\nThe adjustments to tax expense include the tax impact of the adjustments to income from continuing operations as well as tax only adjusting items, and uses the Weighted Average Statutory Tax Rate plus any recurring tax costs or benefits.\n\nPhilips considers the use of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders appropriate as Philips uses it as the basis for the Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted, a non-IFRS measure.\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on Philips' net income. Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table. Net income is not allocated to segments as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS. The reconciliation of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table.\n\n## Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted (Adjusted EPS)\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted is calculated by dividing the Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares (after deduction of treasury shares) outstanding during the period, as defined in General information to the Consolidated financial statements , starting on page 151, earnings per share section.\n\nPhilips considers the use of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted appropriate as it is a measure that is useful when comparing its performance to other companies in the HealthTech industry. However, it may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it uses Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders which has certain items excluded.\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure, income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted for the years indicated, is included in the following table.",

Philips considers Adjusted EBITDA useful when comparing its performance to other companies in the HealthTech industry. However, Adjusted EBITDA may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool because of the range of items excluded and their significance in a given reporting period. Furthermore, comparisons with other companies may be complicated due to the absence of a standardized meaning and calculation framework. Philips management compensates for the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement IFRS results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than IFRS results alone. In addition to the limitations noted above, Adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods. This is because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events. Also, the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods and may not be indicative of future results. A reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the following table. Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table. Net income is not allocated to segments as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.",

Net capital expenditures are comprised of the purchase of intangible assets, expenditures on development assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.\n\nPhilips discloses free cash flow as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as Philips believes it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the performance of its business activities over time. Philips understands that free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing its performance. Philips also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash generated by the Philips operations after deducting cash outflows for purchases of intangible assets, capitalization of product development, expenditures on development assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of the business. In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by purchases or sales of businesses and investments, it is generally less volatile than the total of net cash provided by (used for) operating activities and net cash provided by (used for) investing activities.\n\nFree cash flow may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as free cash flow is not a measure of cash generated by operations available exclusively for discretionary expenditures and Philips requires funds in addition to those required for capital expenditures for a wide variety of non-discretionary expenditures, such as payments on outstanding debt, dividend payments or other investing and financing activities. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect cash payments that may be required in future for costs already incurred, such as restructuring costs.\n\n## Composition of free cash flow in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                                          | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net cash flows provided by operating activities          | 2,511  | 1,629  | (173)  |\n| Net capital expenditures:                                | (876)  | (729)  | (788)  |\n| Purchase of intangible assets                            | (114)  | (107)  | (105)  |\n| Expenditures on development assets                       | (296)  | (259)  | (257)  |\n| Capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment    | (485)  | (397)  | (444)  |\n| Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment | 19     | 33     | 18     |\n| Free cash flow                                           | 1,635  | 900    | (961)  |\n\n## Net debt : group equity ratio\n\nNet debt : group equity ratio is presented to express the financial strength of Philips. Net debt is defined as the sum of long- and short-term debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Group equity is defined as the sum of shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests. This measure is used by Philips Treasury management and investment analysts to evaluate financial strength and funding requirements. This measure may be subject to limitations because cash and cash equivalents are used for various purposes, not only debt repayment. The net debt calculation deducts all cash and cash equivalents whereas these items are not necessarily available exclusively for debt repayment at any given time.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Composition of net debt to group equity in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                               | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Long-term debt                | 5,705  | 6,473  | 7,270  |\n| Short-term debt               | 1,229  | 506    | 931    |\n| Total debt                    | 6,934  | 6,980  | 8,201  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 3,226  | 2,303  | 1,172  |\n| Net debt                      | 3,708  | 4,676  | 7,028  |\n| Shareholders' equity          | 11,870 | 14,438 | 13,249 |\n| Non-controlling interests     | 31     | 36     | 34     |\n| Group equity                  | 11,901 | 14,475 | 13,283 |\n| Net debt : group equity ratio | 24:76  | 24:76  | 35:65  |\n\n## Organic Return on Invested Capital\n\nOrganic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is defined as organic return which includes income from operations for the year excluding the impact of: Income or Loss from operations of businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the measurement date; certain tax gains and losses determined by management to be material in nature and require separate disclosure and; certain other items; and tax effects of the other adjustments (calculated at group effective tax rate) divided by average of the Net operating capital at the end of each of the five quarters ending on the relevant measurement date excluding the average net operating capital at the end of each of the five quarters ending on the relevant measurement date of the businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the measurement date, expressed as a percentage.\n\nNet operating capital is defined as tangible fixed assets, intangible fixed assets, including goodwill, inventories and receivable balances, minus payable balances and provisions, all as further defined below. Net operating capital is adjusted to exclude assets and liabilities of businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the relevant measurement date, and adjustments determined by management to be necessary for comparability.",

In the years 2020-2022 these other items included legal provisions, pension settlements, results of divestments, remediation costs, impairment of assets and portfolio realignment charges. Refer to Net income, Income from operations (EBIT) and Adjusted EBITA within the Results of operations, starting on page 30 section of Financial performance, starting on page 26. Organic ROIC is calculated after taxes.\n\nThe term Organic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used by management to evaluate Philips' efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments and how well the company uses capital to generate returns. Philips believes that Organic ROIC provides useful information to investors because it excludes the impact of recently acquired businesses, giving a more accurate representation of how the Philips Business System is leveraged to drive operational excellence and removes irregularity caused by various operating models of recently acquired businesses. Philips also believes that excluding certain items determined by management to be material in nature and requiring separate disclosure enhances comparability across several periods. Organic ROIC may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes Income or Loss from operations of acquired businesses and tax gains and losses and certain other items, which may have a significant effect on ROIC. Organic ROIC is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS.\n\nThe most comparable IFRS measure to Organic ROIC is Return on total assets, calculated as Income from operations for the year divided by total assets as of the end of the year. Return on total assets as of the balance sheet date for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 is included in the following table.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Return on total assets in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                            | 2020   | 2021   | 2022    |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Income from operations     | 1,264  | 553    | (1,529) |\n| Total assets               | 27,713 | 30,961 | 30,688  |\n| Return on total assets (%) | 4.6%   | 1.8%   | (5.0)%  |\n\nThe reconciliation of Average Net operating capital and the reconciliation of Net income to Organic ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are included in the following tables.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Reconciliation of Average Net operating capital 1) in millions of EUR\n\n|                                              | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Tangible fixed assets                        | 2,799   | 2,716   | 2,715   |\n| Intangible assets (including goodwill)       | 11,789  | 13,454  | 14,684  |\n| Inventories                                  | 3,056   | 3,248   | 3,999   |\n| Receivable balances 2)                       | 5,010   | 4,648   | 5,043   |\n| Payable balances 3)                          | (6,520) | (6,627) | (7,129) |\n| Provisions 4)                                | (2,066) | (2,178) | (2,313) |\n| Group Average Net operating capital          | 14,068  | 15,261  | 16,999  |\n| Net operating capital of businesses acquired | (3,176) | (5,511) | (5,739) |\n| Average Net operating capital                | 10,892  | 9,750   | 11,260  |",

Comparative results have been restated to reflect the treatment of the Domestic Appliances business as a discontinued operation (for more information, please refer to Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 156).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Other Key Performance Indicators\n\n|                                                              | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lives improved, in billions                                  | 1.53   | 1.67   | 1.81   |\n| Operational carbon footprint, in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent | 518    | 519    | 438    |\n| Circular revenues                                            | 15%    | 16%    | 18%    |\n| Waste to landfill                                            | 2.6%   | 0.1%   | 0.0%   |\n| Closing the Loop 1)                                          | N/A    | 34%    | 35%    |\n| Comparable order intake                                      | 9%     | 4%     | (3)%   |\n\n## Lives Improved\n\nThe purpose of Philips is to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation and we aim to improve the lives of 2 billion people a year by 2025, including 300 million in underserved communities, rising to 2.5 billion and 400 million respectively by 2030. We use Lives Improved as a measurement of our societal impact. In the course of 2021 we changed the definition of 'lives improved' (effective January 2021) to align more closely with our purpose. The new definition includes only products or solutions that contribute to people's health and well-being, and no longer includes the contribution from our Green Products and Solutions that support a healthy ecosystem. Additionally, as we discontinued our Domestic Appliances business, we have removed the impact of this business from the Lives Improved results. The combined impact of these changes resulted in an overall drop of 223 million lives improved in 2021. We calculate Lives Improved as the number of individual interactions for each product sold (based on market intelligence and statistical data) and multiply by the number of those products delivered in a year (eliminating double counting for multiple different product touches per individual). See Improving people's lives, starting on page 63 for more information on Lives Improved.",

We define Operational Carbon Footprint as the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person; expressed in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent. We calculate our Operational Carbon Footprint on a monthly basis and include industrial sites (manufacturing and assembly sites), non-industrial sites (offices, warehouses, IT centers and R&D facilities), business travel (lease and rental cars and airplane travel) and logistics (air, sea and road transport) See Sustainable Operations, starting on page 56 for more information on our Operational Carbon Footprint.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nAs a company committed to the transition to a circular economy, we aim to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more effectively. We define Circular Revenues as revenues generated through products and solutions that meet specific Circular Economy requirements (including performance and access-based business models, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured products and systems, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured components, upgrades or refurbishment on site or remote, and products with a recycled plastics content of >25% postconsumer recycled plastics or >30% post-industrial/postconsumer recycled plastics by total weight of eligible plastics). We calculate Circular Revenues as annual revenues attributable to products and solutions that meet the Circular Economy requirements.\n\n## Waste to Landfill\n\nAt Philips, as a responsible company, we strive to reduce our environmental impact. We define Waste to Landfill as total waste that is delivered for landfill and exclude one-timeonly waste and waste delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements. We calculate Waste to Landfill in kilotonnes per year. See Sustainable Operations, starting on page 56 for more information on Waste to Landfill.\n\n## Closing the Loop\n\nAt Philips, we are committed to offer a trade-in on all our professional medical equipment and to take care of responsible repurposing of such trade-in systems. We call this 'Closing the Loop'. We calculate Closing the Loop as Process Adherence (%) multiplied by Reclaim (%). Process adherence (%) is defined as the % of won Replacement Philips deals which are associated with a trade in request in our CRM system. Reclaim (%) is defined as the % of won Replacement Philips deals with a customer accepted trade in request in our CRM system and a repurposing strategy that fulfills our reclaim requirements.\n\nPhilips believes that the five other key performance indicators described above (Lives Improved, Operational Carbon Footprint, Circular Revenues, Waste to Landfill and Closing the Loop) provide important information to investors and are important to understanding the long-term performance and prospects of the business. In addition, these other key\n\nperformance indicators are also used for management compensation purposes. Members of the Board of Management are eligible for grants of performance shares under the LongTerm Incentive (LTI) Plan, and the vesting of the performance shares is subject to performance over a period of 3 years and based on certain criteria, including a 10% weighting for Sustainability Objectives, which Philips defines as the five other key performance indicators described above: Lives Improved, Carbon Footprint, Circular Revenues, Waste to Landfill and Closing the Loop. Philips believes that including these other key performance indicators in our remuneration policy encourages management to act responsibly and sustainably, supporting the company's overall performance and enhancing the long-term value of the company. See Remuneration of the Board of Management in 2022, starting on page 119 for more information on the Philips' Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan.\n\n## Comparable order intake\n\nComparable order intake represents the period-on-period growth, expressed as a percentage, in order intake excluding the effects of currency movements and changes in consolidation. Comparable order intake is reported for equipment and software in the Diagnoses & Treatment and Connected Care businesses, and is defined as the total contractually committed value of equipment and software to be delivered within a specified timeframe, and is an approximation of expected future revenue growth in the respective businesses. Comparable order intake does not derive from the financial statements and a quantitative reconciliation is thus not provided.\n\nPhilips has simplified its order intake policy by aligning horizons for all modalities to 18 months to revenue. Order intake for software contracts corresponds to the same 18 months to revenue horizon, meaning that only the next 18 months conversion to revenue under the contract is recognized. Philips believes this policy eliminates major variances in order intake growth and better reflects expected revenue in the short term from order intake booked in the reporting period.\n\nPhilips uses comparable order intake as an indicator of business activity and performance. Comparable order intake is not an alternative to revenue and may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool due to differences in amount and timing between booking orders and revenue recognition. Due to divergence in practice, other companies may calculate this or a similar measure (such as order backlog) differently and therefore comparisons between companies may be complicated.",

Examples of forward-looking statements include statements made about our strategy, estimates of sales growth, future Adjusted EBITA *) , future restructuring and acquisition-related charges and other costs, future developments in Philips' organic business and the completion of acquisitions and divestments. Forward-looking statements can be identified generally as those containing words such as 'anticipates', 'assumes', 'believes', 'estimates', 'expects', 'should', 'will', 'will likely result', 'forecast', 'outlook', 'projects', 'may' or similar expressions. By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances and there are many factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.\n\nThese factors include but are not limited to: Philips' ability to gain leadership in health informatics in response to developments in the health technology industry; Philips' ability to transform its business model to health technology solutions and services; macroeconomic and geopolitical changes; integration of acquisitions and their delivery on business plans and value creation expectations; securing and maintaining Philips' intellectual property rights, and unauthorized use of third-party intellectual property rights; ability to meet expectations with respect to ESG-related matters; failure of products and services to meet quality or security standards, adversely affecting patient safety and customer operations; breach of cybersecurity; challenges in connection with Philips' strategy to improve execution and other business performance initiatives; the resilience of our supply chain; attracting and retaining personnel; COVID-19 and other pandemics; challenges to drive operational excellence and speed in bringing innovations to market; compliance with regulations and standards including quality, product safety and (cyber) security; compliance with business conduct rules and regulations including privacy and upcoming ESG disclosure and due diligence requirements; treasury and financing risks; tax risks; reliability of internal controls, financial reporting and management process; global inflation.\n\nAs a result, Philips' actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set forth in such forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause future results to differ from such forward-looking statements, see also Risk management, starting on page 87.\n\n## Third-party market share data\n\nStatements regarding market share, contained in this document, including those regarding Philips' competitive position, are based on outside sources such as specialized research institutes, industry and dealer panels in combination with management estimates. Where\n\nfull year information regarding 2022 is not yet available to Philips, market share statements may also be based on estimates and projections prepared by management and/or based on outside sources of information. Management's estimates of rankings are based on order intake or sales, depending on the business.\n\n## Use of non-IFRS information\n\nIn presenting and discussing the Philips Group's financial position, operating results and cash flows, management uses certain non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measure and should be used in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures. NonIFRS financial measures do not have standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. A reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures is contained in Reconciliation of non-IFRS information, starting on page 246.\n\n## Fair value information\n\nIn presenting the Philips Group's financial position, fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values are not readily available, fair values are estimated using appropriate valuation models and unobservable inputs. Such fair value estimates require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently uncertain and may therefore deviate from actual developments. Critical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## Statutory financial statements and management report\n\nThe chapters Group financial statements and Company financial statements contain the statutory financial statements of the company. The introduction to the chapter Group financial statements sets out which parts of this Annual Report form the management report within the meaning of Section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code.",

Of the commercialized chemical flame retardants, the brominated variety are most widely used.\n\n## CO 2 -equivalent\n\nCO 2 -equivalent or carbon dioxide equivalent is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gas, the amount of CO 2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), when measured over a specified timescale (generally 100 years).\n\n## Circular economy\n\nA circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more effectively. By definition it is a driver for innovation in the areas of material, component and product reuse, as well as new business models such as solutions and services. In a Circular Economy, the more effective use of materials makes it possible to create more value, both by cost savings and by developing new markets or growing existing ones.\n\n## Circular Material Management\n\nCircular Material Management has replaced the recycling percentage at Philips, as we endeavor to reduce total material use. The Circular Material Management percentage includes circular measures such as waste prevented, reuse and other recovery, but excludes waste delivered to landfill and incineration (with and without energy recovery) due to regulatory requirements.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nCircular Revenues are defined by revenues generated through products and solutions that meet specific Circular Economy requirements. These include performance and access-based business models, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured products and systems, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured components, upgrades or refurbishment on site or remote, and products with a recycled plastics content of >25% post-consumer recycled plastics or >30% post-industrial/post-consumer recycled plastics by total weight of eligible plastics.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nThe dividend yield is the annual dividend payment divided by Philips' market capitalization. All references to dividend yield are as of December 31 of the previous year.\n\n## EcoHeroes\n\nPhilips' 'EcoHeroes' concept aims to drive innovation beyond our EcoDesign requirements, delivering solutions that are demonstrably setting the pace in terms of environmental impact. EcoHeroes outperform the relevant benchmark in at least one of the focal areas; any comparative sustainability claim is underpinned by a quantitative analysis. Our target is to have 25% of total hardware revenue coming from EcoHeroes by 2025.\n\n## Employee Engagement Index (EEI)\n\nThe Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single measure of the overall level of employee engagement at Philips. It is a combination of perceptions and attitudes related to employee satisfaction, commitment and advocacy.\n\n## Energy-using Products (EuP)\n\nAn energy-using product is a product that uses, generates, transfers or measures energy (electricity, gas, fossil fuel). Examples include boilers, computers, televisions, transformers, industrial fans and industrial furnaces.\n\n## Full-time equivalent employee (FTE)\n\nFull-time equivalent is a way to measure a worker's involvement in a project. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to a full-time worker, while an FTE of 0.5 signals that the worker works half-time.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a network-based organization that pioneered the world's most widely used sustainability reporting framework. GRI is committed to the framework's continuous improvement and application worldwide. GRI's core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance.\n\n## Green/EcoDesigned Innovation\n\nGreen/EcoDesigned Innovation comprises all R&D activities directly contributing to the intended development of Green/EcoDesigned Products or Green/EcoDesigned Technologies. Innovation projects are characterized as Green/EcoDesigned based on the innovation brief; this designation is not revised during the project lifetime.\n\n## Green/EcoDesigned Products\n\nGreen/EcoDesigned Products offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more Green Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight, Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. The life cycle approach is used to determine a product's overall environmental improvement. It calculates the environmental impact of a product over its total life cycle (raw materials, manufacturing, product use and disposal). Green/EcoDesigned Products need to prove leadership in at least one Green Focal Area compared to industry standards, which is defined by a segment-specific peer group. This is done either by",

Because of different product portfolios, businesses have specified additional criteria for Green/ EcoDesigned Products, including product specific minimum requirements where relevant.\n\n## Green/EcoDesigned Revenues\n\nGreen/EcoDesigned Revenues are generated through products and solutions which offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more of the Green Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight, Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. Green/EcoDesigned Revenues are determined by classifying the environmental impact of the product or solution over its total life cycle. Philips uses Green/EcoDesigned Revenues as a measure of social and economic performance in addition to its environmental results. The use of this measure may be subject to limitations as it does not have a standardized meaning and similar measures could be determined differently by other companies. A product or solution that has been determined to contribute to Green/EcoDesigned Revenues will continue to do so until it is decommissioned.\n\n## Growth geographies\n\nGrowth geographies are the developing geographies comprising of Asia Pacific (excluding Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand), Latin America, Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East & Turkey (excluding Israel) and Africa.\n\n## Hazardous substances\n\nHazardous substances are generally defined as substances posing imminent and substantial danger to public health and welfare or the environment.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT)\n\nIncome from operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated statement of income. The term EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) has the same meaning as Income from operations.\n\n## Income from continuing operations\n\nIncome from continuing operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated statement of income, which is net income from continuing operations, or net income excluding discontinued operations.\n\n## Large medical equipment\n\nMRI systems, CT scanners, NM systems, DXR equipment, and IGT Fixed systems. This includes all Main Article Groups (MAGs) in the portfolio of these business units, except for the MAGs that represent non-life-extending upgrades: 'T82', 'Q72', 'I66', 'X19', 'Q71', 'W62', 'P10', 'S08', 'S14', 'Q74', 'S47', 'S33', 'Z44', 'S66', 'Q76', 'BI9'.\n\n## Lean\n\nThe basic insight of Lean thinking is that if every person is trained to identify wasted time and effort in their own job and to better work together to improve processes by eliminating such waste, the resulting enterprise will deliver more value at less expense.\n\n## Lives improved by Philips\n\nTo calculate how many lives we are improving, market intelligence and statistical data on the number of people touched by the products contributing to the social or ecological dimension over the lifetime of a product are multiplied by the number of those products delivered in a year. After elimination of double counts - multiple different product touches per individual are only counted once - the number of lives improved by our innovative solutions is calculated.\n\n## Long-term strategic partnership\n\nMulti-year contractual agreement that represents a partnership to enable long-term collaboration.\n\n## Market/Market Group\n\nA Market consists of one or more countries operating as a single organization under a Market Leader. Our 17 Market organizations are organized in three market groups: North America, Greater China and International Markets.\n\n## Mature geographies\n\nMature geographies are the highly developed markets comprising of Western Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\nNet Promoter Score\u00ae, or NPS\u00ae, measures customer experience and predicts business growth. NPS is calculated by taking the answer to a key question on a 0-10 scale: How likely is it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague? Respondents are grouped as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth.\n- \u00b7 Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n- \u00b7 Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage the brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.\n\nSubtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters yields the Net Promoter Score, which can range from a low of -100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to a high of 100 (if every customer is a Promoter).",

Philips' operational carbon footprint is calculated on a monthly basis and includes industrial sites (manufacturing and assembly sites), non-industrial sites (offices, warehouses, IT centers and R&D facilities), business travel (lease and rental cars and airplane travel) and logistics (air, sea and road transport).\n\n## Philips Lighting/Signify\n\nReferences to 'Signify' in this Annual Report relate to Philips' former Lighting segment (prior to deconsolidation as from the end of November 2017 and when reported as discontinued operations), Philips Lighting N.V. (before or after such deconsolidation) or Signify N.V. (after its renaming in May 2018), as the context requires.\n\n## Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)\n\nPolyvinyl chloride, better known as PVC or vinyl, is an inexpensive plastic so versatile it has become completely pervasive in modern society.\n\n## Quadruple Aim\n\nAt Philips, we make value-based care principles actionable by addressing the Quadruple Aim - better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care.\n\n## REACH\n\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is a European Union regulation that addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impact on both human health and the environment.\n\n## Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n\nThe Responsible Business Alliance (formerly known as The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)) was established in 2004 to promote a common code of conduct for the electronics and information and communications technology (ICT) industry. EICC now includes more than 100 global companies and their suppliers.\n\n## Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS)\n\nThe RoHS Directive prohibits all new electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market in the European Economic Area from containing lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, poly-brominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), except in certain specific applications, in concentrations greater than the values decided by the European Commission. These values have been established as 0.01% by weight per homogeneous material for cadmium and 0.1% for the other five substances.\n\n## Solution\n\nA combination of Philips (and 3rd-party) systems, devices, software, consumables and services, configured and delivered in a way to solve customer (segment)-specific needs and challenges.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, water, sanitation, energy, environment and social justice.\n\n## Sustainable Innovation\n\nSustainable Innovation is the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of products and solutions that address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) or 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ). This includes all Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care innovation spend. In addition, innovation spend that contributes to Green Products and healthy living at Personal Health is included. Finally, innovation spend at Other that addresses the SDGs 3 and 1 is included.\n\n## VOC\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. Their high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate or sublimate from the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.\n\n## Voluntary turnover\n\nVoluntary turnover covers all employees who resigned of their own volition.\n\n## Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)\n\nThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) is the European Community directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment setting collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods. The directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers of such equipment.\n\n## Weighted Average Statutory Tax Rate (WASTR)\n\nThe reconciliation of the effective tax rate is based on the applicable statutory tax rate, which is a weighted average of all applicable jurisdictions. This weighted average statutory tax rate (WASTR) is the aggregation of the result before tax multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate without adjustment for losses, divided by the group result before tax.",

We expanded the Environmental Annual Report with the launch of our first Sustainability Annual Report in 2003., This report provided details of our social and economic performance in addition to our environmental results. In 2008, we decided to publish an integrated financial, social and environmental report. This is our 15th annual integrated financial, social and environmental report. For more information, please refer to the company's website.\n\nRoyal Philips publishes its integrated Annual Report with the highest (reasonable) assurance level on the financial, social and environmental performance. With that overall reasonable assurance level, Philips is a front-runner in our industry.\n\n## Tracking trends 13.1.1\n\nWe follow external trends continuously to determine the issues most relevant for our company and where we can make a positive contribution to society at large. In addition to our own research, we make use of a variety of sources, including the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), World Bank, World Economic Forum, IFRS, EFRAG, World Health Organization, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Our work also involves tracking topics of concern to governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), regulatory bodies, academia, and following the resulting media coverage.\n\n## Stakeholders 13.1.2\n\nWe derive significant value from our diverse stakeholders across all our activities and engage with, listen to and learn from them. Working in partnerships is crucial to delivering on our purpose to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation. We incorporate their feedback on specific areas of our business into our planning and actions. In addition, we participate in meetings and task forces as a member of organizations including the World Economic Forum, WBCSD, Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), EFRAG, Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, European Round Table for Industry, Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) and the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals.\n\nFurthermore, we engage with the leading Dutch labor union (FNV) and a number of NGOs, including Enough, GoodElectronics, the Chinese Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, UNICEF, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, WageIndicator and Friends of the Earth, as well as a variety of investors and analysts.\n\nOur sustainability e-mail account (philips.sustainability@philips.com) enables stakeholders to share their issues, comments and questions, also about this Annual Report, with the sustainability team. The following table provides an overview of the different stakeholder groups, examples of those stakeholders and the topics discussed, used for our materiality analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have also included a visualization of our value creation process.\n\nThis integrated annual report has been prepared with reference to the GRI Universal Standards 2021. A detailed overview of the GRI indicators can be found in the GRI content index on our sustainability website. Next, we developed additional company-specific indicators and started to measure the impact we are having on society. The information on definition, scope and measurement can be found in this chapter.\n\nWe signed up to the United Nations Global Compact in March 2007 to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. Our General Business Principles, Human Rights, Sustainability and Environmental Policies, and our Supplier Sustainability Declaration are the cornerstones that enable us to live up to the standards set by the Global Compact. This is closely monitored and reported, as illustrated throughout this report, which is also our annual Communication on Progress (COP) submitted to the UN Global Compact Office.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in January 2017 Philips signed the Compact for Responsive and Responsible Leadership. The Compact is an initiative to promote and align the longterm sustainability of corporations and the long-term goals of society, with an inclusive approach for all stakeholders. In this Annual Report we also included the WEF's International Business Council new ESG framework.\n\nWe use this report to communicate on our progress towards the relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ), SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and SDG 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ). Please refer to Stakeholder engagement, starting on page 293 for more details.\n\n## Material topics and our focus 13.1.4\n\nEvery year, we identify the environmental, social, and governance topics which have the greatest impact on our business and the greatest level of concern to stakeholders along our value chain. Please refer to Materiality analysis, starting on page 13 for more details on this process and the results for 2021. Below you will find an overview of the Key material topics, further references, KPIs and the boundaries of these topics.",

An overview of these commitments has been provided in Philips' ESG commitments, starting on page 50 and more detailed targets can be found in the respective sections.\n\nAll of our programs are guided by the Philips General Business Principles, which provide the framework for all of our business decisions and actions.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## ESG commitment\n\n|                                                               | baseline year 2020         | target 2025                  | 2022 actual                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Environmental                                                 |                            |                              |                            |\n| Green / EcoDesigned revenues                                  | 73.2%                      | 100%                         | 71.7%                      |\n| Circular revenues                                             | 14.6%                      | 25%                          | 18.1%                      |\n| Circular Materials Management                                 | 90%                        | 95%                          | 91%                        |\n| Zero waste to landfill as a percentage of total regular waste | 2.6%                       | less than 0.5%               | 0.0%                       |\n| Net operational carbon footprint                              | 0 KTonnes                  | 0 KTonnes                    | 0 KTonnes                  |\n| % of suppliers committed to Science Based Target              |                            | 50%                          | 41%                        |\n| Social                                                        |                            |                              |                            |\n| Lives Improved                                                | 1.53 billion               | 2 billion                    | 1.81 billion               |\n| Lives improved in underserved communities                     | 127 million                | 300 million                  | 202 million                |\n| Females in leadership positions                               | 27%                        | 35%                          | 30%                        |\n| Total Recordable Case (TRC) rate                              | 0.24                       |                              | 0.23                       |\n| Human Rights impact assessments at our at-risk sites          | 60%                        | 100%                         | 60%                        |\n| Supplier Development Program                                  | 302,000 employees impacted | 1,000,000 employees impacted | 459,000 employees impacted |\n| Governance                                                    |                            |                              |                            |\n| General Business Principles training completion               | 65,000 staff trained       |                              | 62,000 staff trained       |\n\n## Boundaries of ESG reporting 13.1.6\n\nOur ESG performance reporting encompasses the consolidated Philips Group activities in the Environmental, Social and Governance Performance sections, following the consolidation criteria detailed in this section. As a result of impact assessments of our value chain we have identified the material topics, determined their relative impact in the value chain (supply chain, our own operations, and use phase of our products) and reported for each topic on the relevant parts of the value chain. More details are provided in the relevant sections in the ESG Statements.\n\nThe consolidated selected financial information in this ESG statements section has been derived from the Group Financial Statements, which are based on IFRS.\n\nLives improved by the Philips Foundation have been consolidated.\n\n## Comparability and completeness 13.1.7\n\nWe used expert opinions and estimates for some parts of the Key Performance Indicator calculations. There is therefore an inherent uncertainty in our calculations, e.g. Lives Improved, Environmental Profit and Loss account and Social Impact calculations. The figures reported are Philips' best estimate. As our insight increases, we may enhance the methodology in the future.\n\nWe have excluded the data from Domestic Appliances from the E, S and G information wherever possible. In a limited number of cases, for example for road logistics emissions, we have used proxies for previous years. If Domestic Appliances information was not available for past years, and could therefore not be excluded, we have indicated this in the respective section. The EEI and GBP results have not been restated.\n\nIn 2020, Philips has made changes to the EP&L use case scenario, the energy mix of the use phase of its products and added the full Sleep & Respiratory Care portfolio to the EP&L scope. For more information we refer to Environmental performance, starting on page 52 and our methodology document.\n\nIn 2019, Philips re-aligned its 'Lives Improved' target with the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda following the completion of its portfolio transformation. Philips targets an ambitious, average annual Lives Improved growth rate of around 6% for the 2019 - 2030 period.\n\nIn order to report on our corporate scope 2 emissions, Philips follows the Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Guidance. This guidance requires that companies operating in liberalized electricity markets, where renewable energy certificates (also referred to as 'contractual instruments' and 'energy attribute certificates) such as Guarantees of Origin (GO), RECs, etc. are available, shall report two Scope 2 totals based on the following methods; the location-based method and the market-based method. In short, the locationbased method total can only be reduced by decreasing the activity data (or electricity consumption) since the grid average emission factor is largely outside of corporate control and more in control by governments and utilities. By contrast, the market-based method is designed to highlight supply choices, including low-or zero carbon supply from renewable sources like wind or solar. In 2021, the emission factor set for our scope 2 market-based and location-based have been updated. For our market-based scope 2 calculations in Europe and the US, we apply the Reliable Disclosure (RE-DISS) and AIB European Residual Mixes 2019 Version 1.1 (GWP Applied) and 2020 Green-e\u00ae Residual Mix Emissions Rates (2018 Data)",

For our locationbased scope 2 calculations, we apply the US Environmental Protection Agency eGRID (Sub Region & US Average) - 2018 (Released Jan 2020) v1.1 and the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020 v1.1 (AR4 Applied) emission factors.\n\nThe emissions of substances data is based on measurements and estimates at manufacturing site level. The figures reported are Philips' best estimate.\n\nThe integration of newly acquired activities is scheduled according to a defined integration timetable (in principle, the first full reporting year after the year of acquisition) and subject to the integration agenda. Data for activities that are divested during the reporting year are not included in full-year reporting. Environmental data are reported for manufacturing sites with more than 50 industrial employees.\n\n## Scope 13.1.8\n\n## Lives improved\n\nThe Key Performance Indicator on 'lives improved' and the scope are defined in the methodology document that can be found in Methodology for calculating Lives Improved. We used opinions from Philips experts and estimates for some parts of the Lives Improved calculations. Philips has made strong commitments to improve people's health and wellbeing. To track our impact, Philips identifies countries where the need for access to healthcare is highest. This is determined by four selected health indicators, as provided by United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which focuses on health and well-being. The specific methodology for how we determine an underserved health community can be found in the same document.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nHealth and safety data is reported by sites with over 50 FTEs (full-time equivalents) and is voluntary for smaller locations. The data are reported and validated each month via an online centralized IT tool. The Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate is defined as a KPI for workrelated cases where the injured employee is unable to work one or more days, or had medical treatment, or sustained an industrial illness. We also provide the Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC) rate, which measures work-related injuries and illnesses that predominantly occur in manufacturing operations and Field Services Organizations where the incident leads to at least one lost workday. Fatalities are reported for staff, contractors and visitors. The TRC and LWIC KPIs refer to all reported cases.\n\n## General Business Principles\n\nAlleged GBP violations are registered in our web-based reporting and validation tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental data\n\nAll environmental data from manufacturing operations, except process chemicals, are reported on a monthly basis in our sustainability reporting and validation tool, according to company guidelines that include definitions, procedures and calculation methods. Process chemicals are reported on a half-yearly basis.\n\nInternal validation processes have been implemented and peer audits performed to ensure consistent data quality and to assess the robustness of data reporting systems.\n\nThese environmental data from manufacturing are tracked and reported to measure progress against our Sustainable Operations targets.\n\nA manufacturing site is classified as \"Zero Waste to Landfill\" if less than or equal to 0.5% of the total regular waste reported by the site is sent directly to landfill via an external contractor. This excludes waste that is landfilled due to a regulatory requirement and Onetime waste. A site needs to meet these requirements at least two consecutive reporting periods.\n\nReporting on ISO 14001 certification is based on manufacturing units reporting in the sustainability reporting system.\n\n## Environmental Profit & Loss account\n\nThe Philips Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account measures our environmental impact on society at large. The EP&L account is based on Life Cycle Analysis methodology in which the environmental impacts are expressed in monetary terms using specific conversion factors. For more information we refer to our methodology report.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint\n\nPhilips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total operational carbon footprint. As part of our operational carbon footprint, Philips also reports on two scope 3 categories that can be influenced by operational choices, namely our scope 3 emissions from business travel and scope 3 emissions from transportation and distribution.\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 - direct CO 2 e emissions - is reported on in full, covering the direct emissions from all sites that Philips manages. This includes all so-called industrial and non-industrial sites, both leased and owned. Our scope 1 emissions reflect the direct emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion and use of refrigerants on our sites. All direct energy and",

The data for our industrial sites is always reported in full. The direct energy consumption and refrigerant use in non-industrial sites are based on actual data where available. If this is not the case, they are estimated based on average energy usage per square meter, taking the geographical location and building type of the site into account.\n- \u00b7 Scope 2 - indirect CO 2 -e emissions is reported using the market-based method that is designed to highlight supply choices, including low-or zero carbon supply from renewable sources like wind or solar. It includes emissions from purchased heating, cooling and steam. The emission factor used under this method is (where available) the residual-mix emission factor, reflecting only the emissions from fossil-fuel-based electricity production in a country in a given year. For instance, if a corporate like Philips sources renewable electricity globally, the emissions from its electricity consumption will be zero under this method. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. All certificates were obtained through Green-e certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the United States, European Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) of the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) and i-RECs for our ASEAN operations. To ensure additionality, all certificates were generated in 2022 - or maximum 6 months prior - in the country of consumption and are retired on behalf of Philips. To quantify our emissions, we have used the residual mix emission factors derived from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) and Green-e where available. For our market-based scope 2 calculations in Europe and the US, we apply the Reliable Disclosure (RE-DISS) and AIB European Residual Mixes 2019 Version 1.1 (GWP Applied) and 2020 Green-e\u00ae Residual Mix Emissions Rates (2018 Data) where residual mix factors are available. For all other countries, we apply the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020 v1.1 (AR4 Applied) emission factors.\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 - 'Transportation & Distribution' covers all emissions from our logistics operations, where we measure the CO 2 e impact from all distribution flows that Philips is responsible for, covering all modes of transport: air freight, ocean freight, road freight and parcel shipments. Emissions are calculated based on the number of tonne-kilometers (or TEU.km for ocean freight) transported. A tonne.km is a measurement unit corresponding to the transport of one metric ton over one kilometer. For ocean freight, we measure the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) over a distance of one kilometer (TEU.km). Distances differ per mode of transport as a plane (for air freight or medium- to long-distance parcels) flies in a direct line, a container vessel can only take sea routes and a truck can only use the existing road networks. All distances are calculated modespecific, and DEFRA 2020 and Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) emission factors are assigned to convert tonne.km or TEU.km to CO 2 e emissions. The CCWG emission factors have been implemented from 2020 onwards only. For ocean freight and air freight we apply an additional 3% of 'last leg' emissions, estimating the additional impact from/to the airport or port. For air freight and parcel shipments, we define the haul types\n\n(distinguishing between short, medium and long-haul shipments), as emissions differ per tonne.km depending on the haul type, as typically more fuel is consumed per kilometer over shorter distances compared to long distances as a result of high fuel consumption during take-off versus flying idle at high altitudes. Due to the complexity of distinguishing between upstream and downstream logistic movements we report both under the GHG protocol Category 9 - Downstream Transportation & Distribution. Emissions from non-Philips-managed warehouses and emissions from returns of vehicles and/or vessels are out of scope.\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 - Business Travel covers any mode of transportation that is used by employees for business purposes and operated by a third party, excluding commuting. To calculate business travel emissions, we distinguish air travel and automobile travel. For automobile travel, we include leased vehicles and rented vehicles. All other modes of transportation are not considered due to their minimal usage for business purposes and negligible total impact (e.g. trains in the Netherlands run on renewable electricity).\n\nOne input for the calculation of CO 2 emissions from 'Transportation & Distribution' is distances travelled for shipments. We calculate the distances of shipment lanes using third party input, which is based on port coordinates for ocean freight, airport coordinates for air freight and city-to-city distances for road and parcel freight. For road and parcel freight we use city-to-city distances for the majority of lanes. When city-to-city distances are not available, we use average distances.\n\nScope 3 emissions from employee commuting, upstream transportation and distribution, outsourced warehousing activities, purchased goods and services and product use by our customers are not included in our operational carbon footprint. For more information on our scope 1,2 and 3 calculation method, please refer to our ESG download section.\n\n## Employee Engagement Index (EEI)\n\nThe Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single measure of the overall level of employee engagement at Philips. It is a combination of perceptions and attitudes related to employee satisfaction, commitment and advocacy.\n\nThe reported figures are based on the Employee Survey. The total score of the employee engagement is an average of the quarterly results of the survey. The results are calculated by taking the average of the answered questions of the surveys.",

Five other Executive Committee members, our Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer, our Chief Human Resources Officer, our Chief Business Leader Precision Diagnosis and our Chief International Markets Market Leader, sit on the ESG Committee together with functional executives. The ESG Committee normally convenes four times per year, defines Philips' ESG strategy, commitments, programs and policies, monitors progress and takes corrective action where needed.\n\nProgress on ESG is communicated internally and externally (www.results.philips.com) on a quarterly basis and at least annually in the Executive Committee and Supervisory Board.\n\n## External assurance 13.1.10\n\nEY has provided reasonable assurance on whether the information in Materiality analysis, starting on page 13, ESG statements, starting on page 266 and Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 45, except for sections EU taxonomy framework in ESG reporting framework, starting on page 46, Remuneration policy, starting on page 73 and Risk management approach, starting on page 74 presents fairly, in all material respects, the sustainability performance in accordance with the reporting criteria. Please refer to Assurance report of the independent auditor, starting on page 296\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic indicators 13.2\n\nThis section provides summarized information on contributions made on an accruals basis to the most important economic stakeholders as a basis for driving economic growth. For a full understanding of each of these indicators, see the specific financial statements and notes in this report.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Distribution of direct economic benefits in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Suppliers: goods and services                     | 9,493  | 9,988  | 10,633 |\n| Employees: salaries and wages                     | 5,204  | 5,129  | 5,698  |\n| Shareholders: distribution from retained earnings | 758    | 773    | 741    |\n| Government: corporate income taxes                | 212    | (103)  | (113)  |\n| Capital providers: net interest                   | 160    | 141    | 210    |\n\nTotal purchased goods and services as included in cost of sales amounted to EUR 10.6 billion, representing 59.6% of total revenues of the Philips Group. Of this amount, approximately 53% was spent with global suppliers, the remainder with local suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, salaries and wages totaled EUR 5.7 billion, an increase of 11% compared to 2021, mainly driven by unfavorable foreign currency impact and wage inflation. See Income from operations, starting on page 162 for more information.\n\nPhilips' shareholders were given EUR 741 million including costs in the form of a dividend.\n\nIncome taxes amounted to a benefit of EUR 113 million. The effective income tax rate in 2022 was 6.5%, compared to (20.0)% in 2021, mainly due to a non-deductible goodwill impairment in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business and other non-deductible expenses such as share based compensation expenses, partly offset by recurring favorable tax incentives related to R&D investments, the innovation box regime in the Netherlands and export activities. For more information, see Income taxes, starting on page 168.\n\nPhilips supports global initiatives of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and UN (United Nations) to promote tax transparency and responsible tax management, taking into account the interests of various stakeholders, such as governments, shareholders, customers and the communities in which Philips operates.

This section provides additional information on (some of) the environmental performance parameters reported in Environmental performance, starting on page 52.\n\n## Circular Economy 13.3.1\n\nThe transition from a linear to a circular economy is essential to create a sustainable world that functions within the constraints of our one planet. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these resources more effectively. In addition to the use of renewable resources and energy efficiency, the transition to a circular economy will be essential to meet our global climate goals.\n\n## Circular Economy program\n\nThe Circular Economy program at Philips ran for the tenth year in 2022. It consists of the following strategic pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Circular design\n- \u00b7 Circular manufacturing and supply\n- \u00b7 Circular customer needs and business models\n- \u00b7 Circular lifetime asset management\n- \u00b7 Collect and ensure responsible end-of-use management, including Closing the loop\n- \u00b7 Partnering to drive global change\n- \u00b7 Transforming our organization, including embedding circular practices in our standard way of working\n\nAt Philips, we see huge opportunities for businesses to provide greater value to customers and our planet through innovative service models, smart upgrade paths, product take-back, refurbishing and remanufacturing programs, and software driving resource optimization, e.g. in the form of migration to the cloud, improved utilization rates and telehealth offerings.\n\nThis visual illustrates the different circular strategies that Philips is applying to move away from the take-make-waste economy towards more circular business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partnerships and global outreach\n\nPhilips leverages partnerships to help scale the circular economy globally. For example, our CEO is co-chair of the public-private Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, and is hosted by the World Resource Institute in The Hague. PACE's mission is to catalyze global leadership from business, government, and civil society to accelerate the transition from a linear to a circular economy that will improve human and environmental well-being for current and future generations.\n\nAs one of the key pillars under PACE, Philips has spearheaded the Circular Equipment Coalition, a group of front-running large equipment manufacturers, who all have committed to applying circular economy principles to preserve and recover value across the lifecycles of their respective products. The Capital Equipment Coalition consists of 16 organizations, with regional groups in Europe and North America. In 2022, knowledge was exchanged on regulatory barriers, procurement, raw materials, and circular metrics. A paper",

This year, we successfully integrated the EMF developed 'Basic Course for a Circular Economy' into our Philips University curriculum, which employees across Philips have access to. Next, Philips is also partnering with other leading organizations to drive action at scale, such as Healthcare without Harm, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Dutch Circular Transition Teams.\n\nIn 2022, Philips supported the global launch of 'Going Circular' a feature documentary showcasing an inspiring vision for a circular future.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nThe Circular Revenues percentage reflects our revenues as a percentage of total Philips revenues from validated products, services and solutions that contribute to circular practices. The validation is based on the Philips circularity requirements for different business models listed below.\n\nIn 2022, we reached 18% circular revenues compared to 16% in 2021.\n\n## Performance and Access-based models\n\nRevenues from hardware where ownership remains with Philips or an affiliated financing company.\n\n## Upgrades/lifetime extension on site or remote\n\nRevenues from hardware which is upgraded to better functionality and/or extended lifetime, e.g. through lifetime extension services or a software upgrade that enables the hardware to deliver more value with same amount of materials.\n\n## Refurbished/Remanufactured products/systems\n\nRevenues from selling refurbished or remanufactured products/systems with re-used content >30% by total weight .\n\n## Refurbished/Remanufactured parts/elements\n\nRevenues from used components that must be refurbished/remanufactured or tested/ repaired in such a way that they are fit for use again and contain >30% re-used parts or materials by total component weight. The component can either be a stand-alone component or part of a new product/system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Products with recycled plastics content\n\nRevenues from products with a recycled plastics content of >25% post-consumer recycled plastics or >30% post-industrial/post-consumer recycled plastics by total weight of eligible plastics.\n\n## Software optimizing resource use\n\nRevenues from software that enables resource efficiency, such as remote interaction, increased hardware utilization and cloud computing.\n\n## Analog to digital\n\nRevenues from products that have been designed to connect to generic hardware rather than dedicated hardware, e.g. transducers that can connect directly to a hospital worker's mobile device, instead of requiring a dedicated monitor.\n\n## Circular Design\n\nOur EcoDesign program is a key enabler to lower our overall environmental footprint and is thus a key driver for our Climate Action and Circular Economy programs. By 2025, we aim for all our new products introductions to be EcoDesigned according to our EcoDesign requirements. In 2022, we sharpened our Circular Design requirements, which will be further implemented in 2023.\n\n## Circular practices at our sites\n\nAt our sites, we also aim to continuously increase our circularity. We do this by implementing Circular Materials Management and sending zero waste to landfill. In 2022, we ran an employee initiative leveraging the collective expertise of our workforce across 13 sites around the globe with the shared ambition to reduce waste. Over 90 employees participated, resulting in over 10 ideas now put into motion. For more information on our programs, please refer to Sustainable Operations, starting on page 56.\n\n## Closing the loop for professional medical equipment\n\nClosing the loop plays an important role on our road towards a circular economy. By reclaiming medical systems, Philips can responsibly offer pre-owned equipment in the most effective and efficient way possible. As the designer and legal manufacturer, Philips has the know-how, data, analytics and possibilities to perform an optimal triage to maximize the value of customers' systems. When closing the loop, Philips ensured that these systems do not end up in landfill, but are made available for refurbishment or parts harvesting/recovery. If that is not possible, materials are recycled in a certified way.\n\nPre-owned systems and parts that are refurbished and/or remanufactured or recovered are brought back to customers by Philips as either circular systems or spare parts. As this creates new value for Philips, it enables Philips to offer customers an attractive trade-in value. In",

Building on long-standing experience of recycled plastics in consumer products, we have expanded this to our Grooming and Beauty business with the introduction of hairdryers BHD356 and BHD308 containing >25% recycled plastics.\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nOur Circular Editions offers: refurbished imaging systems for sale; system upgrades such as SmartPath at customer premises to enhance performance and extend lifetime; and re-use of spare parts in maintenance services. Our Lumify portable ultrasound solution can be accessed by our customers through a subscription model. We also provide services for system upgrades such as Technology Maximiser that help keep systems in state-of-the-art condition and software upgrades like SmartSpeed, helping customers to scan more patients per day while using the same equipment.\n\nOne of our flagship products is the BlueSeal magnet, the industry's first and only 1.5T fully sealed magnet, relieving our customers from helium-related complications and unpredictability. BlueSeal magnet requires only 0.5% of helium compared to a conventional Philips MR system. Addressing helium scarcity through innovating with purpose to secure the future for all MR patients.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nA number of businesses offer performance and access-based models, such as ventilators, Monitoring-as-a-Service and mobile cardiac telemetry monitoring where monitors and wearable sensors are returned and processed to be used again; software revenues include telehealth solutions such as eICU and Tasy Electronic Medical Record (EMR) running on the cloud. We also provide Software Evolution services for our patient monitors where the software upgrades helps to extend their lifetime.\n\n## Closing material loops on products and materials\n\nIn addition to tracking circular revenue, we are also working to achieve transparency on the material flows connected with the Philips businesses. In 2022, Philips put an estimated total of some 62,000 tonnes of products on the market. This assessment is based on sales data combined with product-specific weights. 48% of the total product weight was delivered\n\nthrough our Personal Health businesses and 52% through our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care businesses.\n\nWe can account for some 7,000 tonnes or approximately 11% of these products being collected, re-used or recycled globally. Europe has advanced collection systems in place. In these countries we have an average return rate of around 40-50%. National legislation is required to create the level playing field needed to set up efficient recycling systems beyond the EU. The main pathways and quantities for material re-use in 2022 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Trade-in and return for resale as refurbished products and for spare parts harvesting (Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care): some 1,374 tonnes, a decrease compared to 1,711 tonnes in 2021, mainly caused by material shortages and a different product mix in the refurbished product portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Collective collection and recycling schemes in accordance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collection schemes. These products are broken down into the main material fractions and provided to the market via our recycling partners\n- \u00b7 850 tonnes (estimated) from Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care field returns, following the WEEE category 8 classification, indicating a slight decrease compared to the previous year (800 tonnes)\n- \u00b7 5,200 tonnes (estimated) from Personal Health, following the WEEE category 2 classification\n\nMore information can be found on the Philips circular economy website.\n\n## Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 13.3.2\n\nPhilips recognizes the importance of healthy ecosystems and biodiversity for our company, our employees, and society as a whole. Therefore, Philips launched the Natural Capital program which is an addition to existing sustainability programs. This program is dedicated to reducing Philips' chemicals footprint and water consumption and improving Biodiversity. By systematically quantifying, and reducing the environmental impact of our operations, supply chain and the use phase of our products, we actively aim to protect and restore biodiversity. Philips acknowledges its dependency and impact on Natural Capital and aims to iteratively improve its understanding to drive regenerative decisions.\n\nPhilips aims to restore and enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) at our sites and to actively promote ecosystem restoration activities through partnerships with, among others, NGOs, local communities, and governments. Philips created a BES community and trained employees on all manufacturing sites in ecosystem services. As a result, the ecosystem services of Philips global manufacturing sites have been mapped and quantified. Based on this data, each manufacturing site delivered a list of potential measures to enhance biodiversity on-site. Philips aims to implement biodiversity improvement measures on sites globally in 2023. Improving BES at our sites and thereby also improving the working",

At the same time, Philips is aware that the total environmental impact of the full value chain is substantial, especially upstream in the mining industry. Philips considers improving biodiversity on its own land as a first important step towards reducing biodiversity impact over the full value chain.\n\nHaving become carbon-neutral in our operations by year-end 2020, and with our drive to send zero waste to landfill, focus on circular materials management, and enhanced BES, the environmental impact of our sites will be further optimized.\n\n## Sustainable Operations 13.3.3\n\nOur Sustainable Operations programs relate to improving the environmental performance of our manufacturing facilities and focus on most of the contributors to climate change, but also address water, recycling of waste and chemical substances.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Sustainable Sites\n\n|                                | baseline year 2020   | target 2025    | 2022 actual   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Total CO 2 from manufacturing  | 0 Ktonnes            | 0 Ktonnes      | 0 Ktonnes 1)  |\n| Water withdrawal               | 710,108 m3 2)        | 5% reduction   | 677,632 m3    |\n| Zero waste to landfill         | 2.6%                 | less than 0.5% | 0.0%          |\n| Circular Material Management   | 90%                  | 95%            | 91%           |\n| Hazardous substances emissions | 2,465 kilos          | 25% reduction  | 1,548 kilos   |\n| VOC emissions                  | 79 tonnes            | 10% reduction  | 77 tonnes     |\n\n## Energy use in manufacturing\n\nTotal energy consumption in manufacturing amounted to 338.1 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2022, which is a 4% reduction compared to the 350.8 GWh in 2021. Diagnosis & Treatment accounted for about 50% and Personal Health 37% of the consumption. Diagnosis & Treatment energy consumption decreased by 3%, mainly due to energy savings plans in our large sites and operational changes mitigated by the increased production volumes in India. Connected Care reported a 7% reduction due to changes in the production volumes. Energy\n\nconsumption at Personal Health decreased by 3%, mainly driven by the reduced consumption volumes in Europe due to the good weather conditions and operational changes.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total energy consumption in manufacturing 1) in gigawatt hours (GWh)\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |  164.7 |  151.9 |  161.1 |  175.3 |  169.9 |\n| Connected Care        |   79.7 |   78.1 |   63.6 |   44.7 |   41.5 |\n| Personal Health       |  135.3 |  134.7 |  114.4 |  130.8 |  126.7 |\n| Philips Group         |  379.7 |  364.7 |  339.2 |  350.8 |  338.1 |\n\n## Operational carbon footprint and energy efficiency - 2022 details\n\nPhilips has been carbon neutral in its operations from 2020 onwards, after having reduced our operational carbon footprint significantly during the past years (50% decrease in CO 2 emissions in 2022 compared to 2017). In 2022, our carbon footprint decreased by 16% compared to 2021, resulting in a total of 438 kilotonnes CO 2 .\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent\n\n|                           |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Logistics                 |    540 |    470 |    415 |    417 |    327 |\n| Business travel           |    147 |    152 |     70 |     72 |     86 |\n| Non-industrial operations |     39 |     25 |     15 |     14 |     11 |\n| Manufacturing             |     23 |     21 |     18 |     16 |     14 |\n\nThe 2022 results can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting for 3% of our total footprint, total CO 2 emissions from our manufacturing sites decreased by 13% due to lower overall energy consumption as a result of our efforts to reduce overall energy consumption and phase-out fossil fuels from our operations. All global manufacturing sites have been running on 100% renewable electricity since 2019, sourcing an overall 78% renewable energy in 2022, covering all energy carriers, up from 75% in 2021.\n- \u00b7 CO 2 emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses, etc.), representing 2% of total emissions, decreased by 21% in 2022 due to lower energy consumption resulting from hybrid working policies and implemented energy efficiency projects. All sites continue to run on 100% renewable electricity from 2020 onwards. Overall, our nonindustrial sites sourced 70% renewable energy in 2022, an increase of 5% compared to 2021.

Various measures have been introduced to drive down emissions from air freight, such as multi-modal shipments, a transition from air to ocean freight, a stricter air freight policy, and optimization of our warehouse locations. Our ocean freight emissions decreased as a result of an improved measurement approach, whereby carrierspecific emission factors are leveraged from the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG). This has only been applied to the years 2020 and 2021, which have been restated accordingly. Next, emissions in 2021 from ocean and road freight included combined shipments of our Domestic Appliances business as well as Philips business. We were not able to exclude all the Domestic Appliances businesses part from our datasets completely. In 2022 ,however, this has been fully resolved.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Operational carbon footprint for logistics in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent\n\n|                  |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Air transport    |    353 |    279 |    262 |    252 |    214 |\n| Road transport   |     66 |     71 |     64 |     55 |     27 |\n| Ocean transport  |     84 |     75 |     43 |     39 |     22 |\n| Parcel shipments |     37 |     45 |     46 |     71 |     64 |\n| Philips Group    |    540 |    470 |    415 |    417 |    327 |\n\n## Carbon emissions in manufacturing\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our manufacturing operations totaled 14 kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent in 2022, 12% lower than in 2021. Direct CO 2 emissions decreased by 14% mainly driven by the energy saving projects, decreased natural gas consumption in European sites and operational changes in different locations. Indirect CO 2 emissions remained at a low level due to the use of 100% electricity from renewable sources. Emissions from other greenhouse gases remained at the same level.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total carbon emissions in manufacturing in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent\n\n|                        |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Direct CO 2            |     18 |     17 |     15 |     14 |     12 |\n| Indirect CO 2          |      2 |      1 |      1 |      1 |      1 |\n| Other greenhouse gases |      3 |      3 |      2 |      1 |      1 |\n| Philips Group          |     23 |     21 |     18 |     16 |     14 |\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total carbon emissions in manufacturing per segment in kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |     11 |      9 |      9 |      9 |      7 |\n| Connected Care        |      6 |      5 |      4 |      2 |      2 |\n| Personal Health       |      6 |      7 |      5 |      5 |      5 |\n| Philips Group         |     23 |     21 |     18 |     16 |     14 |\n\nCO 2 emissions in 2022 reduced to 14 kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent. This was driven by changes in our operations, fossil fuel reduction, and product mix in various regions. Diagnosis & Treatment CO 2 emissions decreased by 2 kilotonnes CO 2 -equivalent due to the less natural gas consumption in 2 sites in Europe. Connected Care reported a slight increase. At Personal Health, CO 2 emissions remained at the same level.\n\nIn 2022, all manufacturing sites received 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. Our operations in the US have been powered by wind energy since 2017 from the Los Mirasoles windfarm. Additionally, our operations in the Netherlands have received electricity from the Bouwdokken and Krammer wind farms since 2019, all helping to deliver on the ambition to remain carbon-neutral in our operations.\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nPhilips recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing and mitigating climate-related risks to ensure business continuity and resilience. This 2022 integrated financial, social and environmental report aims to follow the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nIn 2022, relevant risks and opportunities have been quantified by applying Philips' internal risk assessment methodology. This ensures alignment with the risk management team, increasing cross-business comparability and integration with already existing risk screening procedures. Moreover, physical risk factors were evaluated on a site-specific level by exploring 25 of our financially material sites in more detail. Transition risks on the other hand, were assessed on a company level and by subject matter experts. The reason for this differentiation is because physical risks vary on a regional level while transition forces generally apply on a global scale.\n\nThe site-specific analysis leveraged both the external Munich RE NATHAN tool and internal site experts. While RE NATHAN uses scientific models to determine how exposed different regions are to climate risk factors, the site-specific experts have access to specialized knowledge on the climate change preparedness of the sites. Combining both internal and external expertise ensured we have a holistic view that considers both regional implications and Philips specific implications. RE NATHAN assessed which of the following hazards are most threatening in the medium-term accounting for four global warming scenarios (RCP 1.9, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5): drought, heat stress, precipitation, river flood, and tropical",

In case one or multiple risk factors seemed impactful in the future we then asked site specific experts to provide us with a more detailed impact and control measure evaluation. This thereby provided us with a good overview on how exposed we currently are to extreme or chronic weather conditions and highlighted key action points.\n\nWe also further assessed internal and external forces pushing Philips to a low carbon future considering three global warming scenarios. In our 1.5 and 2 \u00b0C model (RCP 1.9 and 2.6) we assumed that strong cross sector pressures exist. Governments enforce strict environmental rules, society is environmentally conscious, and the private sector invests in collaborative innovations. In contrast, the 4 \u00baC global warming scenario (RCP 4.5) assumed short-sighted governments focused on protectionism, customers with a cost orientation, and a private sector focused on product innovation. For each scenario, experts were then consulted to determine the potential likelihood of the predefined transition risks/opportunities becoming material. We, furthermore, assessed the potential impact of the risks/ opportunities unraveling and to what extent we can control the underpinning risk or exploit the opportunity.\n\nThrough our ambition to reduce CO 2 emissions in our entire value chain in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario, we are reducing our exposure to transition risks, such as changing legislation, changing customer demands and carbon pricing. Nonetheless, strong government policies in line with the Paris Agreement could result in higher carbon pricing impacts for Philips, its supply chain, and its customers. Furthermore, a global financial downturn could also promote inertia in the field of environmentally friendly innovations. Hence, our Science Based Targets are a key factor in mitigating the risk associated with the changing legislation, customer preferences and preventing inertia.\n\nIn 2023, we plan to further assess the impact of climate change on our value chain and continue to standardize our assessment process. More information on Philips' climate action program can be found in Sustainable Operations, starting on page 56.\n\nMore detailed information on our TCFD analysis can be found on the Sustainability website.\n\n## Hazardous substances emissions\n\nCompared to heavy industry, our sites have relatively few chemical emissions and we have voluntary targets to reduce them. However, most of our manufacturing operations have processes that result in some emissions to air and water. Therefore, we carefully monitor all emissions and are working to limit hazardous chemical and VOC emissions. Many of these decisions happen at the product and process design stage.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Hazardous substances emissions\n\n|                       | 2018   |   2019 |   2020 | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 636    |    104 |     92 | 181    | 175    |\n| Connected Care        | 63     |     46 |     20 | 1,239  | 863    |\n| Personal Health       | 360    |    336 |    455 | 1,242  | 510    |\n| Philips Group         | 1,059  |    486 |    567 | 2,662  | 1,548  |\n\nAt Philips, we want to track the impact of chemical substances on a life-cycle basis and, based on a risk-level classification and precautionary principle, to ensure implementation in an active and practical way. The Classified Substances List (CSL) has been set up to manage, restrict, control and/or monitor chemical substances according to regulation requirements and/or known risks. In its CSL, Philips captures all substances with no current legislative restriction, but a foreseen, future indication as 'Risk Level II', requiring action to evaluate the measures to reduce exposure and emissions and, if possible, to evaluate and implement less harmful alternatives. For its chemicals reduction program ending in 2020, Philips used the CSL from 2015. In 2021, with the start of the new 5-year program, we applied the latest CSL, which includes many more chemicals. Therefore, the 2021 results are significantly higher than the 2020 results. In 2022, we continued to phase out and replace hazardous substances at our industrial sites. The hazardous substances emissions amounted to 1,548 kg in 2022, which is a 42% reduction compared to the 2,662 kg in 2021. In the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment the emissions slightly decreased. The emissions in the Connected Care businesses segment amounted to 863 kg, which is a 30% reduction compared to the prior year caused by replacing harmful chemicals and lower production volumes in a factory in Asia. In the Personal Health businesses segment the hazardous substances emissions were 510 kg in 2022, a significant 59% reduction due to more efficient processes.\n\n## VOC emissions\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## VOC emissions in tonnes\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |     44 |     46 |     44 |     42 |     38 |\n| Connected Care        |      6 |      6 |      3 |      3 |      2 |\n| Personal Health       |     69 |     54 |     32 |     33 |     37 |\n| Philips Group         |    119 |    106 |     79 |     78 |     77 |\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC) can react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other harmful compounds to create highly toxic particulates (PM 2.5), often referred to as ground-level harmful smog, which stimulate disease in plants, inhibit seed production, and hinder fertilization.

The Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, which represent 49% of total VOC emissions, decreased by 10% due to process optimizations and changes in production. VOC emissions in the Connected Care businesses decreased due to lower production levels, and VOC emissions in the Personal Health businesses (representing 48% of total VOC emissions) increased by 12% compared to 2021, mainly driven by the increased production volume in a factory in Asia.\n\n## ISO 14001 certification\n\nThe Philips manufacturing sites are certified individually. In 2022, 96% of reporting manufacturing sites were certified, compared to 92% in 2021. The increase is caused by the organizational changes. The one site which is not certified yet, is planning to have the certificate in 2023. The integration of newly acquired companies is in progress; smaller sites are required to maintain robust environmental management systems while external certification is not mandatory.\n\n## Philips Group\n\nISO 14001 certifications as a % of all reporting organizations\n\n|               | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Philips Group | 83%    | 79%    | 81%    | 92%    | 96%    |\n\n## Environmental incidents\n\nIn 2022, three environmental incidents were reported at a Diagnosis & Treatment site. These incidents are related to water leakages in different parts of the factory and these have been fixed. Furthermore, two sites reported non-compliances which were related to water discharge requirements and labelling waste; these violations were corrected immediately and no fines were issued.\n\nTwo environmental incidents related to a water leakages were reported at two Connected Care sites. The water leakages were investigated and fixed.\n\nIn Personal Health, two sites reported three environmental incidents. One site reported a water leakage which was fixed. The other site reported two incidents: one was related to emissions to air due to a refrigerant leak. Immediate corrective action was taken, no fine was imposed. The other incident related to a soil contamination due to a leakage. After investigation it was concluded that remediation action was not required and no fine was imposed. Furthermore, non-compliances were reported which were related to noise and water discharge requirements, and no fines were issued.\n\nTo find out about our sustainability results at global and regional and market level, go to the Philips results hub.",

This section provides additional information on (some of) the Social performance parameters reported in Social performance, starting on page 62\n\n## Measuring health impacts 13.4.1\n\nIn 2022, we continued our collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to measure our social impact to assess the positive contributions to health effects offered by publicly traded companies related to medical devices. We further explored the granularity of the pilot methodology and, using a common ESG framework, linked the potential measurable impact of medical devices to targets in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 ( Good Health and Well-being ).\n\nIn an expanded use case, this study estimated the potential benefits of using ultrasound medical devices to detect health problems for patients in several countries and regions of the world as a case study to show how to link science-based impacts and specific SDG Targets. This study is expected to support and illustrate how to guide investments toward publicly traded companies that bring products and services into the market with quantifiable impacts linked to a common framework that fulfills the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

In order to ensure that our colleagues feel a sense of belonging right from the start and have clarity on what is expected from them in their roles, we have established an effective, digitally enabled onboarding approach both for new hires and internal moves, ensuring alignment across all our businesses, markets and functions.\n\nWe also support our People Leaders through capability building and toolkits, since we believe onboarding is a key leadership accountability. We train new leaders (both new to the role and to the organization) on what it means to be a Philips leader and how to drive key people processes effectively.\n\nIn 2022, we incorporated mandatory role-based education into a new hire's onboarding journey, underscoring the importance of patient safety and being compliant . We have also adopted a richer measurement approach to examine the impact of our onboarding interventions. 90% of new hire respondents rated their 6-month onboarding experience as positive in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Career development\n\nWe see our talent as our most differentiating enterprise asset. Our goal is to enable everyone to thrive at Philips, and we recognize that it is important to invest in strategic capabilities, and for both leaders and employees to share accountability for career development. We expect our leaders to scout for talent, develop people and upgrade capabilities, so that we can continue to build a diverse, future-oriented workforce where inclusion is key, and transparent, ongoing feedback enables all of our people to grow.\n\nWe support our people in navigating their own career and stimulate our managers to have meaningful career dialogues with their people. To this end, we continued our Continuous Feedback and Continuous Talent Dialog approach in 2022. We also implemented technology-enabled 'gig' working within Philips, giving employees the opportunity to build their skills in new areas outside of their core jobs.\n\nWhilst continuing to focus on our goals in our People Performance Management, in 2022 we increased attention for how our people achieve those goals, to ensure they get feedback and develop themselves on both dimensions. There has also been more focus on how our employees progress against their development goals and demonstrate the Philips Behaviors (Leadership Asks for leaders). This more balanced view of performance will drive more holistic conversations between employee and manager throughout the year, with regular touchpoints for feedback built in along the way. We continue to stimulate cross-moves (across businesses, between markets or functions) to promote collaboration and give people challenging learning experiences.\n\nPhilips also gave meaningful work experience to 1,882 interns, offering 498 of them permanent employment after their internship.\n\n## Leadership\n\nOur leaders play a crucial role in developing our people. To best support our leaders in this, we have invested in our company-wide leadership framework (Philips Leadership Asks), which is embedded in the Philips Business System, as well as a global portfolio of development assets such as Leadership Journeys, Leadership Programs, Masterclasses, Team Effectiveness solutions, Coaching & Mentoring, Development Centers and Assessments. The Leadership Journeys are facilitated multi-day immersive experiences, in which a selected senior management group focuses on core business challenges as well as the behavioral shifts needed to accelerate results. Masterclasses focusing on strategic capabilities are organized for our most senior managers. The content of these masterclasses has been made available for all our leaders through playlists to enable further cascading into our organization.",

All these programs consist of various elements, including assessments, (peer) coaching, workshops, action learning and individual learning based on pre-work and reflection exercises. The Philips continuous feedback process is embedded in these programs as part of the learning journey. Team effectiveness solutions offered include playbooks, team diagnostic tooling, and assessment tooling (including 180/360 feedback) for individual leaders.\n\n## Learning\n\nPhilips focuses on experience-based career development, giving our people the opportunity to identify and gain the experiences necessary to support our health technology strategy and strengthen their employability.\n\nIn 2022, we continued with experimental learning, enabling multiple ways of virtual/remote learning for our employees. Philips University continued to deliver on its mission of a lifetime of learning in Philips by further optimizing the way learning is created and offered. By mirroring learning requests to company-wide strategic priorities and introducing smarter ways of working and supporting processes, Philips University is committed to deliver learning solutions that truly impact our people and Philips as a whole.\n\nBy the end of 2022, more than 1,344,956 courses had been taken through Philips University (2021: 863,000), representing a total of nearly 1,880,416 training hours (2021: 830,000), with 1,009,459 training completions (2021: 835,000).\n\nIn 2022, seven dedicated trainings were deployed to all our employees to ensure we refreshed the fundamental Quality and Patient safety knowledge needed in the health technology environment across the whole of Philips.\n\n## Talent attraction 13.4.3\n\nThrough 2022 we filled over 16,000 positions across the organization, of which over 33% were internal appointments, up from 31% in 2021. Our two strategic external hiring channels are Direct-Sourcing and Referrals, which together delivered 43% of our external hires in 2022.\n\nThrough collaboration with the TENT partnership for refugees, we continue to offer opportunities to refugees across our operations. In 2022, we expanded our hiring commitment: our new goal is to provide 150 workplaces to refugees by 2025 (previous target: 100 by 2024). In addition, we committed to mentor 50 refugee women in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK over 3 years.\n\nIn 2022, we hired 52 refugees and kicked off the first round of the Refugee women mentorship program with 16 pairs of mentor-mentee matches.\n\nWe strengthened our focus on strategic Employer Branding and Recruitment Marketing initiatives as enablers of our organizational People Strategy priority to attract the best talent in increasingly competitive labor market conditions. We optimized our approach to media activity with targeted attraction campaigns focused on the most critical talent segments and strategic capabilities, such as informatics. This led to a 10-fold increase in leads in our talent pool and a 159% increase in applications compared to 2021.\n\nWe continued our always-on content program promoting our Employer Value Proposition across key career-related channels. We aim to strengthen our positioning as a peoplecentric, purpose-driven health technology company focusing on quality and patient -safety, and as an employer of choice for inclusion, diversity, equity and well-being.\n\nOur combined efforts drove 2.6 million unique visitors to our Careers site, an increase of 50% compared to 2021.

The structure of the volunteering program has since changed, with a stronger emphasis on skilled volunteering, which requires specific expertise and fewer hands-on team activities. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 The support of Philips employees during the pandemic at the start of 2022, where volunteers transported, assembled, and installed donated equipment for India.\n- \u00b7 Shared expertise of Philips employees during a conference with Philips Foundation Impact Investments B.V. in the Netherlands, which supported 10 entrepreneurs with challenges in IT, HR, laws and regulations, government relations, marketing, strategy, finance, etc.\n- \u00b7 In the US, Philips employees in Alpharetta, Cambridge, and Bothell have participated in volunteer events to assemble over 3,000 clean birthing kits in partnership with MedShare. Clean birthing kits contain 13 essentials needed to deliver a baby in parts of the world where medical care is lacking, designed to support mothers and newborn babies in marginalized regions of the US as part of Philips Foundation's mission to provide access to quality healthcare for underserved communities.\n\nWhen the conflict in Ukraine began to affect the population, there was a clear desire to assist the people of Ukraine with a practical mindset, which led to the collection, funding, transportation and distribution of many necessary health supplies (maternal and child care",

In the Netherlands, for example, we run a special employment program, WGP (Werkgelegenheidsplan, or Philips Employment Scheme), to offer vulnerable groups of external jobseekers a work experience placement, usually combined with training. Since the scheme's launch in 1983, over 13,365 people have participated, and around 70% found a regular job after taking part. In 2022, we had an inflow of 63 candidates bringing the number of participants in 2022 to 129. The WGP program is also accessible to refugees, and in 2022 we had 17 refugees participating.\n\nA scientific study, published in 2020, into the long-term impact of the WGP program has shown that the chance of finding a job after participating in the WGP program improved by 18%.\n\n## Health and Safety performance 13.4.6\n\nIn 2022, as the COVID-19 entered the endemic phase, Philips continued to refresh and enhance the Health and Safety (H&S) program. As normal activities resumed, the H&S programs were re-deployed. Of note was the completion of the global audit program, with nine audits completed worldwide.\n\nPolicy, Procedures and Management Systems: Philips continued to build a comprehensive global Health & Safety Management System with the deployment of 10 updated Philips Corporate Safety Standards (PCSS) in 2022. A total of 71 PCSS were deployed by the end of 2022. The PCSS are supported with training materials in Philips University and Management Guidance notes. Management System Certifications ISO 45001 are in place for 24 manufacturing locations. Seven country organizations are certified to ISO 45001, with further certifications planned for 2023.\n\nCompliance: In 2022, Philips continued the deployment of the Compliance tracking tool ENHESA at all operational sites and deployed it to the market locations where Philips has a significant presence. A review of applicable regulations and compliance status was in scope. In 2022, 9 H&S audits were performed in manufacturing and market organizations. An enhanced audit program is planned for 2023.\n\nStructure and Responsibility : In 2022, the H&S organization supporting market activities continued to be improved and consolidated, and all markets now have an H&S structure in place reporting to Regional Leaders with the necessary resources allocated. Health and Safety reviews were completed with Market Operations leaders to raise the profile of H&S and drive safety programs with close leadership support.\n\nIn 2022, the Philips Health and Safety Assurance letter was completed. This process requires a full Health and Safety review at every level of the organization that verifies that the Philips H&S policy is understood, a verified H&S Management System is in place, compliance requirements are met, risk assessments have been completed with plans in place to control/ reduce significant risks, and sufficient resources (including adequate staff) are in place. The process is initiated at the lowest organizational level and raised progressively to more senior leadership and finally to Executive level, with review and sign off at each stage.\n\nRisk assessments: In 2022, Health and Safety continued to deploy the high-level risk assessment process to all operational sites and relevant markets to provide a strategic overview of the risk profile in Philips using the Philips Corporate Risk Assessment protocol. This process has identified exceptional risks at specific locations as well as systemic risks across Philips. In 2022, systemic risks were addressed through company-wide H&S campaigns to drive performance improvements. Risk assessments were also reviewed during the Assurance letter process, and sites and markets have a clearer understanding of the risks they face, and the controls needed to address them.\n\nTraining and Communication: In 2022 we offered an expanded library of Underwriters Ltd. (UL) safety e-learning courses (532 H&S courses in 17 languages) in the Philips University. Four new H&S campaigns were launched in 2022 - Infection Prevention/BBP, Electrical Safety, Lone Worker, and Safe/Unsafe Behaviors - and a series of 12 health awareness topics were circulated throughout our community (e.g. thyroid, colorectal cancer, stroke and kidney health, monkeypox and heat-related illnesses).\n\nOccupational Health: In 2022, focus on COVID-19 management was gradually reduced, which allowed more time for other activities. At the end of August, it was communicated that outbreak management would shift from the central crisis management organization to local Market/Country management teams. Health and Safety would remain primarily responsible for maintaining all infection prevention guidance, periodic reporting, and organizational support.\n\nContinued focus was placed on enhancing two critical programs, Ergonomics and Mental Health and Well-being. Due to the socio-economic and political issues and the personnel reductions announced at the end of the year, Mental Health and Well-being remained a topic of high attention. Mental Health Champions were trained across the globe and the program was further matured with structural support and training (close to 200 Champions by the end of 2022). Within the Ergonomics program there were some 112 trained Champions by the end of 2022. These Champions can support job analysis and incident investigations and help drive ergonomic improvements. With an increased focus on ergonomics during our field activities, the number of lost workday cases due to sprains and strains in North America customer-focused teams was 144 days, a significant improvement compared to 2021 (275). With the introduction of Ergonomics Champions, stretch programs,",

This resulted in a new Philips Excellence Process Framework process towards the end of 2022.\n\nMetrics : Health and Safety metrics were further developed in 2022 to support existing metrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Recordable Accident Rate : In 2022, we recorded 172 TRCs (213 in 2021), i.e. cases where the injured employee is unable to work for one or more days, received medical treatment or sustained an industrial illness.\n- \u00b7 Lost Workday Case Rate : In 2022, we recorded 81 LWCs (114 in 2021), i.e. cases where the injured employee is unable to work (either his/her normal work or restricted work as determined by an occupational physician on any day after the day on which the injury occurred).\n\nProactive metrics : More emphasis was placed on proactive metrics whilst retaining the existing reportable accident rate. The metrics are aggregated into a scorecard, to provide one consolidated proactive performance metric, which is presented at business level. Specific proactive safety metrics include:\n\n- \u00b7 Shop floor visits (Gemba walks) completed: 13,002 (target: 11,880)\n- \u00b7 Safety problem-solving events (Kaizens) implemented: 6,186 (target: 5,940)\n- \u00b7 Behavioral Safety Observations: 4,585 (target 2,467)\n- \u00b7 Training: 46,701 trainings completed (target 20,219)\n- \u00b7 Corrective action closure: Average days to Close: 74\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total recordable cases per 100 FTE\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |   0.55 |   0.61 |   0.45 |   0.53 |   0.41 |\n| Connected Care        |   0.35 |   0.34 |   0.31 |   0.31 |   0.19 |\n| Personal Health       |   0.22 |   0.18 |   0.3  |   0.24 |   0.27 |\n| Other                 |   0.22 |   0.24 |   0.16 |   0.21 |   0.17 |\n| Philips Group         |   0.3  |   0.32 |   0.24 |   0.29 |   0.23 |\n\nAdditionally, we recorded 81 Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWICs), i.e. occupational injury cases where the injured person is unable to work for one or more days after the injury. This represents a 29% decrease compared with 114 in 2021. The LWIC rate decreased to 0.11 per\n\n100 FTEs, compared with 0.16 in 2021. The number of Lost Workdays caused by injury decreased by 216 days to 4,020 days in 2022.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Lost workday injuries per 100 FTEs\n\n|                       |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |   0.2  |   0.33 |   0.27 |   0.28 |   0.21 |\n| Connected Care        |   0.13 |   0.09 |   0.11 |   0.09 |   0.09 |\n| Personal Health       |   0.16 |   0.14 |   0.22 |   0.16 |   0.09 |\n| Other                 |   0.11 |   0.09 |   0.06 |   0.12 |   0.08 |\n| Philips Group         |   0.14 |   0.14 |   0.12 |   0.16 |   0.11 |\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nIn the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment, the number of Health and Safety incidents decreased in 2022 to 31 LWICs compared to 43 in 2021. The LWIC rate decreased to 0.21 compared to 0.28 in 2021. The total number of recordable cases for the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment decreased to 59 (81 in 2021), mainly due to less recorded incidents in our factories North America.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nHealth and Safety performance in the Connected Care businesses segment in 2022 improved compared to the prior year: 6 LWICs (6 in 2021). Correspondingly, the LWIC rate remained at the same level as 2021 (0.09). However, the total number of recordable cases for the Connected Care businesses segment decreased to 13 in 2022 (21 in 2021), mainly driven by our factories in North America.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nIn the Personal Health businesses segment, Health and Safety incidents decreased in 2022, with 7 registered LWICs, compared to 12 in 2021. The LWIC rate decreased from 0.16 in 2021 to 0.09 in 2022. There were 21 recordable cases in the Personal Health businesses segment in 2022 (18 in 2021). This increase was mainly driven by more recorded incidents in North America and less cases in the Netherlands.\n\n## Philips Foundation 13.4.7\n\nPhilips Foundation is a registered non-profit organization established in 2014 - founded as the centralized corporate social responsibility platform of Philips. Meanwhile, its mission and focus are to provide access to quality healthcare for underserved communities, looking at lasting healthcare system change to make primary healthcare accessible and affordable for underserved populations and reduce healthcare inequality. In 2022, Royal Philips supported Philips Foundation with a contribution of EUR 6.7 million and provided the Foundation's operational staff and the expert assistance of skilled Philips employees in the execution of Philips Foundation's programs.",

The Foundation is increasingly working with social entrepreneurs on innovations in the healthcare space that enable underserved communities to get medical examinations for early detection of conditions and timely referral to the right medical services. Philips Foundation fosters innovations that are fit for purpose, address local needs, are accessible and affordable, are set up for scaling, and are financially sustainable to help ensure lasting healthcare provision.\n\nSince the launch of Philips Foundation, over 300 initiatives have been completed or are in progress throughout the world - engaging employees, providing healthcare technologies and solutions, and overcoming healthcare challenges in close connection with organizations operating locally. Philips Foundation Impact Investments B.V., a subsidiary set up in 2021, invested in 8 ventures in 2022. Through its subsidiary, Philips Foundation aims to accelerate the development of potentially high-impact access-to-care opportunities and reduce healthcare inequality by nurturing early-stage social enterprises through investments and support. Selection starts with a thorough understanding of the local context and the actual needs of the end beneficiaries. In 2022, Philips Foundation's initiatives improved the lives of more than 2.2 million people and provided access to healthcare to over 26 million people in some of the most underserved regions across the globe.\n\nPhilips Foundation retains the ambition to provide access to quality healthcare for around 100 million underserved people annually by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, Philips Foundation continued its program of new and ongoing projects, mainly oriented towards the deployment of technology-based solutions, exploring and supporting scalable ways to strengthen community and primary care. With projects covering many phases of people's health journeys, Philips Foundation focused on addressing the increase in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers, improving maternal and child health, and strengthening acute and emergency care. Philips Foundation aims to relieve healthcare facilities and local health workers in underserved areas by leveraging Philips' expertise in telehealth solutions for early detection and rapid referral to the right doctor or specialist.\n\nIn 2022, Philips Foundation further built upon the expertise of Philips employees, social entrepreneurs, and other leading experts to explore innovative paths to strengthen healthcare access. Together with RAD-AID International, Philips Foundation announced a multi-year cross-continental partnership to promote access to diagnostic ultrasound services in 10 countries. The program aims to reach 50 million people by deploying hundred Philips ultrasound devices that support remote healthcare delivery for communities thousands of kilometers away. In Kenya, Philips Foundation is working with NCD Alliance and social enterprise iMedrix to develop a cardiovascular care model in primary care facilities that\n\nimproves capacity for triage, screening and testing of cardiovascular risks and facilitates treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn total, 29 new initiatives have been rolled out globally in 2022, with Philips Foundation and its subsidiary working with Philips to improve access to, and availability of, healthcare solutions for vulnerable communities.\n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, Philips Foundation has been committed to providing access to much-needed healthcare for the people in Ukraine who have limited or no access to medical services, due to the devastation. Philips Foundation has worked closely with Philips employees in Ukraine and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to provide medical devices to hospitals, mobile medical brigades, and local institutions such as maternity clinics.\n\nPhilips Foundation has also been working with local humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross and local government agencies to provide support to Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic. This includes the provision of patient monitors and handheld diagnostic ultrasound devices to assist in acute and emergency care, as well as products for child care. At Romania's border with Ukraine, Philips Foundation and the Italian Red Cross have stationed a mobile hospital ready for deployment in case of emergency.\n\nFor more information about the Philips Foundation, its purpose and scope, as well as its latest annual report, visit the website.\n\n## Supplier indicators 13.4.8\n\nPhilips' purpose to improve people's health and well-being extends throughout our value chain. At Philips, we have a direct business relationship with approximately 5,300 product and component suppliers and 17,100 service providers. Our supply chain sustainability strategy is evaluated annually through a structured process, combined with multistakeholder dialogues. From this, we have developed multiple programs aimed at driving sustainable improvement. These programs cover compliance with our policies, improvement of our suppliers' sustainability performance, our approach towards responsible sourcing of minerals, and reducing the environmental impact of our supply base.\n\n## Supplier sustainability compliance\n\nTwo core policy documents form the basis of our supplier sustainability compliance approach: the Supplier Sustainability Declaration and the Regulated Substances List.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD)\n\nThe SSD sets out the standards and behaviors Philips requires from its suppliers. The SSD is based on the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, in alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and key international human rights standards, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and",

It covers topics such as Labor, Health & Safety, Environment, Ethics, and Management Systems. This year, we made several changes to the supplier code of conduct, adding multiple expected behaviors that go beyond the RBA Code of Conduct. The RBA is the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to responsible business conduct in global supply chains. As a Regular member of the RBA, Philips is required to commit publicly to the RBA Code of Conduct and actively pursue conformance to the Code and its standards, which must be regarded as a total supply chain initiative.\n\n## Regulated Substances List (RSL)\n\nThe RSL specifies the chemical substances regulated by legislation. Suppliers are required to follow all the requirements stated in the RSL. Substances are marked as restricted or declarable.\n\nAll suppliers are required to commit to the SSD and RSL. Through integration of a Sustainability Agreement in our General Purchase Agreement, suppliers declare compliance to both the SSD and RSL. Upon request, they provide additional information and evidence.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Performance (SSP) - 'Beyond Auditing'\n\nIn 2016, Philips first piloted its 'Beyond Auditing' approach to engage suppliers on ESG matters, with a focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 a systematic approach to improve the sustainability of our supply chain\n- \u00b7 continuous improvement against a set of recognized and global references\n- \u00b7 collaboration, increased transparency, clear commitments, and ensuring suppliers meet the agreed targets\n- \u00b7 encouraging our suppliers, industry peers and cross-industry peers to adopt our approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESG statements\n\nThis systematic approach is shown in the figure below and is a high-level representation of the SSP program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirst, a set of references, international standards, and Philips requirements are used to develop the Frame of Reference, which covers management systems, environment, health & safety, business ethics, and human rights. For each, the maturity level of suppliers is identified in the Program Execution Wheel, which assesses suppliers against the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. Suppliers are then categorized through the Supplier Classification model, which differentiates on the basis of supplier maturity, resulting in supplier-specific proposals for improvement. The SSP process is monitored and adjusted through continuous feedback loops. The outcome of the SSP assessment is a supplier sustainability score ranging from 0 to 100. This score is based on supplier performance in environmental management, health & safety, business ethics, and human rights.\n\n## Supplier classification\n\nSupplier selection for the program is based on criticality. Criticality of suppliers is determined through an assessment of the supplier's associated risks and opportunities, such as strategic importance of their components, annual spend, and substitutability. In 2022, 14% of our suppliers were considered critical. After this initial assessment, the engagement strategy is tailored based on the suppliers' current performance in terms of sustainability.\n\nThere are four different engagement approaches: BiC (Best in Class), SSIP (Supplier Sustainability Improvement Plan), DIY (Do It Yourself) and PZT (Potential Zero Tolerance). The PZT status is a temporary status and requires immediate attention and action. Depending on the categorization, suppliers are engaged in different ways to improve their sustainability performance.",

If the requested additional information and evidence lead to the conclusion that there is no structural Zero Tolerance, the supplier's status will be changed and the supplier will go back to the original track in the program. If the conclusion gives rise to a structural Zero Tolerance, the supplier is required to:\n\n- \u00b7 propose a plan to mitigate and/or resolve the identified Zero Tolerance(s)\n- \u00b7 commit to structurally resolving the Zero Tolerance\n- \u00b7 provide regular updates and evidence\n- \u00b7 avoid quick-fixing\n\nPhilips defines six Zero Tolerances:\n\n- \u00b7 Fake or falsified records\n- \u00b7 Child and/or forced labor\n- \u00b7 Immediate threats to the environment\n- \u00b7 Immediate threats to worker health and safety\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with regulatory and/or Philips requirements\n- \u00b7 Workers' monthly income (covering salary for regular hours and overtime, tax deductions, social insurance) failing to meet regulatory requirements\n\nFor more details on the SSP process, refer to the SSP brochure.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## SSP 2022 performance: pro-rata improvements in %\n\n| Topics            | Policy   | Procedures   | Implementation   | Management Responsibility   | Communication   | Risk control   | Target Setting &Tracking   | Corrective action approach   | Supplier management   |\n|-------------------|----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Environment       | 3%       | 10%          | 14%              | 9%                          | 7%              | 29%            | 17%                        | 15%                          | 17%                   |\n| Health and Safety | 17%      | 22%          | 29%              | 2%                          | 9%              | 25%            | 37%                        | 23%                          | 13%                   |\n| Business Ethics   | 24%      | 19%          | 63%              | 86%                         | 42%             | 551%           | 54%                        | 141%                         | (10)%                 |\n| Human Capital     | 19%      | 27%          | 48%              | 24%                         | 13%             | 37%            | 1%                         | 14%                          | 6%                    |\n\n## Our 2022 results\n\nIn 2022, three zero tolerances were found across the following categories: health and safety, labor, and environmental impact. Two of the three cases were successfully closed in 2022. The remaining zero tolerance was found in Q4 2022 and is still pending closure.\n\nPhilips measures the impact of SSP engagements through the number of lives improved in the supply chain. This is derived from the improvements that suppliers make in their performance. To determine improvements, we calculate the pro rata change in performance from one year to the next.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Lives improved in the Supply Chain (thousands of Lives)\n\n|                                    |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lives improved in the Supply Chain |    302 |    430 |    459 |\n\nIn 2022, the overall year-on-year improvement in performance was 51% for suppliers that entered the program in 2021. The number of employees impacted at suppliers participating in the SSP program was approximately 459,000. This figure includes suppliers assessed in the last three years, for which the supplier has communicated their number of employees via the self-assessment questionnaire, which was validated during the on-site assessment. For those workers, labor conditions improved, the risk of serious injury reduced, and the negative environmental impact of suppliers was brought down. This includes the workers at suppliers of the Domestic Appliances business, for which Philips continued the sustainability engagement. For a detailed break-down of percentage improvements realized by active suppliers in the past year, by comparing the assessment in 2022 to their previous assessment, refer to the following table.",

Of the population of suppliers that entered the program in the year before 2022 and have been assessed at least once in the past three years, 249 suppliers were still active in 2022. The combined group represents 39% of our critical suppliers who are in the program.\n\nAs part of the adoption of our ESG commitments, we have set the target to improve the lives of 1 million workers in our supply chain by 2025. To achieve this, we started to ramp-up our engagement since 2021, adding a higher number of 2 nd tier suppliers due to changing risk profiles. We expect to roll out the program to additional manufacturing countries in the years to come.\n\n## Additional progress made in 2022\n\nPhilips started a collaboration with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2021, to extend the reach of its Supplier Sustainability Performance program across the wider industry - and impact lives outside of its own supply chain. From 2022, cross-industry peers can access Philips' Supplier Sustainability Performance program tools and methodologies through the RBA's Responsible Factory Initiative (RFI), which helps companies to assess and develop supply chain partners. This means Philips' industry peers around the world will now benefit from proven approaches to supplier sustainability and are enabled to make their own rapid advances. As part of the launch of the RFI program, Philips had 15 of its own suppliers join. It plans to direct more suppliers towards the RFI program in the years to come.\n\nPhilips is actively applying the latest insights in data science and machine learning methods to make the SSP program more efficient in determining the sustainability maturity of suppliers, while also increasing the effectiveness of our supplier improvement approach.\n\nIn 2022, a software tool was launched that enables prediction of suppliers' actual performance, based on a limited number of survey questions. This tool is helping us to greatly reduce the time spent on assessments. This leaves more room for Philips experts to support suppliers in their capability building, by sharing best practices and creating business cases that enable improvements.\n\nOn an annual basis, Philips experts organize quality trainings in the sustainability area for suppliers in the scope of the SSP program.\n\n## Responsible sourcing of minerals\n\nThe supply chains for minerals are long and complex. Philips does not source minerals directly from mines as there are typically 7+ tiers between end-user companies like Philips and the mines where the minerals are extracted. The extraction of minerals can take place in conflict-affected and high-risk regions, where mining is often informal and unregulated and carried out at artisanal small-scale mines (ASM). These ASMs are vulnerable to exploitation by armed groups and local traders. Within this context, there is an increased risk of severe human rights violations (forced labor, child labor or widespread sexual violence), unsafe working conditions or environmental concerns.\n\nPhilips addresses the complexities of the minerals supply chains through a continuous due diligence process, combined with active participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives to promote the responsible sourcing of minerals.\n\n## Conflict minerals due diligence\n\nEach year, Philips investigates its supply chain to identify smelters of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in its supply chain and we have committed to not purchasing raw materials, subassemblies, or supplies found to contain conflict minerals.\n\nPhilips applies collective cross-industry leverage through active engagement via the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI, formerly known as the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI)). RMI identifies smelters that can demonstrate, through an independent third-party audit, that the minerals they procure are conflict-free. In 2022, Philips continued to actively direct its supply chain towards these smelters.\n\nThe Philips Conflict Minerals Due Diligence framework, measures and outcomes are described in the Conflict Minerals Report that we file annually to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The conflict minerals report is also publicly available on Philips' website.\n\nEach year, we work with our suppliers on the quality of their due diligence reporting by setting minimum criteria for the Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates (CMRT). In addition, we strive to reduce the number of non-identified smelters. The quality of the CMRTs dropped 6 percentage points compared to the 2021 due diligence results. The number of non-listed smelters remained zero (2021: 0).",

We use cobalt predominantly in lithium-ion batteries. As part of this initiative, we engaged suppliers that provide materials containing cobalt. In 2022, we again reached a 100% response rate (2021: 100%).\n\n## Case study: Responsible Peruvian Gold\n\nWhilst legally registered and recognized by government bodies, Artisanal Small-scale Mining organizations (ASMOs) in Puno largely fail to meet the due diligence requirements of international buyers. The cause of this is the use of informal practices, poor productivity and exposure to health and safety risks including the use of mercury. For the same reason, these mines fail to receive lines of credit from formal lenders (e.g. banks), meaning they are less able to upgrade their production methods. This lack of formalization presents drawbacks, mainly that mines miss out on better terms of trade and finance, gold is at greater risk of sale into illicit markets, and that mines are less likely to pursue responsible mining practices and modern equipment, negatively impacting miners and the environment.\n\nThe Responsible Peruvian Gold (RPG) project will support target ASMOs to achieve Fairtrade certification and export Fairtrade certified gold. ASMOs will be supported to operate legally and formally, enabling them to access finance from formal lenders, uptake more responsible and productive mining practices, and access international markets on Fairtrade terms. Fairtrade (one of the world's leading certification schemes for responsible ASM) will work alongside FairCapital (a pioneering lender) and Valcambi (one of the world's largest precious metals refiners) in the delivery of project activities between 2021 and 2023.",

This hinders ASGM's ability to invest into improving their productive and sustainability performance and instead perpetuates the cycle of poverty and associated negative social and environmental impacts. ASGM's are in many instances also unable to meet due diligence expectations of international off-takers. Meeting these due diligence standards is essential for maintaining local markets and their positive contributions to development, especially in light of the heightened due diligence standards\n\nThe LVGP is working towards a service-led approach to professionalize ASGM across the Lake Victoria region. Leveraging previous work by project partners in the region, the LVGP will provide formalization support to ASMOs, ensure access to formal markets and provide access to equipment to improve production and health & safety performance, by providing capacity development and technical assistance needed to enable this transition. In parallel, the project aims to integrate responsibly produced ASM gold into electronics supply chains, aiming to match production of responsibly produced ASM gold with downstream demand for ASM gold from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).\n\n## Multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing of minerals\n\nWe believe that multi-stakeholder collaboration in the responsible sourcing of minerals is the most viable approach for addressing the complexities of minerals value chains.\n\n## European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM)\n\nPhilips is a founding partner of EPRM and has been a strategic member since its inception in May 2016. EPRM is a multi-stakeholder partnership between governments, companies, and civil society actors working toward more sustainable minerals supply chains. The goal of EPRM is to create better social and economic conditions for mine workers and local mining communities by increasing the number of mines that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nEPRM is an accompanying measure to the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation dedicated to making real change 'on the ground'. Through EPRM, Philips financially supports activities to improve responsible mining practices in mining areas in CAHRAs and shares our knowledge and practice in conducting due diligence. Since 2018, Philips has actively participated in several working groups focused on strengthening the responsible production of minerals, as well as improving responsible sourcing practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IRBC Responsible Gold Agreement\n\nIn June 2017 Philips signed the Responsible Gold Agreement, joining a coalition to work on improving international responsible business conduct across the gold value chain. Signees included goldsmiths, jewelers, recyclers, NGOs, electronics companies, trade unions, and the Dutch government. This partnership intends to bring about cooperation between companies, government, trade unions, and NGOs to prevent abuses within production chains. From September 2019, Philips represented gold and precious metal, recycling, and electronic companies in the steering committee of the Responsible Gold Agreement. The multistakeholder initiative concluded in June 2022. While not all of the initially set-out goals were met, the partnership achieved the following results:\n\n- \u00b7 A large majority of participating companies improved their due diligence approach that helps ensure responsible sourcing\n- \u00b7 Smaller participants joined forces in collective outreach to smelters, increasing the willingness to engage\n- \u00b7 An impact project was started as part of this collective, that improved the situation for Artisanal Small Mines in Uganda\n\n## Green supply chain program\n\nSince 2003, Philips has looked at ways to improve the environmental performance of its suppliers. When it comes to climate change, we have adopted a multi-pronged approach: reducing the environmental impact of our products, committing to carbon neutrality in our own operations, and engaging with our supply chain to reduce their carbon footprint. Through our partnership with the CDP supply chain program, Philips motivates its suppliers to disclose emissions, embed board responsibility on climate change, and actively work on reduction activities.\n\nIn October 2021, during COP26, Philips announced its target to have at least 50% of its suppliers (based on spend) committed to science-based targets for carbon reduction by 2025.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## % of suppliers committed to science-based targets\n\n|                                                  | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| % of suppliers committed to Science Based Target | 28%    | 41%    |\n\nWe consider suppliers to have committed to science-based targets when this is communicated via their CDP disclosures, public websites and announcements (on a Science Based Target, Net Zero Target, or equivalent), or the Science Based Targets Initiative website. Multiple activities have been deployed to support our achievement of this climate target. We consider spend to be relevant if it relates to product and component suppliers and relevant service providers, like logistics and information technology suppliers.",

In 2022, there was a response rate of 85% (2021: 87%). Part of the reason for the lower response rate is an increase in the number of invited suppliers by 62% compared to 2021. With more than 500 of our biggest suppliers included in the CDP engagement program in 2022, CDP confirmed Philips is in the top tier in terms of its supplier engagement coverage.\n\nOf the group that responded, 59% engaged in emission-reduction initiatives (2021: 61%). In addition, 47% committed to carbon emission targets (2021: 56%). Our suppliers undertook projects in 2022 that resulted in savings on carbon emissions amounting to 27 million metric tonnes CO 2 .\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Supplier response rate to CDP questionnaire\n\n| 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| 91%    | 87%    | 85%    |\n\nData-driven insights: Through accurate data insights, Philips' buyers are enabled to consider climate action in their supplier selection. In 2022, 41% of our purchases (in spend) were made at suppliers that have committed to science-based CO 2 reduction targets.\n\nCapability building : We support suppliers in advancing their company approach to climate action, offering (online) guidance that is tailored to their climate action maturity. In 2022, we further grew the offering of tailored feedback and guidance for 76% of our suppliers to support their growth in capabilities and help improve their approach.\n\nOpportunities for decarbonization: Through on-site assessments we identify energy efficiency opportunities that enable our suppliers to make cost-effective carbon reductions. Our team calculates for the supplier what the cost impact would be, and also the return. In 2022, 17 on-site assessments took place, which resulted in tailored plans for improvement.\n\n## Governance indicators 13.5\n\nIn 2020, Philips further reinforced its commitments as a purpose-driven company with the announcement of an enhanced and fully integrated approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. This section provides additional information on (some of) the Governance parameters reported in Governance, starting on page 69\n\n## General Business Principles 13.5.1\n\nIn 2022, a total of 706 concerns were reported via Philips Speak Up ( Ethics Line ) and through our network of GBP Compliance Officers, an increase of 16% year-on-year (2021: 610 concerns). This is a continuation of the year-on-year upward trend. We believe the upward\n\ntrend in reporting remains in line with our multi-year efforts to encourage our employees to express their concerns, whilst realizing that the extraordinary business conditions of the past few years make it imprudent to draw any specific conclusions from these numbers.\n\nSpecifically in 2022, we once more focused on increasing awareness on Integrity and on the importance of speaking up, taking on board the outcome of the deep-dives executed after the 2021 biennial Business Integrity Survey. As in previous years, teams around the world participated in structured dialogues with their manager, where patient safety, quality, integrity and speaking up were discussed as part of a company-wide initiative. Furthermore, over 62,000 of our employees completed their yearly General Business Principles e-learning, and more than 18,000 customer-facing colleagues participated in dedicated compliance trainings, where possible in a face-to-face format.\n\nIn percentage terms, North America remains the region with the highest case inflow (2022: 49%; 2021: 51%). The percentage increase in reports is specifically visible in EMEA, which is now responsible for 21% of all reported concerns (2021: 14%). Latin America showed a decline to 9% (2021: 14%). The APAC region remained stable at 21% (2021: 21%).\n\n## Breakdown of reported GBP concerns in number of reports Philips Group\n\n## 1)\n\n|                            | 2018   | 2019   |   2020 | 2021   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Health & Safety            | 11     | 9      |     26 | 19     | 19     |\n| Treatment of employees     | 254    | 320    |    342 | 365    | 430    |\n| - Equal and fair treatment | 63     | 55     |     52 | 31     | 53     |\n| - Employee development     | 8      | 9      |      5 | 20     | 29     |\n| - Employee privacy         | 6      | 10     |      8 | 11     | 6      |\n| - Employee relations       | 24     | 18     |     13 | 6      | 11     |\n| - Respectful treatment     | 102    | 163    |    160 | 226    | 255    |\n| - Remuneration             | 11     | 9      |     28 | 7      | 17     |\n| - Forced labor             | -      | -      |      1 | -      | -      |\n| - Conflict of interest     | -      | 1      |      6 | 7      | 9      |\n| - Working hours            | 12     | 14     |     27 | 10     | 15     |\n| - HR other                 | 28     | 41     |     42 | 47     | 35     |\n| Legal 2)                   | 49     | 33     |     28 | 30     | 48     |\n| Quality                    | 10     | 11     |     11 | 18     | 30     |\n| Business Integrity         | 96     | 138    |    127 | 112    | 114    |\n| Procurement                | 6      | 7      |     12 | 4      | 3      |\n| IT                         | 4      | 3      |      5 | 8      | 9      |\n| Other                      | 8      | 24     |     20 | 54     | 53     |\n| Total                      | 438    | 545    |    571 | 610    | 706    |",

In 2022 there were 430 reports in this category, compared to 365 in 2021. This represents 61% of the total number of concerns, slightly higher than in 2021 (60%).\n\nThe majority of the concerns reported in the 'Treatment of employees' category relate to 'Respectful treatment'. The 'Respectful treatment' sub-category generally relates to concerns about verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, and hostile work environments. In the 'Treatment of employees' category, 54% of cases originated from North America, an increase compared to 2021 (51%).\n\n## Business integrity\n\nThe second most-reported type of concern relates to 'Business Integrity', which accounted for 16% of total cases reported in 2022, down from 18% in 2021. These concerns originated primarily from the APAC region (44%), followed by the EMEA region (25%), North America (22%), and Latin America (10%).\n\n## Substantiated/unsubstantiated concerns\n\nIn 2022, a total of 672 reports were closed. Of these 672 reports, 213 were substantiated (i.e. were found to constitute a breach of our General Business Principles), which represents 32% of the cases closed in 2022 (28% in 2021). 28% of 'Treatment of employees' cases were substantiated, compared to 24% in 2021 (2020: 28%). In addition, 49% of the 'Business integrity' reports were closed as substantiated, compared to 40% in 2021 (2020: 39%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Follow-up action\n\nDepending on the outcome of the investigation, appropriate follow-up action is taken. Follow-up action can be remedial and/or disciplinary in nature. Remedial action can vary from strengthening the business processes, training and coaching, to increasing awareness of the expected standard of business conduct. Disciplinary measures may include written warnings and termination of employment. In 2022, disciplinary action was taken in 105 cases, and remedial action in 194.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement 13.5.2\n\nPhilips constantly engages in a range of activities and interactions with key stakeholders. Meaningful, effective and informed stakeholder engagement is a cornerstone to achieving the company's commitment to doing business responsibly and sustainably.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nWe look at sustainability within the overarching ESG framework of environmental responsibility, social value creation and corporate governance. Regarding its environmental responsibility, Philips focuses on making a material impact, which means prioritizing initiatives that deliver tangible value. Our strategy is in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nIn the social dimension, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) and as part of our commitment to improve 2 billion lives by 2025, Philips aims to expand access to care for 300 million people in underserved communities, both in developing and developed countries. We team up with our partners to deliver sustainable value, drive global change, reduce our shared environmental footprint and increase our social impact, in line with the UN's Sustainable\n\n## Classification of the concerns investigated in number of reports Philips Group\n\n|                        | 2020          | 2020            | 2021          | 2021            | 2022          | 2022            |\n|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Category               | substantiated | unsubstantiated | substantiated | unsubstantiated | substantiated | unsubstantiated |\n| Health & Safety        | 6             | 19              | 3             | 18              | 6             | 16              |\n| Treatment of employees | 107           | 270             | 87            | 271             | 121           | 312             |\n| Legal                  | 12            | 25              | 8             | 17              | 11            | 24              |\n| Quality                | 1             | 10              | 4             | 14              | 6             | 14              |\n| Business Integrity     | 54            | 86              | 60            | 90              | 52            | 54              |\n| Procurement            | 1             | 8               | 1             | 6               | 1             | 2               |\n| IT                     | 3             | 4               | 5             | 4               | 2             | 4               |\n| Other                  | 3             | 13              | 8             | 41              | 14            | 33              |\n| Total                  | 187           | 435             | 176           | 461             | 213           | 459             |",

The UHC2030 agenda is about ensuring that by 2030 all people can obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. This will not only improve health and health equity, it will also help reduce poverty, create jobs, drive inclusive economic growth, promote gender equality, and protect populations from epidemics. As member of the UHC2030 Private-Sector Constituency, Philips actively supports this mission.\n\nOver the past year, Philips has continued its journey to improve access to care in underserved communities. Through shared-value partnerships and dedicated teams across the company's businesses and markets, Philips is developing innovative digital solutions and deploying new business and financing models that are both sustainable and scalable, to strengthen health systems while lowering costs and bringing care closer to those most in need.\n\nUltrasound, for example, is still not sufficiently available in many rural and remote areas. So, by leveraging its expertise in mobile ultrasound services, and in close collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Philips is researching and developing AI-based applications that can assist frontline health workers to effectively capture and interpret ultrasound images.\n\n## Key collaborations enabling UHC\n\nIn 2022, Philips continued to be a Steering Committee member of the Health Finance Coalition. This coalition consists of leading health donors, investors and technical partners seeking to scale blended finance solutions to achieve SDG3 and Universal Health Coverage in Africa. As part of this coalition, Philips committed to investing in the Transform Health Fund, a USD 100 million target fund that will invest in supply chain transformation and innovative care delivery models serving low-income patients.\n\nPhilips also extended its Memorandum of Understanding with the UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. The parties commit to joining forces and improving the lives of 50 million women and children by 2025 by working together on large projects, such as in Congo Brazzaville, and developing innovative finance models.\n\nPhilips is a Commissioner at the High-Level Commission (HLC) on the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 Follow-up. The mission of the HLC is, among other things, to support acceleration of the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action by providing global guidance and advocacy to advance the 12 global Nairobi commitments, which highlight the 'three zeros'\n\n(zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal mortality, and zero sexual and gender-based violence including harmful practices).\n\nThe Partnership for Maternal and Newborn Child Health (PMNCH) continues to be an important platform for Philips in advocating for health and well-being. As the world's largest alliance for women's, children's and adolescents' health and well-being, the Partnership works across 10 constituency groups and is hosted by the World Health Organization.\n\nPhilips is also a participant in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. The UNGC calls on all companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption, and to take actions that advance societal goals. Philips is active on both global and local levels, such as through its 'Green hospital' initiative with UN Global Compact Poland, and it chairs the UN Global Compact Netherlands network.\n\nTogether with Philips Foundation and RAD-AID International, Philips is supporting the deployment of mobile ultrasound services to improve access to virtual care in hard-to-reach areas. The multi-year partnership is rolling out an intensive program in 10 countries to train a wide range of health workers and specialists through real-time distance education and simulated procedure demonstrations. The program aims to increase access to ultrasound services for 50 million people in underserved communities.\n\nIn Kenya, Philips is also working with Philips Foundation and social enterprise iMedrix, innovating at local level, to improve the continuum of cardiac care in underserved areas. For the first time, community centers in Western Kenya will be connected to the iMedrix pointof-care solution in combination with Philips' mobile ultrasound to accelerate communication between the community and healthcare facilities in the event of emergencies.\n\n## Driving circular economy\n\nAt Philips, we engage with multiple stakeholders to drive circular practices worldwide. Through active collaboration with PACE (Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy) and its Capital Equipment Coalition, representing a broad group of physical hardware products as diverse as servers, medical scanners, and chips, Philips is supporting industry, governments, and NGOs in formulating strategies for change, the development of circular metrics and assembling a coalition of like-minded companies to exchange learning and spearhead implementation and tangible progress at scale. In 2022, together with the Capital Equipment Coalition, key regulatory barriers specific to Capital Equipment were identified, including cross-border movement of systems and parts for repair, refurbishment, and recovery.",

In 2022, Philips continued its strategic partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) and joined the global call for a UN Treaty to address plastic pollution, harmonizing regulatory standards, mandating the development of national targets and action plans, defining common metrics and methodologies, and supporting innovation and infrastructure development. Philips also partners with EMF on its strategic design initiative to embed sustainable and circular design and drive systemic change across businesses.\n\nPhilips participates in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), actively contributing to the development of the Circular Transition Indicators (CTI). In 2022, Philips became an official campaign sponsor of 'Going Circular' - the global independent film documentary exploring concrete solutions that individuals and communities are using to move toward a more circular society.\n\n## Driving climate action\n\nWe already source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources, and finance projects in developing regions to compensate unavoidable emissions. Thanks to our focused approach to drive down emissions, we have been carbon-neutral in our operations since 2020. We have been developing more and more products and services that are EcoDesigned and circular-ready, optimizing the design of our products and solutions to make them more energy-efficient. But to really mitigate climate change we need to speed up our efforts and drive scale beyond our own operations. In 2022, for the 10th year in a row, Philips received the prestigious 'A List' award from global environmental impact non-profit CDP, for our efforts to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low-carbon economy.\n\nIn 2022, Philips received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative for its increased scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon-reduction goals, becoming the first health technology company to have its entire value-chain CO\u2082 emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Scope 3 is vitally important because responsible sourcing of goods and services has a positive knock-on effect within the healthcare value chain, as it also means that our customers' environmental footprint becomes smaller.\n\nPhilips started a collaboration with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2021 to extend the reach of its Supplier Sustainability Performance program across the wider industry - and impact lives outside of its supply chain. From 2022, cross-industry peers can access Philips' Supplier Sustainability Performance program tools and methodologies through the RBA's Responsible Factory Initiative, which helps companies to assess and develop supply chain partners. This means that Philips' industry peers around the world can now benefit from proven approaches to supplier sustainability and make their own rapid advances.\n\nIn 2022, Philips joined the 2040 Ambition Statement by CoZEV (Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels) to accelerate maritime shipping decarbonization and realize zero emission ocean shipping.\n\nIn 2022, we also continued to team up with key strategic stakeholders, partners and customers during high-level events and stakeholder meetings - including the World Economic Forum (WEF) virtual Annual Meeting, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, and COP27 - to scale and drive the adoption of green practices and a smooth transition to a lowcarbon and climate-resilient economy, in line with the Paris Agreement. Philips endorsed its call for climate action in an open letter from global CEOs to act, move fast and boost investment towards a net-zero world.\n\n## Advocacy towards EU stakeholders\n\nPhilips continued its engagement with EU policymakers on key topics such as: the impact of the semiconductor shortage on the medical technology sector and consequently on patients; use of Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity in healthcare; the impact of early detection of lung and prostate cancer on patients and health systems; recovery from COVID-19 and resilience of healthcare systems in general.\n\nPhilips contributed to several panel discussions and publications by EU trade associations COCIR, MedTech Europe, Digital Europe and the European Round Table for Industry (ERT). Examples include a COCIR event on resilient health systems, MedTech Europe's call for action 'Need for Prioritisation of Healthcare Capabilities', and the ERT paper 'Towards an EU Action Plan for a Digitally Enabled Green Transition'.\n\n## Global partnerships and industry research\n\nPhilips collaborates closely with a diverse international network of stakeholders to build strategic partnerships and commission industry research. Some examples are mentioned below.\n\nIn 2020, Philips joined forces with the World Economic Forum, AstraZeneca, KPMG, the London School of Economics, WHO Foundation and the Center for Asia Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI) on the Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR). Motivated by a shared commitment to improving population health, through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHSSR is committed to collaborating across sectors and borders to help build more resilient and more sustainable health systems. From new models of care to innovative financing mechanisms and breakthrough technologies, PHSSR aims to make change happen by identifying transferable solutions with the greatest potential and supporting their adoption.",

In 2022, PHSSR performed 13 country health system assessments, which were discussed with government officials and health systems leaders in expert panels, launch events and policy dialogues, as well as the virtual 2022 PHSSR Global Summit.\n\nPhilips is proud of its continued engagement as a strategic partner of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the international organization for public-private cooperation committed to improving the state of the world. The Forum engages political, business and other leaders to help shape global, regional and industry agendas.\n\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the year kicked off with a second virtual WEF Annual Meeting, during which Philips joined a livestreamed panel on ESG Metrics for a Sustainable Future along with the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan. The session had an active audience of more than 40,000 livestreaming it and by the end of the week of Davos programming, the session had been viewed over 3 million times. Global challenges amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic have made ESG issues even more pressing for policymakers, boards and executives. As one of the 54 companies that has integrated the WEF Stakeholder Capitalism metrics framework in its annual reporting, this was an important opportunity to showcase Philips' leadership in championing the framework with a global audience.\n\nThroughout 2022, Philips continued to work closely with the WEF International Business Council (IBC) to integrate the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics framework published in 2020 into ESG and sustainability reporting. This framework is a set of common metrics for companies to align their mainstream reporting on performance against ESG indicators and track their contributions towards sustainable value creation and the SDGs on a consistent basis.\n\nIn September 2022, WEF published a case study to illustrate the experiences of some of the world's largest companies as they report on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. Philips was featured alongside Heineken, SABIC and Schneider Electric, highlighting ways in which the metrics drive internal corporate transformation and create impact in the wider world. Philips has advocated for adoption across various platforms like the WEF ESG practitioners' group and the European Round Table for Industry (ERT) Sustainable Finance group and has included the framework for the second time in this 2022 Annual Report.\n\nIn May 2022, WEF held its first in-person Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland in over two years, attended by over 2,000 global leaders. Philips joined a number of high-level panels and held bilateral meetings with key business leaders, civil society representatives and public figures. In particular, Philips led discussions around the digital transformation of healthcare,\n\nsupply chain decarbonization and the impact of the global chip shortage on the medical technology sector.\n\n## Engaging with healthcare professionals and key opinion leaders: Future Health Index\n\nThe Future Health Index (FHI) is a research-based platform designed to help determine the readiness of countries to address global health challenges and build sustainable, fit-forpurpose national health systems. By examining the role of technology in the health system, the aim of FHI is to provide actionable insights to healthcare professionals, governments and patients that will also improve their experience with healthcare.\n\nThe Future Health Index 2022 report considers how healthcare leaders' priorities have shifted to navigate a changed world. Specifically, the report explores healthcare leaders reassessing their needs, unlocking the power of data, and how predictive analytics can supercharge care.\n\n## Assurance report of the independent auditor 13.6\n\nTo: the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V.\n\n## Our opinion and conclusion\n\nWe have audited the section 'Materiality analysis', the chapter 'Environmental, Social and Governance' (excluding the sections 'Remuneration policy' and 'Risk management approach') and the chapter 'ESG statements' (hereafter together: the ESG information) in the accompanying annual report for 2022 of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the company) at Eindhoven, Netherlands. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nFurthermore we have reviewed the section 'EU Taxonomy framework' as included in section '5.1 ESG reporting framework' in the annual report (hereafter: EU Taxonomy information). A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance.\n\nIn our opinion, the ESG information presents, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:\n\n- \u00b7 the policy and business operations with regard to ESG; and\n- \u00b7 the thereto related events and achievements in 2022\n\nin accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section 'Reporting criteria'.",

Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the ESG information and the review of the EU Taxonomy information' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of Koninklijke Philips N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence). This includes that we do not perform any activities that could result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion and conclusion.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the ESG information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in section 'Approach to ESG reporting' of the annual report.\n\nThe ESG information is prepared with reference to the GRI Standards. The GRI Standards used are listed in the GRI Content Index as published on the company's website.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the EU Taxonomy information is the Regulation (EU) 2020/ 852 as supplemented with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure ESG information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the ESG information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.\n\n## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant part of the ESG information and EU Taxonomy information; and for the ESG information and EU Taxonomy information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the company.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the audit and the review and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Unreviewed corresponding EU Taxonomy information\n\nNo review has been performed on the EU Taxonomy information for the period 2021. Consequently, the corresponding EU Taxonomy information and thereto related disclosures for the period 2021 is not reviewed.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our review and our audit\n\nThe ESG information and EU Taxonomy information include prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates. Inherent to this prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the ESG information and EU Taxonomy information.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the ESG information, excluding the Methodology for calculating Lives improved, version 2022 (Lives improved methodology), the Methodology for calculating the Environmental Profit & Loss Account, version 2022 (EPL methodology) and the GRI content index, are not part of the ESG information as audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\nOur opinion and conclusion are not modified in respect to these matters.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the ESG information and EU Taxonomy information\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate ESG information and EU Taxonomy information in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section 'Reporting criteria', including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The Board of Management is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into",

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nOur review of the EU Taxonomy information is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of information and vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in a review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
