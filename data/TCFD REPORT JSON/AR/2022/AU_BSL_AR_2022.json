This performance was a great tribute to our clear strategy, disciplined financial framework and the operating leverage of our diverse portfolio.\n\nThe strong performance of your Company allows it to simultaneously invest for a low carbon future, long term sustainable earnings, and to increase shareholder returns. Notably, during FY2022, nearly $1 billion was returned to shareholders, $1 billion invested in acquisitions to build our US growth platform and further capital was invested in other growth projects, such as the North Star expansion.\n\nWith strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet, BlueScope is very well positioned to continue to grow and deliver value.\n\nThe Board of Directors and I extend thanks and respect to our expanded team of over 15,000 people across all 18 countries who have tirelessly served customers and communities, and supported each other's health and wellbeing, amidst exceptional demand for our products and interruptions to supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50\n\nCPS\n\nFY2022 DIVIDENDS (UNFRANKED)\n\n## Safety\n\nAs always, safety comes first at BlueScope. Over the last year, we've continued to evolve our overall approach and organisation wide safety culture as we seek to take our performance to the next level. This is about supporting our leaders and empowering our people to increase our capacity in how we manage risk.\n\nIn FY2022, strong performance was observed on our lead indicators, with a stable result on our lag indicators against a challenging operating environment during the year with sustained pandemic impacts, labour shortages, strong demand, execution of major projects and the growth of our overall workforce.\n\nDuring the year, BlueScope proudly achieved worldsteel Sustainability Champion status, and was also named a joint winner of worldsteel's Safety and Health Excellence Recognition in Leadership and Culture for our HSE Evolution leadership, risk and culture program.\n\n## Rewarding shareholders\n\nA core part of BlueScope's Financial Framework is balancing the competition between capital for growth initiatives and returns to shareholders.\n\nThe Company returned just under $1 billion to shareholders in FY2022, another record in BlueScope's 20-year history. This was comprised of $344 million in dividends and $638 million in on-market buy-backs 1 .\n\nThe Board has approved a final unfranked dividend of 25 cents per share. Additionally, the share buy-back program is being increased to allow up to a further $500 million to be bought over the next 12 months.\n\nHaving exhausted Australian tax losses in FY2022, we expect to be able to begin to frank dividends in FY2023 2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2022 ON MARKET BUY-BACK\n\n$638",

The first coil was produced in June 2022, and we are commencing the 18 month ramp up to full run rate, at which point North Star will account for around 5% of total annual US flat steelmaking production. We have grown significantly in a short space of time, and despite the COVID pandemic. Our growth ambitions continue and we will now begin to assess a low capital cost hot strip mill debottlenecking opportunity at North Star, targeting a further 500,000 tonnes per annum of incremental steel production.\n\nIn December, BlueScope established BlueScope Recycling and Materials, or BRM, by acquiring the ferrous scrap steel recycling business of MetalX in Waterloo, Indiana and in Delta, Ohio, for approximately US$220 million. In August, a third ferrous scrap processing site was acquired. BRM gives us a crucial presence and expertise in scrap processing. The new business unit will enable North Star to improve the quality and quantity of obsolete scrap it uses and reduce the mix of higher cost, prime scrap.\n\nIn June, BlueScope established a significant national painting footprint in the US with the $717 million acquisition of the Coil Coatings business from Cornerstone Building Brands. Now named BlueScope Coated Products, or BCP, the business is the second largest metal coil painter in the US, with around 900,000 metric tonnes of annual painting capacity.\n\nBCP's 570-strong team operates seven sites, painting a range of finishes on steel and aluminium substrates for a wide range of applications, including building products and manufactured goods, as well as offering a range of valueadded services. The business has a history of robust financial performance, with a sales mix focussed on US enduse segments that are attractive to BlueScope.\n\nBCP provides BlueScope with immediate access to the large and growing Eastern US region, along with a longer-term opportunity to further integrate our US flat steel value-chain. We expect near-term synergies, but we also see significant potential for medium to longer term growth through product development and branded products, consistent with our customer service and value proposition elsewhere in the portfolio.\n\nAltogether, BlueScope's total investment in the US is now around $5 billion, with nearly 4,000 employees. The business network that we have assembled forms the exceptional backbone of our US value chain and is well positioned for future growth.\n\n$3.79 BN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n41.6 %\n\nUNDERLYING PRE-TAX ROIC\n\n## Our vision for Port Kembla\n\nAs the Port Kembla Steelworks approaches its 100-year anniversary in 2028, we are looking towards its low-carbon, modern manufacturing future.\n\nWe are continuing to invest in robotics, automation and other digital technologies to deliver the next wave of customer, growth and productivity improvements. These digital technologies will also support a range of carbon intensity reduction initiatives, such as the now operational blast furnace digital twin model.\n\nWe are working hard to optimise our existing operating assets and are exploring a range of opportunities to reduce their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions intensity. This includes further increasing our use of scrap, the more efficient use of indigenous gases, the potential for injecting hydrogen-rich coke ovens gas into the blast furnace, trials of biomass injection into the blast furnace and a range of offgas heat and energy reuse opportunities. We are also pursuing breakthrough decarbonisation technology with continued progression of the assessment of a pilot hydrogenbased direct reduced iron melter and a hydrogen electrolyser. During FY2022, we established BlueScopeX\u2122, our fund for direct investment in start-ups and innovations in decarbonisation and energy efficient buildings.\n\nThe feasibility study of the comprehensive reline and upgrade of the mothballed No.6 Blast Furnace is progressing well. This project includes a range of improved environmental controls, along with technology options that will enable incremental greenhouse gas intensity reductions. Importantly, our planning for the reline builds a bridge to future adoption of breakthrough lower emissions steelmaking, once it is technically and commercially viable.\n\nAs part of planning for the next 100 years in the Illawarra, BlueScope has commenced the development of a Master Plan for approximately 200 hectares of excess landholdings adjacent to the Port Kembla Steelworks. This 18 month program will be led by world-leading architects and urban designers, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), and will create a vision for the reimagination and transformation of land surplus to steelmaking needs, with the potential to unlock a wide range of new uses and enable significant long-term economic and social value for the region.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nWe continued to make progress in addressing climate change through the year. We released our first Climate Action Report, with expanded targets and our longer term 2050 net zero goal 1 . In addition to our work towards future steelmaking at Port Kembla, we have further developed decarbonisation plans for our New Zealand steelmaking facility, where we are actively evaluating our technology options.\n\nIn the nearer term, our steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target with a total 3.6 per cent reduction since FY2018. Midstream emissions intensity has decreased 3.7 per cent overall since FY2018, however increased in FY2022 on lower despatch volumes due to supply chain constraints and disruptions.\n\nPleasingly, the Port Kembla site achieved ResponsibleSteel\u2122 certification in February, being the first steelmaker in Asia Pacific and the fourth site to be certified globally. The standard defines the performance expectations for responsible sourcing and production of steel, and this achievement is a key point of differentiation for the Steelworks.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nWith more than half our revenues and earnings now coming from our international portfolio beyond our traditional markets of Australia and New Zealand, it is important that our Board better reflects all the regions in which we operate, and in which we will continue to invest and grow.\n\nAccordingly, in January we welcomed two new independent non-executive Directors from outside Australia. Ms K'Lynne Johnson, based in the US, brings extensive experience in the areas of technological led transformation, sustainability, renewables, human resources, customers and innovation, together with traditional high capital-intensive sector experience. Ms Johnson is on the Boards of two companies listed on the NYSE, and her previous executive roles include in the specialty and commodity chemicals industry for over 28 years, including most recently as President and Chief Executive Officer of Elevance Renewable Sciences and as Senior Vice President of global derivatives with BP Chemicals.\n\nMr ZhiQiang Zhang is based in China and has a background in blue-chip manufacturing and product development, including industrial digitisation, automation and robotics. With deep sector knowledge in automotive, machine tools, steel making, foundry, telecommunications and infrastructure, he brings a deep understanding of the China and broader Asian markets, and insight into areas of innovation and growth. His senior executive business and leadership experience includes over 25 years at Siemens, with his last role as President & Chief Executive Officer, Greater China Region, Nokia Siemens Networks, and more recently as Group Senior Vice President & President ABB China for ABB ASEA Brown Boveri.\n\nIn May, Mr Mark Hutchinson resigned from the Board to take up an executive position with another organisation. I thank him for his contribution to the Board and as Chair of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile BlueScope has continued to see favourable macroeconomic and industry trends over the last year, the Company's record performance reflects not only the success of its strategy at work, but particularly the unwavering dedication and resilience of the whole BlueScope team in what have been quite extraordinary markets and operating conditions.\n\nI also wish to thank our customers, our shareholders and my fellow Directors for their support.\n\nLooking forward to the immediate term, in 1H FY2023, the Company expects underlying EBIT to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, driven particularly by significantly lower Midwest US HRC steel spreads and weaker Asian HRC steel spreads.\n\nThese expectations are subject to spread, foreign exchange and market conditions.\n\nWe will provide a further update on trading conditions at our Annual General Meeting on 22 November 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Bevan\n\nChairman",

This 18 month program will be led by world-leading architects and urban designers, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), and will create a vision for the reimagination and transformation of land surplus to steelmaking needs, with the potential to unlock a wide range of new uses and enable significant long-term economic and social value for the region.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Progress\n\n## Safety\n\nBlueScope is continuing to evolve its approach to safety, by building capacity and driving a greater a focus on engagement and learning. This is based on the acknowledgement that humans make mistakes and our ability to tolerate these errors and have resilience to recover when things do go wrong lies in strengthening our controls. Across our business, BlueScope is implementing innovative and practical risk control improvements to enhance resilience, whilst empowering all people who make and handle our products to identify opportunities and be part of the solution.\n\nIn FY2022, BlueScope employees completed over 243 teambased Health, Safety and Environment risk control improvement projects. 1,372 leaders have now participated in the safety HSE risk management program, with 112 of BlueScope's supply chain and industry partners also participating through the year. The program was recognised by the World Steel Association, being awarded the winner of their Safety and Health Excellence Recognition in 2021 for Leadership and Culture.\n\nAt 7.1, the lagging injury metric TRIFR remains slightly above the long-term range of 5-7. The FY2022 injury profile continues to be lower severity injuries (e.g. sprains, lacerations), with 2.5% of injuries having had the potential to be a fatal incident, one of which unfortunately resulted in a permanent incapacity. These figures are a stable result on our lag indicators, against a challenging operating environment during the year with sustained pandemic impacts, labour shortages, strong demand, execution of major projects and the growth of our overall workforce.\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain\n\nBlueScope seeks to foster responsible business practices and uphold human rights through engagement, risk assessment and improvement activities, and endeavours to partner with suppliers who share our core values.\n\nBlueScope has completed the Engage and Assess process with 308 suppliers since the start of our responsible sourcing program in late FY2019. 139 assessments were completed during FY2022, which is a mix of new supplier assessments and some re-assessments. Over 80% of these were completed using the independent EcoVadis assessment process. No on-site assessments were completed during FY2022 due to pandemic related disruptions to travel and site access.\n\nBlueScope's new Supply Chain Sustainability Manager commenced in February 2022, reporting to the Head of Group Procurement. The team continued to actively contribute to development of the Responsible Sourcing requirements for the new ResponsibleSteel\u2122 standard for 'Certified Steel', and continued engagement on behalf of BlueScope with Be Slavery Free as a Business Association member and the UN Global Compact Network Australia as a signatory.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nBlueScope continued to make progress in addressing climate change through the financial year 1 . Steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target with a 3.6% reduction since FY2018. Midstream emissions intensity has decreased 3.7% overall since FY2018, however increased in FY2022 on lower despatch volumes due to supply chain constraints and disruptions. During FY2022, we further developed decarbonisation plans for our New Zealand steelmaking facility, where we are actively evaluating our technology options, and at North Star, we're continuing to explore opportunities for supply of renewable electricity.\n\nBlueScope is making progress on a range of projects to both optimise existing operating assets, as well as investigate and prepare for emerging and breakthrough technology. At Port Kembla, projects under investigation include a scrap melter, blast furnace injection of hydrogen-rich coke ovens gas or biomass, and digital twin technology.\n\nThe Company is also progressing its assessment of a hydrogen electrolyser and a hydrogen hub in the Illawarra. BlueScope is continuing to work with a range of industry and research organisations on our plans, noting that Shell will now pursue its involvement in this project as a supporting partner rather than lead partner.\n\n## Inclusion, Diversity and Social Impact\n\nBlueScope continues to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which it operates and is working to drive positive social impact.\n\nFemale representation continues to grow in pursuit of our 40:40:20 target, with the total percentage of women in the BlueScope workforce reaching 24% in FY2022. Recruitment and retention have been challenging due to low unemployment, high job vacancies (particularly in the US) and pandemic related impacts across the BlueScope footprint. Beyond gender strategies are emerging from our business units and are designed to suit local community needs - such as a focus on ethnicity in the US, for example, Buildings North America achieved ethnically diverse recruitment of 41% for all new hires in FY2022.\n\nAlso, in FY2022, a human rights impact assessment was completed for BlueScope's operations, which has informed the priority focus areas to be hours of work, wages and benefits, forced labour, harassment and abuse and grievance mechanisms. A Social Impact steering committee has been established to oversee the due diligence process, to track actions and to mitigate any potential adverse impacts. First Nations engagement in Australia and New Zealand is one way we will deliver positive social impact and continue to recognise the importance of the diverse cultural heritage in our communities.",

The revised facilities deliver lower cost and longer tenor, with three to five-year maturities at establishment.\n\nNet finance costs decreased by $3.8M largely due to lower commitment fees on the reduced size and margin of the bilateral revolving facilities and higher interest income.\n\nFinancial liquidity was $3,116.6M at 30 June 2022 ($3,371.2M at 31 December 2021), comprised of $1,433.9M committed undrawn bank debt capacity and $1,682.7M cash. Liquidity in the NS BlueScope Coated Products JV was $628.3M, which is included in the Group liquidity measure.\n\n## Tax\n\nFY2022 tax expense of $806.7M (FY2021 $388.1M), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 21.5% (FY2021 23.2%),",

        "page_content": "was impacted by higher profit, offset by lower tax rates in North America and Asia and the utilisation of unrecognised tax losses and timing differences in New Zealand. In addition, due to a sustainable return to taxable profits, the Group has fully recognised New Zealand's remaining tax losses ($27.9M tax effected).\n\nThe BlueScope Australian consolidated tax group had consumed all the previously carried forward tax losses by 30 June 2022. Given this, we expect to be able to begin to frank dividends in FY2023 1 .\n\n## Dividend and Capital Management\n\nDuring FY2022, BlueScope paid an unfranked final ordinary dividend in respect of FY2021 of 25.0 cents per share (8.0 cents per share in 1H FY2021), an unfranked special dividend of 19.0 cents per share and an unfranked interim ordinary dividend of 25.0 cents per share.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved the payment of a final ordinary dividend of 25.0 cents per share (25.0 cents in FY2021). The final dividend will be unfranked for Australian and New Zealand tax purposes and is declared to be conduit foreign income. BlueScope's dividend reinvestment plan will not be active for the final dividend.\n\nRelevant dates for the final dividend are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Ex-dividend share trading commences: 6 September 2022.\n- \u00b7 Record date for dividend: 7 September 2022.\n- \u00b7 Payment of dividend: 12 October 2022.\n\n## Buy-back:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company will continue to use on-market share buybacks to supplement the payment of consistent dividends.\n- \u00b7 Buy-backs are attractive given the flexibility they provide in managing BlueScope's capital and for the EPS enhancement they can deliver.\n- \u00b7 In August 2021, the Board approved an on-market buyback of up to $500M to be conducted over the subsequent 12 months; $285M was spent up to 31 December 2021. In February 2022, the board approved an increase in the scale of the buy-back program to allow up to a further $700M to be spent over the next 12 months; $353M was spent between then and 30 June 2022.\n\nBlueScope's capital management policy:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group pursues a returns-focussed process with disciplined competition for capital that balances annual shareholder returns and long-term profitable growth.\n- \u00b7 Having regard to the above, the current policy is to distribute at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of consistent dividends and buy-backs.\n- \u00b7 In the short to medium term, BlueScope will retain balance sheet capacity to fund investment for growth and major projects.\n- \u00b7 In the longer term, BlueScope will continue to target around $400M net debt.\n\n## Financial Position\n\nNet assets increased $2,287.7M to $10,448.1M at 30 June 2022 from $8,160.4M at 30 June 2021. Net assets were higher as a result of foreign exchange translation (approximately $350M) primarily as a result of a weaker A$:US$. This was complemented by an increase in net assets in their functional currency. Significant movements in underlying currency were:\n\n- \u00b7 $1,301M increase in inventories due to higher volumes and rates\n- \u00b7 $861M increase in intangible assets, mainly goodwill associated with the acquisition of the ferrous scrap steel recycling business of MetalX and the Coil Coatings business\n- \u00b7 $554M increase in property, plant and equipment, including assets associated with the acquired businesses and the North Star expansion project\n- \u00b7 $449M increase in receivables, mainly due to higher sales prices\n- \u00b7 Partly offset by a $429M decrease in net cash due to net cash flow during the period, $379M increase in payables due to higher volumes and rates, $249M increase in deferred tax liabilities including consumption of tax losses in Australia and lower provisions of $227M.\n- \u00b7 The Board has today approved an increase in the scale of the buy-back program to allow up to a further $500M 2 to be bought over the next 12 months. This balances shareholder returns and our ongoing investment program. The timing and value of stock purchased will be dependent on the prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.",

The significant lift in activity has been supported by several factors, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Targeted campaigns focused on consumers, builders and fabricators particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas.\n- \u00b7 In new detached housing, record residential approvals lifted demand across the sector, supported by government stimulus measures (including the Federal Government's 'HomeBuilder' program), improved credit availability together with record low interest rates and a solid economic recovery. Commencements were impacted by weather, material and labour availability and other supply chain disruptions, which has supported a strong pipeline of work.\n- \u00b7 Strength in activity across the alterations and additions segment continued, supported by pandemic induced redirected discretionary spend, government stimulus measures, rising house prices and the surge in demand for regional housing.\n- \u00b7 Activity in the residential construction segment has however been impacted by significant material and\n- labour shortages. These disruptions, combined with the strong pipeline of work, are expected to see demand into this segment remain elevated through the course of 1H FY2023.\n\nSales into non-residential construction stabilised at strong levels in FY2022 compared to FY2021.\n\n- \u00b7 The Social and Institutional sub-segment continues to be supported by government investment in health, education and defence projects, particularly for steel intensive products.\n- \u00b7 The robust pipeline of projects across the Commercial and Industrial sub-segment from prior to the pandemic continues to support demand, with easing restrictions further enhancing sentiment across all sectors. In particular, this sub-segment continued to see strong demand for new warehousing investment supported by the shift towards e-commerce during the pandemic period.\n\nSales into the engineering and mining sectors remained stable during FY2022 compared with FY2021, with the national infrastructure plan driving ongoing activity in roads and rail together with a rebound in mining and consumables.\n\nDemand in the agriculture segment improved in FY2022 compared with FY2021, supported by the continued rebuild program following the 2020 bushfires and improved growing conditions more broadly.\n\nDemand in the manufacturing sector increased during FY2022 compared with FY2021 due to increased economic activity, particularly in residential construction, and limited availability of steel intensive competing finished goods.\n\n## Export sales\n\nDespatches to export customers in FY2022 were 9% lower than FY2021, driven by the prioritisation of domestic despatches. Export prices were higher in FY2022 than the prior corresponding period due to higher global steel prices, with pricing into North America especially strong during 1H FY2022.\n\n## Export coke sales\n\nIn FY2022, despatch volumes were 655kt, down 3% on FY2021 due to timing of shipments. Margins were stronger during FY2022 on strong global demand driving stronger coke prices relative to coal costs .",

        "page_content": "## North Star\n\nEstablished in 1996 in Delta, Ohio, North Star is one of the most efficient steel mills in North America. Presently, around two million tonnes of hot rolled coil are produced annually from North Star's electric arc furnaces, using scrap metal, pig iron and alloys.\n\nConstruction of the expansion project to add capacity of 850,000 tonnes per annum is substantially complete. The first coil was produced in June 2022, and we are commencing the 18 month ramp up to full run rate.\n\nNorth Star is consistently rated as one of the top producers of flat rolled steel in North America in the annual Jacobson Survey of steel customers measuring customer satisfaction.\n\nNorth Star sells approximately 90% of its production in the Midwest US, with its end customer segment mix being broadly 50% automotive, 35% construction, 10% manufacturing/industrial and 5% agricultural.\n\nThis segment also includes BlueScope Recycling and Materials (BRM), a full-service, ferrous scrap metal recycler with three processing facilities in North Star's region.\n\n## Financial Performance FY2022 vs. FY2021\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $2,116.8M increase in sales revenue was primarily due to significantly higher realised selling prices, driven by record Midwest benchmark hot rolled coil prices.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $1,222.9M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to higher realised steel spreads, driven by stronger regional steel prices, partly offset by elevated raw materials including scrap, pig iron, alloys and additives. Conversion costs were also higher during FY2022 driven by utilities, refractories and labour, including higher remuneration expense linked to financial performance.\n\nUnderlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in tables 12 and 13.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC increased to 66.7% driven by higher EBIT, partially offset by higher net operating assets. Net operating assets at 30 June 2022 were $945.2M higher than at 30 June 2021, primarily due to the impact of higher fixed assets as a result of the expansion project and acquisition of the ferrous scrap steel recycling business of MetalX, combined with higher inventory.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\nTable 5: Segment performance in US$M\n\n| $M              | FY2022   | FY2021   | Var %   | 2H  FY2022   |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales revenue   | 4,494.5  | 2,377.7  | 89%     | 2,058.0      |\n| Reported EBIT   | 1,887.5  | 674.5    | 180%    | 665.9        |\n| Underlying EBIT | 1,900.1  | 677.2    | 181%    | 671.6        |\n| NOA (pre-tax)   | 3,319.5  | 2,374.3  | 40%     | 3,319.5      |\n| ROIC (LTM)      | 66.7%    | 31.6%    | +35.1%  | 66.7%        |\n| Despatches (kt) | 2,043.0  | 2,083.1  | (2%)    | 1,027.0      |\n\nTable 4: Segment performance\n\n| US$M          | FY2022   | FY2021   | Var %   | 2H  FY2022   |\n|---------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales revenue | 3,259.6  | 1,796.6  | 81%     | 1,477.2      |\n| Und. EBITDA   | 1,446.9  | 567.5    | 155%    | 521.6        |\n\n## Sales and Operations\n\nStrong production and despatch levels continued throughout FY2022 - with North Star dispatching at full capacity through the year, other than during scheduled maintenance outages in November 2021 and March and April 2022.\n\nWhilst US automotive sales were impacted by semiconductor shortages, construction spending remained strong, with other sectors largely returning to pre-COVID levels.\n\nBenchmark Midwest steel prices reached record levels during FY2022, aided by strong demand and rationalised production capacity. Having hit record levels in 1H FY2022, benchmark Midwest HRC prices softened in the second half of the financial year but remained above long-term averages. Realised spreads were stronger during FY2022, but softer than benchmark spot spreads, noting specific sales mix relative to benchmark. 1\n\nIn December 2021 BlueScope Recycling was established through the acquisition of the ferrous scrap steel recycling business of MetalX. During 2H FY2022, progress was made on integrating the assets into the broader BlueScope Group whilst continuing to provide a source of scrap to the North Star electric arc furnace operations.\n\nIn August 2022, BlueScope acquired an additional ferrous scrap processing business in Ohio, USA for approximately US$80M.\n\nNorth Star has recently entered into a multi-year contract with Cleveland-Cliffs for the supply of hot briquetted iron from Cliffs' Toledo HBI plant as part of North Star's diversified metallics supply arrangements.",

Both are 50/50 joint ventures, with BlueScope controlling and therefore consolidating the joint venture with NSC, and jointly controlling and therefore equity accounting the joint venture with Tata Steel.\n\nBuilding Products' China businesses are wholly owned by BlueScope and are comprised of metal coating, painting and Lysaght operations, and Engineered Buildings Solutions (EBS).\n\n## Financial Performance FY2022 vs. FY2021\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $1,165.3M increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher regional selling prices.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $85.4M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to higher selling prices, partially offset by rising raw material and other costs:\n\n- \u00b7 North America: FY2022 underlying EBIT of $253.4M, a significant increase compared to $138.5M in FY2021. The increase was due to cyclical margin expansion driven by relatively lower steel feed costs in a rapidly rising price environment, partly offset by higher costs.\n- \u00b7 ASEAN: delivered an underlying EBIT of $85.7M in FY2022, compared to $114.5M in FY2021. This was driven by lower despatch volumes, particularly due to pandemic related impacts in Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n- \u00b7 China: delivered an underlying EBIT of $63.3M in FY2022, compared to $62.6M in FY2021, with higher volumes offset by lower margins.\n- \u00b7 India : the TBSL joint venture delivered FY2022 underlying EBIT of $72.8M (100% basis), compared to $68.9M in FY2021, mainly driven by higher margins.\n\nUnderlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in tables 12 and 13.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC increased to 26.2% driven by higher EBIT, partially offset by higher net operating assets.

Underlying demand remained strong, particularly in building and construction, which was supported by the strong economic recovery and government stimulus programs. Given the strong rise in benchmark North American steel prices, somewhat more stable feed costs, and the length of the supply chain, the business saw cyclical margin expansion during the year. Various customer-centric strategic initiatives are ongoing, with a focus on the growth of the design solution product and service offering.\n\nASC Profiles (building components) also saw strong demand and margins in its key sectors, primarily in the decking segment.\n\n## ASEAN\n\nFY2022 sales volumes across the ASEAN business decreased by 10% from FY2021 due to pandemic related",

The business continues to grow the retail channel through the Authorised Dealer network and with a greater focus on alternative distribution channels in some segments.\n\nCost and productivity improvement programs continue to deliver incremental benefits, and the business is now balancing robust cost discipline to address high inflationary environment and investment in future growth.\n\nGiven sustained improvement in the performance of the Thailand business and increased confidence in future cash flow generation, a full reversal ($46.0M pre-tax) of previously impaired plant and equipment at Thailand has been recognised in the accounts at 30 June 2022.\n\nDuring 2H FY2022, employees, customers and suppliers were informed that Lysaght Myanmar will cease operations by 30 September 2022. An impairment of fixed assets and provision for other closure costs of $8.7M (pre-tax) has also been recognised at 30 June 2022.\n\n## China\n\nAfter a strong start to calendar year 2021, China's economic momentum slowed in 1H FY2022 due to a slowing of infrastructure investment, power outages and tightening borrowing requirements for property developers. In 2H FY2022, economic activity showed signs of stability with robust investment growth in the early months of the half, however the March 2022 re-emergence of COVID and subsequent government lockdowns posed challenges to economic growth for the remainder of the half.\n\nDespite this macroeconomic environment, BlueScope China demonstrated resilience and continued to deliver growth. Total despatch volumes across the China business increased 22% in FY2022 compared to FY2021. The business saw\n\nparticularly strong demand for pre-engineered buildings servicing the growing electric vehicle end-use segment.\n\nButler and Lysaght volumes remained robust during FY2022, supported by the continuation of the business's strategy targeting premium high-growth segments including automotive, advanced manufacturing, chemicals, healthcare and electronics.\n\nCoated China despatch volumes of 198kt increased marginally on FY2021, supported by robust demand from the owned downstream channel. The ongoing successful promotion of Next Generation ZINCALUME \u00ae steel continued to position the business as a premium supplier of coated steel during the year.\n\n## India\n\nOverall despatch volumes increased marginally in FY2022 as compared to FY2021. Volumes were constrained in FY2022 by an extended maintenance outage on the metal coating line along with a 15% export duty imposed on steel exports by the Government of India in May 2022 which disrupted local market dynamics.\n\nBlueScope has reached in principle agreement with Tata Steel for the supply of coated and painted product from Tata Steel to TBSL. The product will be supplied from Tata Steel's plants located at Angul and Khopoli which were formerly part of the Bhushan Steel group. Supply of seeding units started in May 2022.\n\nTable 7: India performance\n\n| $M                                  | FY2022                            | FY2021                            | Var %                             | 2H  FY2022                        |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tata BlueScope Steel (100% basis)   | Tata BlueScope Steel (100% basis) | Tata BlueScope Steel (100% basis) | Tata BlueScope Steel (100% basis) | Tata BlueScope Steel (100% basis) |\n| Sales revenue                       | 547.8                             | 403.3                             | 36%                               | 297.1                             |\n| Underlying EBIT                     | 72.8                              | 68.9                              | 6%                                | 38.2                              |\n| Underlying NPAT                     | 58.0                              | 52.5                              | 10%                               | 30.9                              |\n| Despatches (kt)                     | 255.5                             | 253.5                             | 1%                                | 136.4                             |\n| BlueScope share (50% basis)         | BlueScope share (50% basis)       | BlueScope share (50% basis)       | BlueScope share (50% basis)       | BlueScope share (50% basis)       |\n| Underlying equity  accounted profit | 29.3                              | 26.6                              | 10%                               | 15.6                              |",

The business also sources both ferro and nitrided vanadium as inputs into the steelmaking process (mainly for rebar strengthening purposes) which has the effect of dampening any price related increase in vanadium slag contribution.\n\nThe FY2022 net vanadium contribution was approximately $4.9M higher than FY2021. This was primarily due to improved global index pricing.\n\n## NZ Pension Fund\n\nDuring the year, the New Zealand Steel Pension Fund offered two lump-sum payments:\n\n- \u00b7 The first offer to the pensioner members of the fund resulted in a 54% acceptance (by number of pensioners) and a NZ$174M payout of their actuarially determined benefits from the fund assets.\n- \u00b7 The second offer to the employee members of the fund resulted in a 36% acceptance (by number of employees) and a NZ$64M payout of their actuarially determined benefits from the fund assets.\n\nWhilst there was no settlement gain or loss recorded in the fund itself, as the benefit payments made were equal to the entitlements, a net settlement gain of NZ$38.0M, including the uplift for 33% contributions tax, has been recorded in the BlueScope Group accounts. This accounting gain arises because the AASB 119 Employee Benefits accounting liability is higher than the benefit payments made as the accounting liability is required to be discounted at the New Zealand Government bond rate, which is lower than the expected return on the fund's assets.\n\nAn additional NZ$60M cash contribution (including contribution tax) was paid by BlueScope to the fund prior to 30 June 2022 with a further cash contribution and tax payment in early 1H FY2023 totalling NZ$25M.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Future Prospects and Risks\n\nBlueScope operates in markets which are impacted by economic cycles and short-term volatility which can affect the Group's financial performance and financial outcomes both positively and negatively. On the negative side, periods of slower demand for its products, lower global commodity steel prices relative to raw material costs, and unfavourable exchange rate movements, in particular a stronger Australian dollar relative to the US dollar, are some of the macroeconomic factors to which the Group is exposed.\n\nChallenges arising from the pandemic have persisted and are expected to continue for some time, including operational continuity risks associated with maintaining pandemic safe work practices and disruptions to logistics and our supply chains. The pandemic has demonstrated the resilience of BlueScope's business model and its ability to manage key risks.\n\nThe global economy, and in particular North America, Australia and New Zealand, recovered faster and stronger than anticipated from the economic impact of the pandemic with favourable demand and macroeconomic conditions in FY2022. The price, cost and demand for BlueScope's products are uncertain and the Group considers a range of recognised external forecasters when assessing possible future market conditions. These external forecasters expect commodity steel prices to have peaked in FY2022 and are forecasting them to decline to levels broadly in line with historical long-term average by FY2026. In addition, demand for BlueScope's products is expected to moderate but remain relatively strong in Australia and New Zealand, continue to support full utilisation of pre-existing steelmaking capacity in North America (together with a ramp-up in capacity from the North Star expansion project over the next two years) and continue to grow from the FY2022 levels in Asia over the next three years.\n\nNotwithstanding the positive economic environment in FY2022 for BlueScope's products, persistent macroeconomic and market risk factors going forward include:\n\n- a.  Economic downturn or weaker economic conditions.\n- A deep or prolonged economic downturn in developed economies, or significantly slower growth in emerging economies, could have a material adverse effect on the global steel industry which may affect demand for the Group's products and financial prospects. Accelerating inflation and rising interest rates could dampen the post pandemic recovery or lead to an overcorrection and recession. These factors may also impact our ability to contain future costs, primarily energy and wages, and more broadly have implications for the demand and price of our products.\n- b.  A significant cyclical or permanent downturn in the industries to which the Group supplies its products.\n- The Group's financial prospects are sensitive to the level of activity in a number of industries, principally the building, construction and manufacturing industries. These industries are cyclical in nature, with the timing, extent and duration of these economic cycles unpredictable. While a large proportion of the Group's cost base varies with production volumes, many are fixed\n- and the Group may not readily be able to reduce its costs in proportion to an economic downturn and therefore any significant, extended or permanent downturn could negatively affect the Group's financial prospects.\n- c.  Declines in the price of steel, or any significant and sustained increase in the price of raw materials in the absence of corresponding steel price increases.\n- The Group's financial prospects are sensitive to the longterm price trajectory of international steel products and key raw material prices. A significant and sustained increase in the price of raw materials, in particular iron ore, coking coal, pig iron and scrap, with no corresponding increase in steel prices, would have an adverse impact on the Group's financial prospects, as would a decline in the price of steel with no corresponding decrease in the price of raw materials.\n\nIn addition to these longer-term trends, the price of raw materials and steel products can fluctuate significantly in a reasonably short period of time affecting the Group's short-term financial performance. In particular this relates to commodity products such as plate, hot rolled coil, cold rolled coil, and some metallic coated steel products.\n\n- d.  The Group is exposed to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.\n- The Group's financial prospects are sensitive to foreign exchange rate movements, in particular the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. A stronger Australian dollar relative to the US dollar has adverse effects on the Group. This is because in Australia, a strong Australian dollar makes imported steel products less expensive to Australian customers, potentially resulting in more imports of steel products and/or lower domestic prices. These effects are offset in part by a significant amount of raw material purchases being denominated in US dollars. In addition, BlueScope has significant earnings generated by its international businesses, in particular in the US, which must be translated into Australian dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n- e.  Competition from other materials and from other steel producers could significantly reduce prices and demand for the Group's products.\n- In many applications, steel competes with other materials such as aluminium, concrete, composites, plastic and wood. Improvements in the technology, production, pricing or acceptance of these competitive materials relative to steel could result in reduced volumes or margins.\n- BlueScope competes with local and international steel suppliers. Changes to trade measures (such as tariffs or local standards) anywhere in the world can have flow through impacts that could also negatively impact the Group.\n\nBlueScope monitors and responds to the above risks as required through business diversification, market and product development, cost control, operational restructuring and maintaining adequate liquidity.",

Reconciliation of Underlying Earnings to Reported Earnings\n\n## Table 12: Reconciliation of Underlying Earnings to Reported Earnings\n\nThe Company has provided an analysis of unusual items included in the reported IFRS financial information. These items have been considered in relation to their size and nature, and have been adjusted from the reported information to assist readers to better understand the financial performance of the underlying operating business. Throughout this report the Group has used the term 'reported' to reference IFRS financial information and 'underlying' to reference non-IFRS financial information. These adjustments are assessed on a consistent basis from period to period and include both favourable and unfavourable items. Non-IFRS financial information while not subject to audit or review has been extracted from the financial report which has been audited by BlueScope's external auditors. An explanation of each adjustment and reconciliation to the reported IFRS financial information is provided in the table below.\n\nTable 13: Segmental underlying EBIT adjustments\n\n|                                                        | EBITDA $M   | EBITDA $M   | EBIT $M   | EBIT $M   | NPAT $M   | NPAT $M   | EPS $  10   | EPS $  10   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                        | FY2022      | FY2021      | FY2022    | FY2021    | FY2022    | FY2021    | FY2022      | FY2021      |\n| Reported earnings                                      | 4,398.3     | 2,246.3     | 3,848.9   | 1,758.5   | 2,810.2   | 1,193.3   | 5.72        | 2.37        |\n| Underlying adjustments:                                |             |             |           |           |           |           |             |             |\n| Net (gains) / losses from businesses  discontinued  1  | (3.0)       | (9.6)       | (3.0)     | (9.6)     | (1.9)     | (9.0)     | (0.00)      | (0.02)      |\n| Asset impairments / (write-backs)  2                   | (37.3)      | -           | (37.3)    | -         | (11.5)    | -         | (0.02)      | -           |\n| Business development and acquisition  costs  3         | 24.4        | 7.9         | 24.4      | 7.9       | 19.0      | 4.2       | 0.04        | 0.01        |\n| Restructure and redundancy costs  4                    | -           | 6.2         | -         | 6.2       | -         | 4.3       | 0.00        | 0.01        |\n| Asset sales  5                                         | -           | (12.8)      | -         | (12.8)    | -         | (9.2)     | 0.00        | (0.02)      |\n| Pension fund adjustment  6                             | (40.6)      | (26.4)      | (40.6)    | (26.4)    | (30.0)    | (16.3)    | (0.06)      | (0.03)      |\n| Gain on lease termination  7                           | (5.1)       | -           | (5.1)     | -         | (3.2)     | -         | (0.01)      | -           |\n| Tax asset impairment / (write back)  8                 | -           | -           | -         | -         | (81.5)    | (10.6)    | (0.17)      | (0.02)      |\n| US Federal Tax payable on internal entity  transfer  9 | -           | -           | -         | -         | -         | 9.6       | -           | 0.02        |\n| Underlying Operational Earnings                        | 4,336.7     | 2,211.6     | 3,787.2   | 1,723.8   | 2,701.1   | 1,166.3   | 5.49        | 2.32        |\n\n| FY2022 underlying EBIT adjustments  $M             | North  Star   | ASP   | BP     | BCPNA   | NZPI   | Corp   | Discon  Ops   | Elims   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------------|---------|---------|\n| Net (gains) / losses from businesses  discontinued | -             | -     | -      | -       | -      | -      | (3.0)         | -       | (3.0)   |\n| Asset impairments                                  | -             | -     | (37.3) | -       | -      | -      | -             | -       | (37.3)  |\n| Business development and acquisition  costs        | 12.6          | -     | -      | 11.8    | -      | -      | -             | -       | 24.4    |\n| Pension fund adjustment                            | -             | -     | -      | (3.8)   | (36.8) | -      | -             | -       | (40.6)  |\n| Gain / (loss) on lease termination                 | -             | -     | -      | (5.1)   | -      | -      | -             | -       | (5.1)   |\n| Underlying Adjustments                             | 12.6          | -     | (37.3) | 2.9     | (36.8) | -      | (3.0)         | -       | (61.6)  |\n\n- 4 FY2021 reflects employee redundancy and restructuring costs at New Zealand & Pacific Islands ($4.6M pre-tax) and at Buildings North America ($1.6M pre-tax).\n- 5 FY2021 reflects a gain on land that was part of an 'asset swap' arrangement at New Zealand & Pacific Islands ($12.8M pre-tax).\n\n- 7 FY2022 reflects a gain received on termination of a building lease at Buildings and Coated Products North America ($5.1M pre-tax).\n- 8 FY2022 reflects the write-back of previously impaired deferred tax assets, including the full recognition of previously unbooked carried forward tax losses, in New Zealand ($81.5M).

        "page_content": "## Message from the Board\n\nBlueScope made strong strategic, operational and financial progress in FY2022, delivering a record full-year result of $3.79 billion underlying Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT), and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 41.6 per cent, both the highest in our 20 year listed history. Against a backdrop of economic volatility and operational challenges, the business portfolio has demonstrated its strength and resilience with this result, supported by strong demand and global steel prices.\n\nOperating cash flow, after capital expenditure including on the North Star expansion, was $1.71 billion 1 . From this, investments of $1 billion were made in the US acquiring the MetalX ferrous recycling business and the Coil Coatings business. During the year, we also delivered shareholder returns of nearly $1 billion and maintained a strong balance sheet - with $367 million net cash at 30 June 2022.\n\nFY2022 has been a year of major achievement and progress in the US, with the acquisition of new businesses and the expansion of the existing business. BlueScope's total investment in the US is now around $5 billion, with nearly 4,000 employees. The business network that we have assembled forms the exceptional backbone of our US value chain and is well positioned for future growth.\n\nDespite the economic volatility and operational challenges, that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented, BlueScope has performed strongly across a range of key areas in FY2022.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\n\nAfter listening to market feedback and as foreshadowed in the FY2021 Remuneration Report, the Board reviewed the performance measures and targets in the Short Term Incentive (STI) plan ahead of FY2022. To reflect the increasing importance of ESG as a measure of long-term sustainable success, the STI scorecard has been rebalanced. As a result, the weighting in the scorecard for safety and other ESG measures including climate change was increased, and safety measures aligned to the broader safety evolution program. Further detail on the FY2022 STI design is available in Section 5.2.\n\n## Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)\n\nIn FY2022, BlueScope employees completed over 243 teambased HSE risk control improvement projects. 1,372 leaders have now participated in the safety risk management program, with 112 of BlueScope's supply chain and industry partners also participating through the year. Accordingly, the component of the STI linked to leading safety indicators was achieved at slightly below the target level.\n\nAt 7.1, the lagging injury metric Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) remains slightly above the longterm range of 5-7, just missing the threshold required under the STI. However, the FY2022 injury profile continues to be lower severity injuries, and there were no fatalities during the year. The results represent encouraging progress on our lag indicators, especially given the challenging operating\n\nenvironment during the year, with sustained pandemic impacts, labour shortages, strong demand, execution of major projects, and the growth of our overall workforce. Accordingly, the Company missed the threshold and no STI was paid to the MD&CEO for this component. A 5 per cent reduction was also applied to the CFO whose STI maximum was reduced from 150 to 145 per cent of target, reflecting the forgone safety component.\n\n## Climate Action\n\nBlueScope continued to make progress in addressing climate change through the financial year 2 . Steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target with a 3.6 per cent reduction since FY2018. Midstream emissions intensity has decreased 3.7 per cent overall since FY2018, however increased in FY2022 on lower despatch volumes due to supply chain constraints and disruptions.\n\nWe are making progress on a range of projects to both optimise existing operating assets, as well as investigate and prepare for emerging and breakthrough technology.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nBlueScope continues to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. Female representation has continued to grow from 22 per cent in FY2021 to 24 per cent in FY2022, and the Board and Executive Leadership team have achieved 50 per cent and 40 per cent representation respectively. Recruitment and retention of women has been challenging due to low unemployment, high job vacancies (particularly in the US) and pandemic-related impacts across the BlueScope footprint. 'Beyond gender' strategies are emerging across the business, designed to suit local community needs - such as a focus on ethnicity in the US, resulting in ethnically diverse recruitment of 42 per cent for all new hires in FY2022.\n\n## Remuneration Framework Overview\n\nBlueScope's remuneration framework is designed to maintain a deliberate and continued focus on financial fundamentals, and provide more value to executives at less cost to shareholders. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 The quantum of Total Reward is set below the median of our market peers, with fixed pay at, or slightly above the median, and Short Term Incentive (STI) set lower than our peers.\n- \u00b7 The quantum of our Alignment Rights is set lower than market peers, reflecting our objective to perform above our peers return on invested capital through the cycle.\n- \u00b7 The framework drives alignment of executives with shareholders through equity ownership, both through the design of the Alignment Rights and minimum shareholding requirements which apply to the Executive Leadership Team.",

        "page_content": "Consideration has been given again this year to the continuing impact of COVID-19 and market uncertainty on remuneration programs. No significant changes have been required, as the mechanisms for ensuring alignment during times of volatility are already in place and working as intended.\n\n## FY2022 Performance and Reward Outcomes\n\nThe FY2022 remuneration outcomes reflect our strong business performance and are aligned to shareholder returns delivered during the year. The Board is satisfied that management has performed well, delivering strong financial outcomes. Significant progress has been made on the transformation and growth agenda, despite the economic and operational volatility experienced during the year. The Board is committed to ensuring that BlueScope's remuneration policies and practices reflect the Company's forward-looking strategy and Our Bond, and are consistent with the need to attract and retain the right global talent for the future.\n\n## Fixed Remuneration\n\nThe MD&CEO received a 5 per cent increase to his fixed remuneration in FY2022. This is the first increase provided to him since his appointment in January 2018. Certain Executive KMP also received a 5 per cent increase to their fixed pay in FY2022. Fixed pay increases were provided upon completion of a robust remuneration benchmarking exercise in the relevant local markets.\n\n## Short Term Incentives\n\nThe STI awarded to the MD&CEO was 82 per cent of maximum, and for other Executive KMP, awards ranged from 73 to 97 per cent of maximum. The STI scorecard is designed so that while each objective can be assessed between 0 and 200 per cent, the total scorecard is capped at 150 per cent of target (equal to 100 per cent of maximum). In FY2022, the MD&CEO and CFO's maximum opportunity was further reduced to 145 per cent of target (97 per cent of maximum) as a result of not meeting the TRIFR threshold. At the end of the year, the Board considered performance against each of the STI objectives, as well as the overall performance of BlueScope, the experience of shareholders and other employees, to ensure alignment. The Board is satisfied that the STI awards appropriately reflect individual, business and Group performance. More detail on the STI outcomes is available in Section 4.2.\n\nAcross the Company, over 60 per cent of our employees participate in business unit Profit Share Plans. Payouts under these plans in FY2022 also reflect our strong business performance and shareholder returns, and the exceptional efforts of employees in delivering in a challenging operational environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRebecca Dee-Bradbury\n\nChairman, Remuneration & Organisation Committee\n\n## Alignment Rights (Long Term Incentive)\n\nOver the three-year period to 30 June 2022, management delivered an average ROIC above the threshold hurdle, combined with careful debt management consistent with the objectives of our Financial Framework. As a result, both performance conditions of the FY2020 Alignment Rights have been met and awards will vest in full in September 2022.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nFollowing a market review of the Non-Executive Director fees, the Chairman and Directors' base fee was increased by 3 per cent, for the first time in several years.\n\nDue to the changing shape of the Board to reflect BlueScope's growth strategy and the increasing amount of travel, particularly to the US, an international travel allowance was introduced to ensure that Board members are remunerated adequately. This reflects the increased difficulty and risk in travel inherent in the post-COVID landscape.\n\nFurther, with the appointment of a new US-resident Director, the operation of the Non-Executive Director Minimum Shareholding Policy has been amended to recognise US tax requirements. Further detail on these changes is available in Section 6.\n\n## Changes in FY2023\n\nThe Board remains cognisant of the importance of ensuring market competitive fixed remuneration for executive KMP. We monitor and review remuneration annually, with regard to economic indicators, market movements and talent attraction and retention challenges. Generally, we have not passed on fixed pay increases to executive KMP each year, rather, these have been limited to individual market-based adjustments, or increases reflecting sustained high performance. However, the Board has decided to increase fixed remuneration by 3 per cent in FY2023 for the MD&CEO, recognising the significant inflationary pressures in our operating markets.\n\nWith the importance of the US in BlueScope's portfolio, there is an increasing requirement to attract and retain US-based executive talent. A detailed review of the equity-based component of US remuneration will be undertaken in FY2023. Any changes impacting KMP will be disclosed in the FY2023 Remuneration Report.\n\nWe trust that this Report clearly outlines the links between our strategy, performance, and executive remuneration alignment with shareholder interests. The Company is committed to a positive and transparent relationship with all its stakeholders, and we would like to thank you for your continued support at our Annual General Meeting in November.\n\nJohn Bevan Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

BlueScope's fixed remuneration is set at or slightly above the median of our market competitors  but is offset by lower variable reward - so total reward is lower than the market median for  comparable organisations. The lower total reward is balanced against increased certainty of  payment, while the significant weighting to equity encourages optimal management in favour of  shareholders through the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Section 3      |\n| 3.

The non-financial measures were carefully selected by the Board after considering  feedback received from investors and other stakeholders.

        "page_content": "- 4.  Are Alignment Rights' hurdles sufficiently challenging?\n\nOur Alignment Rights plan is designed to focus Executives on sustainable growth through the cycle, and reward them for generating shareholder returns. The hurdles are set at threshold level to reduce the impact of external cyclicality on reward outcomes. It is expected that the plan will vest regularly and in recognition of this increased certainty awards are lower in quantum relative to the market.\n\n- 5.  Why is there no linear vesting of Alignment Rights when hurdles are not met?\n\nThe Alignment Rights plan is designed to focus Executives on sustainable growth through the cycle. The hurdles are set at 'threshold' level and the quantum of award is set lower than market peers, meaning there is an increased likelihood of vesting, if the threshold measures are achieved over the cycle.\n\n- 6.  Why are the Alignment Rights' hurdles based on absolute measures, rather than relative performance against peers?\n\nUnlike traditional long-term incentives with linear vesting outcomes based on threshold to outperformance and a higher quantum of award, the BlueScope Alignment Rights plan drives consistent, sustainable performance, even during extremes in the cycle.\n\nThe Board conducts an annual review of the performance hurdles in the variable reward plans. The Board believes that ROIC and Net Debt Ratio remain the most suitable targets to measure BlueScope's long-term performance over the business cycle.\n\n- \u00b7 ROIC creates clear value for shareholders and is a highly relevant measure that reflects the capital-intensive nature of the industry and markets in which BlueScope operates, and incentivises Executives to be disciplined with invested capital, and\n- \u00b7 The Debt Leverage Ratio provides clear linkage with BlueScope's strategy to retain a strong balance sheet through the cycle and reflects the cyclical nature of the industry and markets in which BlueScope operates.\n\nThe Alignment Rights have a threshold ROIC hurdle of 10 per cent and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.3x averaged over the three-year performance period. Achieving the ROIC hurdle would achieve a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) over 3 years:\n\n- \u00b7 above median compared to major global steel companies, and\n- \u00b7 above 3 rd quartile compared to the ASX100.\n\nThis is shown in the table below, for data reported up to 6 July 2022.\n\nTable references minimum ROIC for each quartile. Simple average over periods. Quartiles allocated by number of companies.

How do reward  outcomes reflect  Company  performance?  BlueScope delivered:  \u00b7  Total shareholder return of (25) per cent in FY2022,  \u00b7  A record full-year result of $3.79 billion underlying EBIT and ROIC of 41.6 per cent, both the  highest in our 20 year listed history,   \u00b7  Operating cash flow for the year, after capital expenditure, was $1.71 billion 1 \u00b7  Significant progress on our HSE leadership agenda,  \u00b7  Significant climate action progress with the release of BlueScope's first Climate Action  Report, and  \u00b7  Solid performance over the last three years.  Accordingly, the Short Term Incentive award for the MD&CEO was 82 per cent of maximum, and  for other Executive KMP ranged from 73 to 97 per cent of maximum. The FY2020 Alignment  Rights will vest in full. The Board is satisfied that the reward outcomes appropriately reflect  individual, business and Group performance, and are aligned to the experience of shareholders  and other employees.   Section 4  10. How and why did the  Board apply  discretion in relation  to FY2022 reward  outcomes?  At the end of FY2022, the Board reviewed the full year outcome and determined that, while  BlueScope benefitted from the macro environment, management was able to operate at  maximum capacity while being challenged by COVID-19, supply chain logistics and significant  workforce growth, without major business disruption.   As the threshold level of safety performance (TRIFR) was not achieved, the Board reduced the  maximum STI that could be awarded to the MD&CEO and CFO to 145 per cent.   Section 4  11. Were there any fixed  pay increases for the  MD&CEO in  FY2022?  When the MD&CEO was appointed in 2018, his Total Remuneration was set significantly lower  than his predecessor, reflecting the new remuneration framework. Despite strong performance,  the MD&CEO has not received an increase since his appointment. As disclosed in the FY2021  Remuneration Report, there was an increase in his fixed pay by 5 per cent in FY2022, resulting  in Fixed Remuneration aligned to BlueScope's overall reward philosophy and target market  position.  12. Why has the Chief  Executive, Hot Rolled  Products, received a  much higher short- term incentive award  This role is critical to the delivery of North Star expansion, and therefore P Finan participates in a  Project Incentive plan in addition to the STI plan. The Project Incentive reflects both the criticality  of the project to BlueScope and remuneration practices in the competitive US market.

If an election is made to take the award partly or  wholly in share rights, the rights are granted at maximum opportunity, at the outset of the  performance period.  This allows Executives the opportunity to boost their shareholding in the Company, further  aligning their interests with those of shareholders. Further, granting the share rights at the outset  of the performance period provides additional leverage during the period, meaning that whilst the   | Section 5.2                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 14.

The current remuneration framework - at or slightly above  median market fixed pay and conservative variable reward - is outside of market  expectations in the US, both from a structural or pay mix perspective, but is also lower  in overall quantum.

        "page_content": "## Business Performance and Reward Outcomes\n\nThere is a strong link between executive remuneration outcomes and business performance. The Group has performed strongly against a wide range of business objectives in FY2022.\n\nBlueScope has delivered strong financial performance during the year, with a record full-year result of $3.79 billion underlying EBIT and ROIC of 41.6 per cent, both the highest in our 20 year listed history. Operating cash flow for the year, after capital expenditure, was $1.71 billion 1 .\n\nOver 243 team based HSE risk control improvement projects across all business units. Participation from leaders in the safety transformation program continued throughout FY2022 with 1,372 leaders, including the Board and ELT involved in expert led global HSE risk management workshops since the beginning of the program. This year, 112 supply chain and industry partners also participated. The program was recognised by our industry association, being awarded the winner of worldsteel's Safety and Health Excellence Recognition 2021 in Leadership and Culture.\n\nThe lagging injury metric TRIFR marginally exceeded the target range of 5-7. As a result, the threshold for safety under the STI was not achieved. Our injury profile continues to be lower severity injuries and there were no fatalities during the year, an encouraging result, given the challenging operating environment during the year with sustained pandemic impacts, labour shortages, strong demand, execution of major projects and the growth of our overall workforce.\n\nBlueScope continued to make progress in addressing climate change through the financial year 2 . Steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target with a 3.6 per cent reduction since FY2018. Midstream emissions intensity has decreased 3.7 per cent overall since FY2018, however increased in FY2022 on lower despatch volumes due to supply chain constraints and disruptions.\n\nUnderlying EBIT ROIC\n\n41.6%\n\n\uf0ec +16.8% on FY2021\n\n## Safety\n\n## Sustainability\n\n## Strategy Execution\n\nTRIFR (275 injuries)\n\n7.1\n\n1,372\n\nleaders involved in global management program\n\n100%\n\n243\n\nTeam-based risk control improvements completed\n\n- \uf0fc Attained World Steel Association 'Sustainability Champion' status\n- \uf0fc Port Kembla Steelworks awarded ResponsibleSteel\u2122 site certification\n- \uf0fc Achieved 1.9% reduction in steelmaking emissions intensity\n- \uf0fc 24% female workforce participation; beyond gender initiatives emerging\n- \uf0fc 308 sustainable supply chain assessments completed\n- \uf0fc North Star expansion substantially complete, in hot commissioning\n- \uf0fc Established BlueScope Recycling with MetalX ferrous acquisition\n- \uf0fc Established BlueScope Coated Products with Coil Coatings acquisition\n- \uf0fc Progressing Port Kembla reline feasibility assessment, incl technical and environmental upgrades\n\n## 4.1 Historical Company Performance and Reward Outcomes\n\nThe Company's incentive awards are designed to align Executive remuneration with business performance and weighted towards equity and shareholder outcomes. The table below summarises the Company's performance against a range of indicators for FY2022 and the previous four years, along with the MD&CEO's STI outcomes and Alignment Rights vesting since the introduction of the remuneration framework in FY2018.\n\nSTI outcomes for the MD&CEO have been aligned with BlueScope's performance against challenging targets set within the context of each year. The targets vary each year based on the prevailing market conditions. Alignment Rights have vested in each year since FY2020, aligning Executive reward with shareholder interests through equity ownership, and reflect sustainable multi-year performance even when taking into account the variability in market conditions between years.\n\nBoard and ELT participation risk management program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThree-year average ROIC 24.7% FY20, FY21, FY22",

The actual STI awarded can be adjusted where these expectations are deemed not to have been met. No such adjustments have been made for Executive KMP in FY2022. The Board also considers the application of discretion against predetermined principles that are outlined in Section 7.4. These include consideration of the shareholder experience, the broader employee experience and the impact of factors both within and outside of management's control. In FY2022, the Board applied their discretion to reduce the MD&CEO and CFO's maximum award to 145 per cent of target, to reflect below threshold performance on TRIFR.\n\nIn FY2022, management responded well to external conditions and demonstrated strong leadership to deliver significant value. Key achievements for the year were:\n\n- \u00b7 North Star delivering record underlying EBIT of $1.9 billion, driven by record steel pricing and spreads\n- \u00b7 ASP delivering record underlying EBIT of $1.3 billion, on record domestic volumes and robust prices\n- \u00b7 Construction of the 850,000 tonnes per annum expansion of North Star substantially completed; commencing ramp-up\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet maintained in solid position, having $367M net cash at 30 June 2022\n- \u00b7 Delivery of nearly $1 billion in shareholder returns, with $344 million in dividends and $638 million in on-market buy-backs 1\n- \u00b7 Significant steps taken in delivering BlueScope's US growth strategy with the acquisitions of the MetalX ferrous business and Coil Coatings business\n- \u00b7 Progressing Port Kembla reline feasibility assessment - including comprehensive technical and environmental upgrades\n- \u00b7 Driving growth and transformation, including continued rollout of digital program and progression of key projects.\n- \u00b7 Made significant progress on our HSE leadership agenda\n- \u00b7 Continued progress on climate - released our first Climate Action Report; delivering on medium-term targets; progressing a range of abatement projects and collaborations; actively evaluating NZ decarbonisation options.\n- \u00b7 Recognition of sustainability leadership\n- \u00b7 We have continued our efforts to reflect the communities in which we operate, with the total percentage of women in the BlueScope workforce reaching 24 per cent in FY2022. And moving beyond gender, strategies are emerging across the business, designed to suit local community needs.\n\nThe Board assessed the outcomes in light of business performance and strong outcomes delivered to shareholders and is satisfied that management has delivered outstanding value in FY2022.\n\nMore details on the MD&CEO's performance against the STI objectives is provided in the STI scorecard shown below, including a description of each performance measure and the MD&CEO's level of achievement, as determined by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Executive Remuneration Framework\n\nBlueScope's remuneration framework is guided by the principles outlined in Section 3. The principles extend to all elements of remuneration as described in detail below.\n\n## 5.1 Fixed Pay\n\nFixed pay recognises the market value of an individual's skills, experience, accountability and their expected sustained contribution in delivering the requirements of their role.  To attract and retain experienced and capable leaders, fixed pay at BlueScope needs to be competitive, and is set at slightly above the median of the peer group noted below. A separate peer group is used as an additional reference point for international Executive KMP.  Fixed pay includes base pay and superannuation or local retirement plans.\n\n## Remuneration peer group\n\nThe ROC has selected (and reviews annually) a peer group of companies for the purposes of benchmarking both fixed and variable remuneration. The peer group reflects the size and complexity of BlueScope with similarities on one or more of the following dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 operate in multiple geographies\n- \u00b7 have manufacturing or logistics operations in Australia\n- \u00b7 are involved in the building and construction industry\n- \u00b7 have similar number of employees\n- \u00b7 have similar revenue, or similar market capitalisation on the ASX.\n\nThe peer group is not solely based on market capitalisation, as the ROC believes that this would lead to unmanageable fluctuations in Executive remuneration, and could result in an inability to attract and retain the skills required to manage a business operating in the complex and volatile environment in which BlueScope operates globally.\n\nThe peer group for FY2022 is broadly consistent with last year and is listed below:\n\nAdbri Ltd\n\nBoral Ltd\n\nFletcher Building Ltd\n\nOrora Ltd\n\nAGL Energy Ltd\n\nBrambles Ltd\n\nIncitec Pivot Ltd\n\nQantas Airways Ltd\n\nALS\n\nCIMIC Group Ltd\n\nLend Lease Corp Ltd\n\nQube Holdings\n\nAmpol Ltd\n\nCSR Ltd\n\nOrica Ltd\n\nSouth32 Ltd\n\nAurizon Holdings Ltd\n\nDowner EDI Ltd\n\nOrigin Energy Ltd\n\nWorleyParsons Ltd\n\nIn addition to the peer group noted above, remuneration for Executive KMP is also benchmarked against local peers in international markets, where this is appropriate for the role and the incumbent. This ensures that BlueScope is able to attract and retain local talent in regions outside Australia, particularly where pay practices are quite different (e.g. in the US).\n\nWith the increasing importance of the US in BlueScope's portfolio, there is a greater requirement to attract and retain local US based talent. A peer group of steel and materials companies based in the US was selected to benchmark both fixed and variable remuneration.\n\nThe US peer group for FY2022 is listed below:\n\nAllegheny Technologies Corporation\n\nKaiser Aluminum Corporation\n\nSchnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.\n\nCarpenter Technology Corporation\n\nMaterion Corporation\n\nSteel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nCentury Aluminum Company\n\nNoranda Aluminum Holding Corporation\n\nSunCoke Energy, Inc.\n\nCleavlance-Cliffs Inc.\n\nNucor Corporation\n\nWorthington Industries, Inc.\n\nCompass Minerals International, Inc.\n\nOlympic Steel, Inc.\n\nContura Energy, Inc.\n\nRyerson Holding Corporation",

Each share right that vests entitles the holder to acquire one ordinary fully paid ordinary share in the Company.

Each participant is subject to an individual assessment of their conduct against Our Bond, which is undertaken by the  MD&CEO for the ELT (including KMP), and by the ROC in respect of the MD&CEO. Performance against the financial  measures includes verification of financial results by the Audit Committee. |\n| Exercise and  Expiry    | Vested Alignment Rights must be exercised during a trading window prior to the 31 December five years after the grant.  Exercise occurs automatically on vesting unless the participant elects not to exercise prior to the end of the performance  period.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Clawback                | In August 2019, the Board approved a clawback provision to apply to participants who were members of the ELT at the  time any relevant circumstance occurred for the FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019 awards. From the FY2020 award, the  clawback provision applies to all participants.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Clawback                | The clawback provision allows the Board to clawback Alignment Rights awards, any resulting shares from exercise of  the awards or the financial benefit of those resulting shares arising from the awards made to ELT members at the time  any of the following circumstances occurred:                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Clawback                | \u00b7  Breach of law or material breach of BlueScope policies or standards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Clawback                | \u00b7  Bringing BlueScope into disrepute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Clawback                | \u00b7  Material misstatement in financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Clawback                | \u00b7  Certain oversight or supervision failures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Clawback                | \u00b7  Any other act, error, omission or circumstance that would result in a participant obtaining an inappropriate benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Clawback                | The clawback applies for a period of three years after the vesting of any Alignment Rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Hedging                 | Executives are not permitted to hedge (such as 'cap and collar' arrangements) Alignment Rights awards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## 5.4 Changes in FY2023\n\nThe Board remains cognisant of the importance of ensuring market competitive fixed remuneration for executive KMP. Whilst historically we have not passed on fixed pay increases to executive KMP each year, we monitor and review remuneration annually with regard to increasing inflationary pressures and talent attraction and retention challenges. The Board has decided to increase fixed remuneration by 3 per cent for the MD&CEO in FY2023.\n\nWith the importance of the US in BlueScope's portfolio, there is an increasing requirement to attract and retain local US-based executive talent. A detailed review of the equity-based component of US remuneration will be undertaken in FY2023 and relevant outcomes will be disclosed in the FY2023 Remuneration Report.\n\n## 5.5 Executive Service Agreements\n\nThe following table outlines the summary terms of employment for the MD&CEO and other Executive KMP.\n\n| Role                | Term of agreement   | Notice period by  Executive   | Maximum notice  period by Company   | Termination benefits   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| MD&CEO              | Open                | 12 months                     | 12 months                           | 12 months fixed pay    |\n| Other Executive KMP | Open                | 6 months                      | 6 months                            | 12 months fixed pay    |\n\nAgreements are also in place for Executive KMP detailing the approach the Group will take with respect to termination payments and with respect to exercising its discretion on the vesting of Alignment Rights in the event of a 'Change of Control' of the organisation.\n\nExecutive KMP are also subject to restraints which will apply upon cessation of employment to protect the business interests of BlueScope. No separate amount is payable in relation to these restraints over and above the contractual entitlements outlined above.\n\nThe maximum payment on termination (including notice) is capped at 12 months fixed pay.",

        "page_content": "## 5.7 FY2022 Realised Pay\n\nThe following table outlines actual pay earned or realised by Executive KMP during FY2022. This is a voluntary disclosure and is provided as additional information to the statutory remuneration tables contained in Section 5.6. This table is different from the amounts shown in the statutory tables, as it excludes accruals and estimations and is therefore a closer measure of 'take home pay' earned by Executives in respect of the current year. Amounts are presented inclusive of any income tax that is payable.\n\nRealised pay includes the base salary, superannuation/retirement and other benefits paid or payable in relation to FY2022. It also includes the realised value of STI awards earned in relation to the FY2022 performance year (both cash and equity components), and the realised value of LTI awards with a performance period ending on 30 June 2022.\n\nThe realised value of equity awards is calculated as the difference between the allocation price, or price on grant, and the closing share price at the end of the performance period. This is different from the valuation of equity awards presented in the statutory tables which uses the accounting standard for expensing equity awards over time.\n\nOther benefits include the cost to the Company of Executive health checks and benefits and fringe benefits tax provided to international assignees. Tax equalisation payments, which include the difference between the amounts withheld by the Company and the actual tax paid on behalf of international assignees, are not included in the calculation of realised pay, however, are included in the statutory tables.\n\n| Name        |   Year | Fixed Remun- eration 1 $   | Other Benefits 2 $   | STI (Cash) 3 $   | STI (equity) 4 $   | LTI (value at grant) 5 $   | Total $   | Share price change (STI) 6 $   | Share price change (LTI) 6 $   | Total including share price change $   |\n|-------------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| M Vassella  |   2022 | 1,874,828                  | -

The Chairman, considering the greater time commitment required, receives a higher fee but does not receive any additional payment for service on Committees.\n\nFees are normally reviewed annually, and any adjustments are made effective in January. Following a review this year, the Board increased the Chairman and Director base fees in line with market movements. Effective 2 January 2022, the Chairman and Director base fees increased by 3 per cent, from $506,530 to $521,725 and $178,030 to $183,370 respectively. There was no increase to any Committee fees.\n\nWith the expansion in BlueScope's global operations, there is an increasing requirement for international travel being\n\n| Role                                      | Role                   | Base Fees  (incl super)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Chairman 1,2                              | Chairman 1,2           | $521,725                  |\n| Non-Executive Director                    | Non-Executive Director | $183,370                  |\n| Audit Committee                           | Chair                  | $41,000                   |\n|                                           | Member                 | $21,000                   |\n| Remuneration and Organisation  Committee  | Chair                  | $41,000                   |\n| Remuneration and Organisation  Committee  | Member                 | $21,000                   |\n| Health, Safety and Environment  Committee | Chair                  | $41,000                   |\n| Health, Safety and Environment  Committee | Member                 | $21,000                   |\n| Risk and Sustainability  Committee        | Chair                  | $41,000                   |\n|                                           | Member                 | $21,000                   |\n\n- 1 Additional fees are not payable to the Chairman for membership of Committees\n- 2 The Chairman base fee increased from $506,530 to $521,725, effective 2-Jan-22\n\nimposed on Board members along with added inconvenience and risk due to COVID-19. From 1 January 2022, a travel allowance of $5,000 per international trip was introduced, to compensate Board members undertaking scheduled international business travel.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fee Sacrifice Plan\n\nNon-Executive Directors can participate in a fee sacrifice plan, which enables them to build meaningful levels of equity over time. The plan provides an automated mechanism for participants to acquire shares, recognising that Non-Executive Directors may be limited in their ability to purchase shares because of Australian insider trading laws. From 1 July 2022 the plan has been extended to allow US resident Directors to participate and ensure it operates effectively in the US tax environment. Details of the plan are shown in the table below.\n\n| Feature               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eligibility           | Non-Executive Directors who are Australian or US residents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Year of grants        | The plan will operate from 1 July to 30 June.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Grant dates           | Rights are allocated in two tranches.

Such consultants report directly to the ROC. Potential conflicts of interest are considered in selecting remuneration consultants and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require independence from, BlueScope's management. Any advice from external consultants is used as a guide and is not a substitute for thorough consideration of all the issues by the ROC. The Chairman of the Board does not participate in any discussions relating to the determination of his own fees.\n\nDuring FY2022, the ROC employed the services of independent remuneration advisors to provide information and advice on remuneration strategy and structure including market practice which covers Executive KMP.  No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.\n\n## 7.4 Board discretion\n\nThe ROC and the Board consider it critical to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to ensure that remuneration outcomes for Executives appropriately reflect the performance of the Group and individuals and meet shareholders' expectations.

The Board is also able to  moderate variable reward outcomes in circumstances where the calculated result does not align with employee,  customer and shareholder experience.  In determining whether any discretion should be applied, the Board considers the extent to which reward outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                           | \u00b7  aligned with shareholder experience  \u00b7  aligned with the employee experience below ELT  \u00b7  a result of factors within management's influence  \u00b7  appropriately reflective of management's effort in both responding to, and capitalising on market conditions  throughout the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Malus / Forfeiture        | In the event of serious misconduct by management which undermines the Company's performance, financial  soundness and/or reputation, or inappropriate ethics and/or behaviour, the Board has absolute discretion to cancel  and withdraw any unvested STI or LTI awards that Executives elect to take in cash or equity.  Misconduct includes  misrepresentation or material misstatements due to errors, omissions or negligence.  In FY2022, the Board did not exercise their discretion on variable reward relating to misconduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Clawback                  | The Board has discretion in certain circumstances to clawback Alignment Rights awards, resulting shares or the  financial benefit of those shares. These circumstances include fraud or gross misconduct, breach of law, material  breach of policies or standards, bringing BlueScope into disrepute, material misstatement in financial statements,  certain oversight failures or any other circumstances where there would be an inappropriate benefit. The clawback  provisions apply to participants who were members of the ELT at the time any such circumstance occurred for the  FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019 awards for three years post vesting. From the FY2020 award onwards, the clawback  provision applies to all participants. |\n| Change of control         | The Board may permit Share Rights or Alignment Rights to vest if, at any time while there are Share Rights or  Alignment Rights which have not lapsed or vested, a takeover bid is made to acquire the whole of the issued  ordinary share capital of the Company or a transaction is announced by the Company which, if implemented, would  result in a person owning all of the issued shares in the Company. The Company must permit the Share Rights and  Alignment Rights to vest if a person acquires more than 50 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company  provided that the Board determines that the performance hurdles have been satisfied as assessed at that time  having regard to the shorter performance period.  |",

        "page_content": "## 7.5 Securities Trading Policy\n\nThe Company's Securities Trading Policy prohibits employees from dealing in the Company's securities while in possession of material non-public information relevant to the entity. It also prohibits entry into transactions in associated products that limit the economic risk of participating in unvested entitlements under equity-based remuneration schemes. In addition, nominated employees, including KMP, are prohibited from dealing in the Company's securities outside prescribed trading periods.\n\n## 7.6 Minimum shareholding requirements\n\nA key principle of the remuneration framework is to encourage Executives to behave like owners. The Board believes that the interests of all KMP should be closely aligned to those of shareholders through significant exposure to the Company's share price and dividends. Accordingly, the following minimum shareholding requirements are in place:\n\n|                                           | Minimum Shareholding  Requirement   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors                   | 100% of base fees                   |\n| MD&CEO                                    | 200% of fixed pay                   |\n| Executive Leadership Team (including KMP) | 100% of fixed pay                   |\n\nThe minimum shareholding requirement includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings and 50 per cent of vested, but unexercised share right awards for Executive KMP. For Australian Non-Executive Directors, it includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings. For US based Directors, the requirement includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings and unvested rights held under the Non-Executive Director fee sacrifice plan.\n\nThe ELT, including KMP, is expected to build their shareholding on a progressive basis over a reasonable period. The ROC regularly monitors the shareholding of the ELT, including Executive KMP. The Alignment Rights plan is an important mechanism to drive Executive share ownership through the regular vesting of rights on the achievement of the threshold performance hurdles. As at 30 June 2022, most executive KMP hold shares greater than their minimum shareholding requirement, and those who do not are new to the KMP role and are on track to achieving this requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is less than the Company's overall number of non-compliances reported last year, noting that the total number is at the lower end of the historical range and less than half the number recorded only a decade ago.\n\nThe NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) issued Australian Steel Products one advisory letter in relation to an incident at the Port Kembla Steelworks relating to a visible air emission that occurred through the standpipe cap water seal on oven 751 at Coke Plant 2 on 9 January 2022.\n\nAlso in relation to the Port Kembla Steelworks, Australian Steel Products received a formal warning from the EPA for a breach of the pH limit at the Ironmaking East Drain on 26 February 2022.\n\nFor the financial year to date no other penalty infringement notices or use of regulatory instruments have been reported across BlueScope's Australian operations.\n\nFurther environmental information will be provided in BlueScope's Sustainability Report due for release in September 2022.\n\n## Indemnification and Insurance of Officers\n\nThe Company has entered into directors' and officers' insurance policies and paid an insurance premium in respect of the insurance policies, to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001. The insurance policies cover former Directors of the Company along with the current Directors of the Company (listed on page 33). Executive officers and employees of the Company and its related bodies corporate are also covered.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 21 of its Constitution, the Company to the maximum extent permitted by law:\n\n- \u00b7 must indemnify any current or former Director or Secretary; and\n- \u00b7 may indemnify current or former executive officers,\n\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries, against all liabilities (and certain legal costs) incurred in those capacities to a person, including a liability incurred as a result of appointment or nomination by the Company or its subsidiaries as a trustee or as a Director, officer or employee of another corporation.\n\nCurrent and previous Directors of the Company and the previous Chief Financial Officer and previous Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary have entered into an Access, Insurance and Indemnity Deed (Deed) with the Company. The Deed addresses some or all of the matters set out in Rule 21 of the Constitution and includes, among other things, provisions requiring the Company to indemnify an officer to the extent to which they are not already indemnified as permitted under law, and to use its best endeavours to maintain an insurance policy covering the period while they are in office and seven years after ceasing to hold office. It is the Company's practice that its employees should be protected from any liability they incur as a result of acting in the course of their employment, while acting in good faith.\n\nThe Directors have not included details of the nature of the liabilities covered or the amount of the premium paid in respect of the directors' and officers' liability insurance contract, as (in accordance with normal commercial practice) such disclosure is prohibited under the terms of the contract.\n\n## Indemnification of Auditors\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms of its audit engagement agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit. No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the financial year.",

In addition to delivering goods, the Group also provides design, construction or installation services in our Buildings and Building Product businesses in accordance with the contract. Other than for the provision of service warranties, the Group's performance obligations primarily have an original expected duration of one year or less.",

        "page_content": "## 2  Revenue (continued)\n\nRevenue is recognised at a point in time for goods being upon delivery to the customer or over the ship's rail. Revenue is recognised over time for bundled goods and services such as design, construction or installation services. The Group has determined that the output method is the best method in measuring bundled goods and the input method for measuring services as there is a direct relationship between the Group's effort and the transfer of goods and services to the customer. The Group recognises revenue on the basis of the total goods delivered and costs expected relative to the total expected goods to be delivered and total expected costs.\n\nThe contract transaction price can vary due to volume and steel pricing rebates, early payment discounts and for short tail claims for product shipped and billed to the customer that did not meet previously agreed specifications. Variable consideration is estimated using the 'most likely amount method' for contracts with a single volume threshold and the 'expected value method' for contracts with more than one volume threshold.\n\nThe majority of the Group's product warranties are assurance type warranties. However, the North American Buildings and Building Product businesses offer service warranties to customers, ranging from 5 to 30 years. Service warranty premium is treated as a separate performance obligation with revenue recognised over the warranty period.\n\n## 3  Other income\n\n|                                                    |             | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                    | Notes       | 2022 $M        | 2021 $M        |\n| Carbon permit income                               | 3(a)        | 109.4          | 62.2           |\n| Government grants                                  |             | 1.2            | 1.8            |\n| Insurance recoveries                               |             | 0.1            | 0.1            |\n| Net gain on sale of PP&E and ROU lease termination | 12(a),17(d) | 4.2            | 10.0           |\n| Net foreign exchange gains                         |             | 1.5            | -              |\n|                                                    |             | 116.4          | 74.1           |\n\n## (a)  Carbon permit income\n\nCarbon permit income arises from New Zealand Government's Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS).

        "page_content": "## 4  Income tax (continued)\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than from a business combination or the adoption of a new accounting standard, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\n## Offsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## (h)  Key judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made.\n\nIn addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future forecast taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.\n\nNew Zealand Steel has recognised a $79.6M deferred tax asset at 30 June 2022 (2021: $61.9M). The utilisation of the deferred tax asset amount depends upon future taxable amounts in excess of profits arising from the reversal of temporary differences. The Group believes these amounts to be recoverable based on taxable income projections.\n\n## 5  Earnings per share\n\n|                         | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                         | Basic          | Basic          | Diluted        | Diluted        |\n|                         | 2022           | 2021           | 2022           | 2021           |\n|                         | Cents          | Cents          | Cents          | Cents          |\n| Continuing operations   | 570.9          | 234.9          | 566.5          | 232.8          |\n| Discontinued operations | 0.6            | 2.1            | 0.6            | 2.1            |\n| Earnings per share      | 571.5          | 237.0          | 567.1          | 234.9          |\n\n## (a)  Earnings used in calculating earnings per share\n\n|                                                      | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                      | 2022 $M        | 2021 $M        |\n| Profit used in calculating basic earnings per share: |                |                |\n| Continuing operations                                | 2,807.0        | 1,183.1        |\n| Discontinued operations                              | 3.1            | 10.2           |\n|                                                      | 2,810.1        | 1,193.3        |",

The facilities mature in September 2022 ($43.6M) and December 2023 ($350.0M). These programs involve the sale of relevant trade receivables across Australian Steel Products, New Zealand Steel and North Star BlueScope Steel. The business acts as a servicer under the programs and continues to collect cash from its customers for which a fee is received.\n\nThe receivables securitisation programs qualify for derecognition of trade receivables in their entirety, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the trade receivables have expired or are transferred. The Group maintains a continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets by virtue of reserving requirements under the programs. The maximum exposure to loss for the Group from its continuing involvement is $65.8M which is determined by the amount of reserves funded by BlueScope, less customer collections during the month. Interest income and service fee earned on this financial asset was $8.8M (2021: $5.0M). Total costs from selling the receivables and running the programs were $24.0M (2021: $15.9M), recorded within other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIn the event bad or doubtful debts exceed a specified limit, the Group will have to recognise the trade receivables on the balance sheet. Under these securitisation programs, the program provider is exposed to the first loss and to qualify for derecognition bad or doubtful debts must not exceed the first loss limit. Current experience and bad debt history is below this level. In the event this limit is exceeded, the Group would have to recognise the trade receivable on the balance sheet with the program recorded as borrowings. The carrying amount of trade receivables de-recognised as at 30 June 2022 is $397.1M (2021: $393.7M) which is reflected by a decrease in trade receivables of $189.5M (2021: $148.9M), an increase in sundry payables of $273.4M (2021: $296.3M) offset by a $65.8M (2021: $51.5M) increase in sundry receivables which approximates fair value.\n\n## (d)  Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade receivables are held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows representing 'solely payment of principal and interest' on the principal amount outstanding. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 to 90 days.\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nDebts which are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified. A provision for impairment is recognised when there is objective evidence that amounts due may not be received. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to current receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.",

        "page_content": "## 6  Trade and other receivables (continued)\n\nIn addition, a provision for impairment is recognised using a forward looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach.\n\nECL's are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. For contract assets and trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard's simplified approach and has calculated the ECL's based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for any forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\n## 7  Inventories\n\n|                                            | Consolidated   | Consolidated    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                            | 2022           | 2022            | 2021           | 2021           |\n|                                            | Current $M     | Non- current $M | Current $M     | Non- current   |\n|                                            |                |                 |                | $M             |\n| At lower of cost and net realisable value: |                |                 |                |                |\n| Raw materials and stores                   | 1,299.9        | -               | 818.0          | -              |\n| Work in progress                           | 947.8          | -               | 624.2          | -              |\n| Finished goods                             | 1,244.3        | -               | 756.9          | -              |\n| Spares and other                           | 207.0          | 68.7            | 119.1          | 61.6           |\n|                                            | 3,699.0        | 68.7            | 2,318.2        | 61.6           |\n\n## (a)  Inventory expense / write-back\n\nDuring the year, $30.7M (2021: $27.9M write-back) was recognised as an expense for inventories carried at net realisable value. The expense has been included in 'raw materials and consumables used' in the profit and loss.\n\n## (b)  Recognition and measurement\n\nRaw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Cost includes the transfer from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases of raw materials. Costs are assigned to inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to sell.\n\n## 8  Operating intangible assets\n\n|                                                       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                       | 2022           | 2022           | 2021           | 2021           |\n|                                                       |                | Non-           |                | Non-           |\n|                                                       | Current $M     | current $M     | Current $M     | current $M     |\n| Emission unit (EU) permits - not held for trading (i) | 79.5           | 172.9          | 41.0           | 106.2          |\n| Energy certificates - not held for trading (ii)       | 3.2            | -              | 4.6            | -              |\n|                                                       | 82.7           | 172.9          | 45.6           | 106.2          |\n\n## (a)  Recognition and measurement\n\n(i) Emission unit (EU) permits which are not held for trading are classified as intangible assets and are carried at cost.

Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.",

        "page_content": "## 10  Provisions (continued)\n\n## (c)  Key judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\n\n## (d)  Employee benefits\n\n## (i)   Annual leave and long service leave\n\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled after 12 months is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds other than New Zealand where Government bonds are used, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nEmployee benefit on-costs are recognised and included in employee benefit liabilities and costs when the employee benefits to which they relate are recognised as liabilities.\n\n## Amounts not expected to be settled within 12 months for current leave provisions\n\nThe current provision for long service leave includes all unconditional entitlements where employees have completed the required period of service. The entire annual leave amount and vested portion of long service leave are presented as current. Since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued annual leave and long service leave or require payment within the next 12 months. Current annual leave and long service leave obligation expected to be settled after 12 months is $150.8M (2021: $152.7M).\n\n## (ii)  Termination benefits\n\nLiabilities for termination benefits, not in connection with a business combination or the closure of an operation, are recognised when the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.\n\nThe employee redundancy provision balance reflects a range of internal reorganisations. All redundancies are expected to take effect within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\n## (iii) Short Term Incentive plans (STI)\n\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for STI plan payments made to employees. The Group recognises a provision where past practice and current performance indicates that a probable constructive obligation exists.\n\n## (e)  Restructuring costs\n\nLiabilities arising directly from undertaking a restructuring program, defined as the closure of an operating site, are recognised when a detailed plan of the restructuring activity has been developed and implementation of the restructuring program as planned has commenced, by either entering into contracts to undertake the restructuring activities or making a detailed announcement such that affected parties are in no doubt the restructuring program will proceed.\n\nThe provision primarily relates to Australian Steel Products segment to cover estimated future costs of site closures which are to be utilised over various terms up to a maximum period of 11 years.\n\n## (f)  Product claims\n\nProvision for claims is based on modelled data combining sales volumes with past experiences of repair and replacement levels in conjunction with any specifically identified product faults.\n\n## (g)  Workers compensation\n\nIn Australia and North America, the Company is a registered self-insurer for workers compensation. Provisions are recognised based on calculations performed by an external actuary in relation to the expectation of future events. A contingent liability exists in relation to guarantees given to various state workers compensation authorities, due to self-insurance prerequisites (refer to note 26(a)).",

        "page_content": "## 10  Provisions (continued)\n\nFor the Group, an actuarially determined asset of $28.9M (2021: $32.7M) has been recognised for expected future reimbursements associated with workers compensation recoveries from third parties. This amount is included in non-current other receivables (refer to note 6) as there is no legal right offset against the workers compensation provision.\n\n## (h)  Restoration and rehabilitation\n\nRestoration and rehabilitation provisions includes $5.1M (2021: $5.5M) for New Zealand Steel in relation to its operation of its iron sands mine in Waikato North Head. The provision has been classified as non-current as the timing of payments to remedy the site will not be made until cessation of operation which is not expected for many years.\n\nThe balance of the provision relates to leased sites that require rectification and restoration work at the end of their respective lease periods, primarily within the Australian Steel Products Segment for $28.1M (2021: $29.7M).\n\nRecognising restoration, remediation and rehabilitation provisions requires assumptions to be made as to the application of environmental legislation, site closure dates, available technologies and engineering cost estimates. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.\n\n## (i)  Carbon emissions\n\nThe Group is a participant in the New Zealand Government's uncapped Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).\n\nThe emissions liability is recognised as a provision for carbon and is measured at the carrying amount of Emission Units (EUs) held with excess units, if any, held for trading measured at the current market value of EUs. ETS costs passed through from suppliers are included as part of the underlying cost of the good or service rendered. The liability is either included within trade creditors or recorded as an emissions liability within the carbon provision account when an agreement has been reached with the supplier to settle the ETS cost by transferring EUs.\n\nWhen EUs are delivered to the government or a third party, the EU asset along with the corresponding carbon provision is derecognised from the statement of financial position.\n\n## 11  Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## (a)  Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Group makes superannuation contributions to defined contribution funds in respect of the entity's employees located in Australia and other countries. As at 30 June 2022, the defined contribution expense recognised in the profit and loss amounted to $106.8M (2021: $101.6M).\n\nThe defined contribution plans receive fixed contributions from Group companies with the Group's legal obligation limited to these contributions. Contributions to defined contribution funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.\n\n## (b)  Defined benefit plans\n\n| Country            | Fund type                                                              | Description                                                               |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| New Zealand        | Pension Fund and Retirement Savings Plan  (closed to new participants) | New Zealand employees are members of the  New Zealand Steel Pension Fund. |\n| North America  (1) | Pension Plan (closed to new participants)                              | US Coil Coaters employees are members of the  Cambridge Pension Pan.      |\n\nDefined benefit funds provide defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final or average salary. Actuarial assessments of the defined benefit funds are made at no more than three-yearly intervals, with summary assessments performed annually. The last formal actuarial assessments was made of the New Zealand Steel Pension Fund as at 30 June 2021.\n\n(1) A $6.7M North America Retirement benefit asset was acquired as part of the Coil Coatings business acquisition on 28 June 2022 (refer to Note 21(a)(ii)).",

Any plan surplus will be realised through reduced future Group contributions.\n\nThe settlements resulted in a net NZ$38.0M gain, with a NZ$53.8M gain on the pensioner settlement and a NZ$15.8M loss on the employee settlement, inclusive of 33% fund contributions tax. The pensioner settlement did not result in a settlement gain in the fund itself, as the benefit payments made were equal to the pensioners entitlements. This accounting gain arises because the AASB 119 Employee Benefits accounting liability is higher than the benefit payments made as the accounting liability is required to be discounted at the New Zealand Government bond rate which is lower than the expected return on the fund's assets. The employee settlement resulted in a loss in the fund, which needed to be made good through additional company contributions, as the payment was required to be based on the higher vested benefit while the funding position is based on accrued benefits.\n\nAn additional NZ$60.0M cash contribution has been paid by the company to the fund during the period with another NZ$24.7M contribution, accrued at 30 June 2022, paid in July and August 2022. These contributions were necessary in order to execute the lump-sum payments.\n\n## (e)  Categories of plan assets\n\n|                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                    | 2022 $M        | 2021 $M        |\n| Cash               | 15.4           | 4.9            |\n| Equity instruments | 105.4          | 245.1          |\n| Debt instruments   | 86.1           | 174.1          |\n| Property           | 27.7           | 47.0           |\n|                    | 234.6          | 471.1          |",

The objective of funding is to ensure that the benefit entitlements of members and other beneficiaries are fully funded by the time they become payable.\n\nTotal employer contributions expected to be paid for the year ending 30 June 2023 are $6.8M.\n\n## (k)  Recognition and measurement\n\nA liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the superannuation fund's assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the end of the reporting period, calculated half yearly by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on government or corporate bonds where a deep market exists, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in other comprehensive income.\n\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Upon settlement the net defined benefit liability is remeasured using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions, including current market yields. A gain or loss on settlement, being the difference between the benefits of the plan prior to the settlement and the benefits of the plan post settlement, is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nFuture taxes that are funded by the entity and are part of the provision of the existing benefit obligation (e.g. taxes on investment income and employer contributions) are taken into account in measuring the net liability or asset.",

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of a replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter lease term, unless there is reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.\n\nThe useful lives of major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Category                                  | Useful Life     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Land                                      | Not depreciated |\n| Buildings                                 | 30-40 years     |\n| Iron and steel making plant and machinery | 20-40 years     |\n| Coating lines                             | 20-30 years     |\n| Building components plant and equipment   | 12-18 years     |\n| Other plant and equipment                 | 5-15 years      |\n\n## Derecognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is sold or otherwise disposed of, or when its use is expected to bring no future economic benefits.\n\n## (d)  Key estimates\n\nThe estimation of the useful lives of plant and machinery has been based on historical experience and judgement with respect to technical obsolescence, physical deterioration and usage capacity of the asset in addition to any legal restrictions on usage. The condition of the asset is assessed at least once a year and considered against the remaining useful life.",

Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## (ii)  Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair market value at the date of acquisition. Customisation and configuration costs for cloud computing arrangements (SaaS) are capitalised when the company has control of a separate identifiable asset. All software data migration and training costs are expensed.\n\nFollowing initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at each financial year end.\n\nA summary of the useful lives of intangible assets is as follows:\n\n| Category                             | Useful Life                        |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Patents, trademarks and other rights | Indefinite and finite (7-15 years) |\n| Computer software                    | Finite (3-10 years)                |\n| Customer relationships               | Finite (10-20 years)               |",

        "page_content": "## 13  Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## (iii) Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. For the year ended 30 June 2022, $26.6M (2021: $24.6M) was recognised for research and development expenditure within other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and its costs can be measured reliably.\n\n## 14  Carrying value of non-financial assets\n\n## (a)  Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group tests property, plant and equipment (note 12), right-of-use assets (note 17) and intangible assets with definite useful lives (note 13) when there is an indicator of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for any impairment.\n\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting period to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (b)  Allocation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to cash generating units\n\nGoodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing purposes as follows:\n\n| Cash generating units           | Reportable segments                         | 2022 $M   | 2021 $M   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Building Products North America | Building Products Asia and North America    | 4.0       | 3.7       |\n| Buildings North America         | Buildings and Coated Products North America | 318.3     | 291.3     |\n| Coil Coaters North America  (1) | Buildings and Coated Products North America | 557.9     | -         |\n| North Star BlueScope Steel      | North Star BlueScope Steel                  | 1,130.2   | 885.1     |\n| Buildings China                 | Building Products Asia and North America    | 3.3       | 3.3       |\n| Total goodwill                  | Total goodwill                              | 2,013.7   | 1,183.4   |\n\nThe allocation is made to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. In addition to goodwill, the Group has other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of $4.2M (2021: $3.9M) allocated to the Buildings North America CGU which primarily relates to the Varco Pruden trade names acquired in February 2008. All of the above CGUs were tested for impairment at the reporting date.\n\n## (c)  Key assumptions and estimates\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU is determined on the basis of value-in-use (VIU), unless there is evidence to support a higher fair value less cost to sell. BlueScope operates in markets which are impacted by economic cycles and short-term volatility.\n\nThe global economy, and in particular North America, Australia and New Zealand, recovered faster and stronger than anticipated from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with favourable macroeconomic conditions and demand for steel products in FY2022. However, challenges arising from the pandemic have persisted and are expected to continue for some time, including operational continuity risks associated with maintaining pandemic safe work practices and disruptions to logistics and our supply chains.\n\nThe price, cost and demand for BlueScope's products are uncertain and the Company considers a range of recognised external forecasters when assessing possible future market conditions. These external forecasters expect commodity steel prices to have peaked in FY2022 and are forecasting them to decline to levels broadly in line with historical long-term average by FY2026. In addition, demand for BlueScope's products is expected to moderate but remain relatively strong in Australia and New Zealand, continue to support full utilisation of pre-existing steelmaking capacity in North America (together with a ramp-up in capacity from the North Star expansion project over the next two years) and continue to grow from the FY2022 levels in Asia over the next three years.",

Post-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising post-tax discount rate of 9.5% (2021: 9.4%).\n\nAt 30 June 2022 the recoverable amount of the CGU is 2.3 times (2021: 4.0 times) the carrying amount of $3,319.5M (2021: $2,374.3M), including non-current assets and net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to the spread between North American hot rolled coil and purchased scrap prices. Recognised external forecasters expect the spread to peak in FY2022 and are forecasting a return to be broadly in line with historical long-term average levels by FY2026. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ, such that the expected cash flow forecasts for North Star BlueScope Steel were to decrease by approximately 56% (2021: 76%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## (e)  Sensitivity of carrying amounts\n\nIn addition to the GCU's with significant goodwill, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment of the Group is most sensitive to cash forecasts for Australian Steel Products (ASP) and New Zealand and Pacific Islands (NZPI), as they are exposed to global steel macroeconomic factors. The carrying amount of these CGUs are determined taking into account the key assumptions set out above.\n\nFor ASP, recognised external forecasters estimate the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar to strengthen in the long term relative to the year ended 30 June 2022 and estimate Asian commodity steel prices to decrease partly offset by lower iron ore and coking coal average costs relative to the year ended 30 June 2022. The Group believes that the long-term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nASP is exposed to variable macroeconomic factors and domestic demand, and to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ such that the expected cash flow forecasts were to decrease by approximately 34% (2021: 57%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\nFor NZPI, recognised external forecasters estimate the New Zealand dollar relative to the US dollar to strengthen in the long term relative to the year ended 30 June 2022 and estimate global commodity steel prices to decrease relative to the year ended 30 June 2022 in the longer term. The Group believes that the long term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nNZPI recognised partial impairment of its non-financial assets in FY2016 and FY2020 and as at 30 June 2022 has approximately $180M available to be reversed. NZPI is exposed to variable global macroeconomic factors such as commodity steel prices and exchange rates, together with regional New Zealand factors such as domestic demand and energy costs, which impact its cash flows. While the CGU has delivered cash flows over the last two years which, if such cash flows were to continue, could support a reversal, after taking into account the variable historical earnings performance of the CGU through the economic cycle and the range of possible long-term forecast scenarios, the Company has determined that the recoverable value is consistent with the current carrying value.\n\n## (f)  Recognised net impairment (write-back)\n\n| Cash generating units                                    | 2022   | 2021   | Discount rates   | Discount rates   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| Building Products Thailand net impairment write-back (i) | $M     | $M     | 2022 (%)         | 2021 (%)         |\n|                                                          | (38.6) | -      | 10.1             | -                |\n\n(i) As at 30 June 2022, Building Products Thailand (a CGU within Building Products Asia and North America) recognised $46.0M of impairment write-back against property, plant and equipment offset by $7.4M of impairment charge recognised in Lysaght Myanmar upon management's decision to close the business. The write-back reflects a full reversal of impairment charges available to be written-back from a 30 June 2019 impairment of this CGU and reflects stronger than expected growth in sales volumes, mainly in the retail and manufacturing sectors, and stronger margins in the last two years which are expected to be sustained. The recoverable amount of this CGU, using the value-in-use method and a post-tax discount rate of 10.1%, is $748M (2021: $605M, 10.2%).",

Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are consequently recognised in profit or loss over the term.\n\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\n## 17  Leases\n\n## (a) Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, is required to recognise right-of-use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments.\n\n## (b) Right-of-use assets\n\n|                                         | Notes   | Land and  Buildings $M   | Plant,  machinery & equipment $M   | Total $M   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Year ended 30 June 2022                 |         |                          |                                    |            |\n| Opening net book amount                 |         | 230.3                    | 127.6                              | 357.9      |\n| Additions                               |         | 56.1                     | 55.1                               | 111.2      |\n| Business acquisitions                   | 21(a)   | 1.6                      | 1.7                                | 3.3        |\n| Depreciation charge                     |         | (54.7)                   | (39.6)                             | (94.3)     |\n| Lease terminations                      | 17(d)   | (16.2)                   | (0.1)                              | (16.3)     |\n| Impairment charge                       | 14(f)   | (1.2)                    | -                                  | (1.2)      |\n| Asset reclassifications from PP&E       |         | 5.2                      | -                                  | 5.2        |\n| Asset reclassifications                 |         | 0.6                      | (0.6)                              | -          |\n| Exchange fluctuations                   |         | 4.8                      | 3.8                                | 8.6        |\n| Closing net book amount                 |         | 226.5                    | 147.9                              | 374.4      |\n| At 30 June 2022                         |         |                          |                                    |            |\n| Cost                                    |         | 571.7                    | 462.3                              | 1,034.0    |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment |         | (345.2)                  | (314.4)                            | (659.6)    |\n| Net book amount                         |         | 226.5                    | 147.9                              | 374.4      |",

Service contracts may be, in substance, wholly or partly leases.\n\nIn determining whether all or part of a contract should be recognised as a lease it may be necessary to identify the components of the contract. The component of the contract that represents service costs are not included as part of the lease rentals.\n\n## (ii)   Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\n## Cost comprises of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 Any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 Restoration costs.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the lease or over the life of the asset if ownership of the underlying asset is to be transferred at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and are assessed at either individual asset level, if it generates cash flows which are largely independent from other assets, or at a cash generating unit level.",

        "page_content": "## 17  Leases (continued)\n\n## (iii)  Lease liabilities\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nVariable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time (e.g. rentals based on usage) are excluded from lease payments recognised on balance sheet and are recognised in the profit and loss as incurred. Variable leases for the Group primarily relate to leases embedded within service agreements relating to transport and steel mill services.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by interest on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase option, extension option or lease termination is reasonably certain to be exercised or when there is a lease modification.\n\n## (iv)   Short-term and leases of low value assets\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, being a period of 12 months or less from the commencement date, and one which does not contain a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption, being a distinct asset worth less than $10,000 when brand new. This would typically include laptop computers and office equipment. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.\n\n## (f) Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group has applied judgement when determining the relative standalone prices of the lease and non-lease components contained within service agreements.The lease asset rentals have been determined using estimated asset depreciation charges uplifted for specific contract margins.\n\nJudgement has also been applied when determining the lease terms for lease contracts containing extension options. Lease terms have been assessed based on whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options. This assessment impacts the value of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised. Lease extension options are at the Group's discretion of being exercised and are primarily associated with property leases within the ASP building product businesses. The use of extension options provides the Group flexibility when determining the future use of leasehold properties that meets ever changing business requirements. Gross lease extension options, for which the Group is not reasonably certain of exercise and has been excluded from the lease liability, total $515.4M. Of this amount, $320.5M relates primarily to property lease extension options beyond 2030.\n\n## 18  Contributed equity\n\n## (a)  Share capital & Treasury shares\n\n|                                   | Parent Entity   | Parent Entity   | Parent Entity   | Parent Entity   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   | 2022 Shares     | 2021 Shares     | 2022 $M         | 2021 $M         |\n| Issued fully paid ordinary shares | 470,602,388     | 503,806,240     | 2,987.7         | 3,650.8         |\n| Treasury shares                   | (1,517,531)     | (50,154)        | (29.7)          | (0.9)           |\n| Total contributed equity          | 469,084,857     | 503,756,086     | 2,958.0         | 3,649.9         |",

In August 2021, 1,600,000 shares were purchased on market at an average cost of $24.63 of which 1,532,623 were utilised for settlement of equity share award schemes. An additional 1,400,000 shares were purchased on market at an average cost of $19.38 in March 2022 and are available to be utilised for future settlement of equity share award schemes.\n\n## (c)  Capital risk management\n\nManagement monitors its capital structure through various key financial metrics with an emphasis on net debt. The Group's net debt is managed through the economic price cycle to ensure access to finance at reasonable cost regardless of the point in the cycle. On occasions, the Group will take advantage of certain investment opportunities where an increased level of net debt will be tolerated, provided there is sufficient future cash flow strength and flexibility to be confident of credit strengthening rather than uncertainty and risk of credit weakening.\n\nIn managing equity, all methods of returning funds to shareholders outside of dividend payments or raising funds are considered within the context of its balance sheet objectives. In managing debt, the Group seeks a diversified range of funding sources and maturity profiles. Sufficient flexibility is maintained within committed facilities in order to provide the business with the desired liquidity support for operations and to pursue its strategic objectives.\n\n|                                 |       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|---------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                 | Notes | 2022 $M        | 2021 $M        |\n| Total borrowings                | 16    | 777.2          | 622.5          |\n| Lease liabilities               | 17(c) | 538.4          | 541.3          |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents | 15    | (1,682.7)      | (1,961.9)      |\n| Net (cash) debt                 |       | (367.1)        | (798.1)        |\n| Total equity                    |       | 10,448.1       | 8,160.4        |\n| Total capital                   |       | 10,081.0       | 7,362.3        |\n| Gearing ratio                   |       | 0.0%           | 0.0%           |",

It is also used to record the effect of the translation of the net investments in foreign operations. The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit and loss when the foreign subsidiary is disposed of.\n\n## (iv) Non-distributable profit reserve\n\nIn certain overseas operations local regulations require a set amount of retained profit to be set aside and not be distributed as a dividend.\n\n## (v)  Asset realisation reserve\n\nArises from the disposal of 50% interest in BlueScope's ASEAN and west coast North American building product businesses to Nippon Steel Corporation in March 2013. Prior year asset realisation reserve movement included $8.4M for withholding tax paid for the establishment of the BlueScope and Nippon Steel joint venture that was accounted for as a receivable but no longer expected to be refunded.\n\n## (vi)  Asset revaluation reserve\n\nArises from the investment held by New Zealand Steel Ltd in Steel & Tube Holdings Ltd. Designated changes in fair value are recognised in the asset revaluation reserve (refer to note 22).\n\n## (vii) Controlled entity acquisition reserve\n\nArises from the Group's acquisition of the remaining 40% non-controlling interest in BlueScope Steel (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and 5% of Lysaght Thailand Ltd and BlueScope Steel Thailand Ltd, adjusted for the subsequent 50% disposal of their additional interests into BlueScope and Nippon Steel Corporation joint venture established in March 2013.

MetalX is the largest of North Star's diverse scrap steel suppliers, currently supplying around 20% of the scrap used. The acquisition increases scrap self-sufficiency through low capital capacity additions and process improvements in both prime and obsolete scrap processing.\n\nFrom the date of acquisition, the scrap recycling business has contributed revenues of $302.5M and earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $12.6M to the Group, which includes $2.2M of integration costs.\n\n(ii) On 28 June 2022, the Group acquired Coil Coatings business from Cornerstone Buildings Brands, Inc for US$500M, subject to working capital adjustments. Coil Coatings is the second largest metal painter in the US, with a total capacity of around 900,000 tonnes per annum across seven facilities, predominantly serving commerical and industrial construction applications. The acquisition provides immediate access to the large and growing Eastern US region in addition to near-term synergies and potential for medium to longer-term growth through facility upgrades, product development, and branded products.\n\nIf the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue from operations would have been approximately US$370M and earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) approximately US$56M, prior to integration costs.\n\nDetails of the purchase consideration and net assets acquired for the acquisition is as follows:\n\n## (b)  Purchase consideration - cash outflow\n\n| Outflow of cash to acquire business, net of cash acquired   | Metal X LLC   | Metal X LLC   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                             | $M            | $M            |\n|                                                             | USD           | AUD           |\n| Purchase consideration  (1)                                 | 218.3         | 306.8         |\n| Add: Acquisition costs  (2)                                 | 1.9           | 2.7           |\n| Less: Deferred purchase consideration payable  (3)          | (20.0)        | (29.1)        |\n| Cash consideration                                          | 200.2         | 280.4         |\n| Less: Cash balances acquired                                | 0.1           | 0.1           |\n| Outflow of cash                                             | 200.1         | 280.3         |",

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates in the consolidated financial statements reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n## 25  Investment in joint ventures\n\n|                                        | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                        | 2022 $M        | 2021 $M        |\n| Interest in joint venture partnerships | 138.9          | 108.9          |\n\nThe Group has a 50% interest in Tata BlueScope Steel Ltd (TBSL), an Indian resident, the principal activity of which is to manufacture metallic coated and painted steel products.\n\n## (a)  Movements in carrying amounts\n\n|                                        | Tata BlueScope Steel   | Tata BlueScope Steel   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                        | 2022 $M                | 2021 $M                |\n| Carrying amount at beginning of year   | 108.9                  | 89.3                   |\n| Share of profit after income tax       | 29.3                   | 26.7                   |\n| Reserve movements                      | (3.1)                  | (0.2)                  |\n| Exchange fluctuations                  | 3.8                    | (6.9)                  |\n| Carrying amount at the end of the year | 138.9                  | 108.9                  |",

        "page_content": "## 25  Investment in joint ventures (continued)\n\n## (e)  Recognition and measurement\n\nJoint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the joint arrangements. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (\"joint operators\") have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (\"joint venturers\") have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nThe interests in joint ventures are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. Under the equity method, the share of the profits or losses of the partnerships is recognised in profit or loss, and the share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nProfits or losses on transactions establishing a joint venture and transactions with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's ownership interest until such time as they are realised by the joint venture partnership on consumption or sale. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.\n\n## UNRECOGNISED ITEMS\n\n## 26  Contingencies\n\n## (a)  Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group had contingent liabilities at 30 June 2022 in respect of:\n\n## (i) Outstanding legal matters\n\nAs announced to the market in August and October 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced civil proceedings against BlueScope and one of its former employees in the Federal Court of Australia in August 2019, alleging contraventions of the Australian competition law cartel provisions. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) determined not to commence criminal cartel proceedings against either BlueScope or the former employee.\n\nBlueScope has previously conducted an internal investigation in relation to all matters covered in the ACCC's Statement of Claim and remains of the view that neither BlueScope, nor any of its current or former employees referred to in the ACCC's Statement of Claim, engaged in cartel conduct, or attempted to engage in such conduct. The trial of the civil proceedings concluded on 1 November 2021 and judgment is reserved.\n\n## (ii) Guarantees\n\nIn Australia, BlueScope Steel Limited has provided $88.7M (2021: $88.9M) in guarantees to various state workers compensation authorities as a prerequisite for self-insurance. An amount, net of recoveries, of $58.9M (2021: $58.5M) has been recognised as recommended by independent actuarial advice.\n\nBank guarantees have been provided to customers and suppliers in respect of the performance of goods and services provided and purchases of goods and services which are immediately callable by default. Bank guarantees outstanding at 30 June 2022 totalled $143.8M (2021: $146.0M).\n\n## (iii) Taxation\n\nThe Group operates in many countries across the world, each with separate taxation authorities, which results in significant complexity. At any point in time there are tax computations which have been submitted but not agreed by those tax authorities and matters which are under discussion between Group companies and the tax authorities. The Group provides for the amount of tax it expects to pay taking into account those discussions and professional advice it has received. While conclusion of such matters may result in amendments to the original computations, the Group does not believe that such adjustments will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, although such adjustments may be significant to any individual year's income statement.\n\n## (iv) Regulatory\n\nThe Group is subject to extensive government laws and regulation, including environmental, greenhouse gas emissions, tax, occupational health and safety, competition law and trade restrictions in each of the countries in which it operates. The Group is also subject to risks posed by the conduct of our employees and other participants in the supply chain and to the risk of regulatory investigations into compliance with government laws and regulations which could be lengthy and costly.\n\n## (b)  Contingent assets\n\nThere are no material contingent assets required for disclosure as at 30 June 2022 (June 2021: Nil).",

        "page_content": "## 27  Events occurring after balance date\n\n(i) On 8 August 2022, the Company acquired a ferrous scrap processing business located in Ohio, U.S. for approximately US$80M. Given the close proximity of the acquisition to the financial statements signing date the required AASB 3 Business Combination disclosures cannot be made.\n\n(ii) The Board has approved an increase in the share buy-back program to allow up to $500M over the next 12 months. This reflects a $153M increase to the $347M available unused capacity as at 30 June 2022.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThis section of the notes includes information on items which require disclosure to comply with Australian Accounting Standards and other regulatory pronouncements but are not considered critical in understanding the financial performance or position of the\n\n## 28  Share-based payments\n\n## (a)  Share award schemes\n\n## (i)   STI share award\n\nThe Board approved the annual FY2022 STI for the CEO and executives, being a one year equity program. No amount will be paid in cash. Performance was assessed against a range of financial and other measures aligned with the returns delivered to shareholders from the implementation of initiatives under the Group's strategic plan. The share awards will vest in late August 2022.\n\n## (ii) Long Term Alignment Rights Plan (LTAR)\n\nThe long term alignment rights plan is a program determined annually by the Board, which awards share rights to eligible senior management of BlueScope Steel Limited. Alignment Rights are designed to build share ownership and reward senior management for long-term value creation, and are part of the Group's overall recognition and retention strategy. The share rights give the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria and continued employment with the Group.\n\nThe share rights available for exercise are contingent on the Group's achievement of a three-year rolling average level of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and debt leverage, as well as individual adherence to the BlueScope Bond. Share rights that fail to meet performance vesting conditions will lapse upon the Alignment Rights expiry date, or sooner upon employee resignation or termination. Plans have been granted to senior management, all at $Nil exercise price.\n\n## (iii) Deferred Equity / Retention Rights Award\n\nThe Board awarded deferred equity awards to senior management throughout the Group, with no performance hurdles required to be met. The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to continued employment with the Group.\n\n## (iv) Talent Retention Rights (TRE)\n\nDuring the year, the Board awarded Talent Retention equity rights to selected senior management.The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to maintaining personal performance ratings above the required level and continued employment with the Company.\n\n## (v) Non-Executive Director Salary Sacrifice Share Plan (NED)\n\nThe Board awarded a fee sacrifice plan to non-executive directors, designed to provide them the opportunity to acquire share rights through sacrificing a fixed portion of their fees covering periods of 6 months intervals. The share rights are being settled by an onmarket purchase of BlueScope Steel shares.\n\n## (b)  Fair value of share rights granted\n\nThe fair value of the share rights granted during the year ended 30 June 2022 are as follows:\n\n| Fair Value inputs                     | FY2022 STI   | FY2022 LTAR   | FY22 TRE   | FY2022 NED   plan\\_Tranche1 Tranche 1   | FY2022 NED   Tranche 2   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Grant date                            | 3-Dec-21     | 3-Dec-21      | 3-Dec-21   | 8-Apr-21                               | 8-Apr-21                 |\n| Vesting date                          | 30-Jun-22    | 30-Jun-24     | 31-Aug-23  | 31-Dec-21                              | 30-Jun-22                |\n| Share rights granted                  | 54,704       | 742,660       | 94,000     | 3,030                                  | 3,613                    |\n| Fair value estimate at grant date ($) | 20.08        | 19.08         | 19.57      | 20.39                                  | 20.30                    |\n| Cash settled rights (i)               | -            | 27,784        | 6,000      | -                                      | -                        |\n| Valuation date share price ($)        | 20.47        | 20.47         | 20.47      | 20.52                                  | 20.52                    |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)           | 2.57         | 2.57          | 2.57       | 0.88                                   | 0.88                     |\n| Expected risk-free interest rate (%)  | 0.66         | 0.9           | 0.66       | 0.08                                   | 0.08                     |\n| Expected share price volatility (%)   | 32.50        | 32.50         | 32.50      | 32.50                                  | 32.50                    |",

The amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards or share rights granted, which includes any market performance conditions but excludes the impact of non-market performance vesting conditions.\n\nThe fair value of equity settled awards at grant date is independently determined by an external valuer using Black-Scholes option pricing model that includes a Monte Carlo simulation analysis, which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the share right, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share right.\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards or share rights that are expected to vest. The expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are expected to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share awards and share rights that are expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects the extent to which the expected vesting period has expired and the number of rights that are expected to ultimately vest. This number is based on the best available information at the reporting date. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a performance condition not being met, except for share rights where vesting is only conditional upon a market condition. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date.\n\nUpon the exercise of equity settled share awards, the balance of the share-based payments reserve relating to those rights and awards is transferred to share capital. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding rights is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.",

The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities' financial statements.\n\nThe amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from BlueScope Steel Limited, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. BlueScope Steel Limited may require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly-owned entities in the case of a default by BlueScope Steel Limited. At balance date, the possibility of default is considered remote.\n\nThe tax consolidated group has applied the group allocation approach in determining the appropriate amount of current taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.

For the cash flow hedges relating to future commitments not recognised in the statement of financial position the effective portion of gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Otherwise they are being marked to market through the profit and loss in line with the Group's risk management strategy.\n\n## (ii)   Forward commodity contracts\n\nIn September 2019, the Group entered into a Gas Supply Agreement with Esso Australia for its Australian business from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025, with the contract price linked to Brent Oil in US dollars. Given exposure to a variable Brent Oil price, 95% of the first three year's exposure has been hedged. Both of these forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of gains and losses recognised directly in equity.",

The royalty period is for iron sand shipments made between years 2 and 11 from 1 May 2017. The royalty agreement ends on 10 May 2028.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the Platts index iron ore price, the historical volatility of iron ore prices, the credit worthiness of TMIL and production risk. The royalty was valued at US$7.9M as at 30 June 2022 (June 2021: US$9.6M). The royalty value is reassessed at each reporting date with any movement in the fair value of the derivative fair valued through the profit and loss and included in discontinued operations. Royalties received for the year was $6.0M (June 2021: $6.6M).\n\n## (iv)   Solar PPA\n\nThe Group entered into a solar power purchase agreement (PPA) in June 2018 for a period of seven years from the commencement of commercial production. The solar farm is situated in Finley NSW. The project was completed in two stages with Stage 1 involving the construction of an 88MW facility, completed in November 2019 and Stage 2 construction of an additional 45M, completed in February 2020. The Group's percentage offtake is equal to 100% of Stage 1 (or 66% of the total solar farm output). The Group has no involvement in financing, operating and maintaining the solar farm.\n\nThe PPA is not a physical electricity supply contract. It operates as a 'contract for differences' (CfD) whereby the parties have agreed to a 'strike price'. If the NSW electricity spot price is higher than the strike price then the solar farm will pay the difference to the company and vice versa if the spot price is lower than the strike price. The CfD is a derivative and is required to be fair valued at each reporting date with any movements recorded in the profit or loss.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the strike price, the contract period, forward NSW electricity spot prices (Level 3 unobservable input), future estimates of the Group's share of solar output and the credit worthiness of the service provider. The 30 June 2022 PPA derivative receivable was valued at $42.2M (June 2021: payable $12.8M). The fair value significantly increased due to higher forecast future spot electricity prices. The profit impact from a reasonably possible movement in spot electricity prices (+/- 10 %) is +/- $5.9M net of tax.\n\n## (e)  Fair values\n\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Group's financial instruments recognised in the financial statements are materially the same, with the exception of the following:\n\n|                                  | 2022                | 2022          | 2021                | 2021          |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                  | Carrying  amount $M | Fair value $M | Carrying  amount $M | Fair value $M |\n| Non-traded financial liabilities |                     |               |                     |               |\n| Other loans                      | 436.2               | 444.2         | 399.3               | 432.0         |\n| Net assets (liabilities)         | (436.2)             | (444.2)       | (399.3)             | (432.0)       |\n\nThe fair value of interest bearing financial liabilities where no market exists is based upon discounting the expected future cash flows by the current market interest rates on liabilities with similar risk profiles that are available to the Group (level 3).\n\n## Valuation of financial instruments\n\n- (i) Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- (ii) Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\n- (iii) Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).\n\nDerivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity forward contracts. These valuations reference forward pricing using present value calculations. The forward price incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. The fair value of forward commodity exchange contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are considered level 2 valuations (note 32(d)) and the commodity royalty option is considered level 3.",

The effectiveness of the derivatives in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items is assessed and documented on an ongoing basis.\n\n## (i)   Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in the profit or loss for hedges of recognised working capital items, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Cash flow hedges for forecast items are recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, whilst ineffective portions are recognised immediately in profit or loss within other income or other expenses.\n\nAmounts accumulated in the hedging reserve are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets) the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedging reserve are reclassified from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as cost of goods sold in the case of inventory, or as depreciation in the case of fixed assets.\n\n## (ii)  Net investment in foreign operations\n\nNet investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Gains and losses accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\n## (iii)   Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other income or other expenses.\n\n## (iv)    Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the hedging reserve is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.",

The Group's assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.\n\n## (i)  AASB 2020-1 Amendments to AASs- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (effective 1 July 2024)\n\nA liability is classified as current if the entity has no right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period. The AASB recently issued amendments to AASB 101 to clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. Specifically:\n\n- \u00b7  The amendments specify that the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period are those which will be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists.\n- \u00b7  Management intention or expectation does not affect classification of liabilities.\n- \u00b7  In cases where an instrument with a conversion option is classified as a liability, the transfer of equity instruments would constitute settlement of the liability for the purpose of classifying it as current or non-current.\n- \u00b7  Specifying that conditions with which an entity must comply after the reporting period do not affect the classification at the reporting date.\n- \u00b7  Adding presentation and disclosure requirements for non-current liabilities subject to conditions in the next 12 months.\n- \u00b7  Clarifying specific situations in which an entity does not have a right to defer settlements for at least 12 months after the reporting date.\n\nThe Group does not expect these amendments to have any significant impact on the Group's current classification of current and non-current liabilities.",

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\n## (ii)   Foreign operations\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, a proportionate share of such exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale where applicable.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entities and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## (d)  Other taxes\n\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case, it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.\n\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.",

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.",

Carrying value of property, plant & equipment (PPE) and intangible assets (including goodwill)\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAs required by Australian Accounting Standards the Group annually tests goodwill for impairment and tests other non-current assets where indicators of impairment or impairment reversals exist using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable value.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) with significant goodwill balances include North Star BlueScope Steel (goodwill balance of $1,130m), Coil Coaters North America (provisional goodwill balance of $558m) and Buildings North America (goodwill balance of $318m). The CGUs with a significant PPE balance are Australian Steel Products (PPE balance of $2,242m) and North Star BlueScope Steel (PPE balance of $1,819m).\n\nAn impairment reversal of $46m has been recorded during the period relating to PPE in the Building Products Thailand CGU that was previously impaired.\n\nThe carrying value of PPE and intangible assets, (including goodwill) was a key audit matter due to the significance of these balances, the complex judgements in the impairment assessment process such as forecast foreign exchange rates, steel, iron ore, coal pricing and domestic sales volumes that are affected by future market or economic conditions.\n\nThe Group's disclosures are included in Note 14 of the financial report, which specifically explain the key operating assumptions used; and sensitivity of changes in the key assumptions which could give rise to an impairment loss of the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) balance, or impairment reversal on previously impaired PPE balances, in the future.\n\nOur audit procedures included assessing the appropriateness of the Group's determination of its CGUs where impairment testing was performed, taking into consideration the levels at which management monitors business performance and the interdependency of cash flows.\n\nIn respect of the Group's cashflow forecasts, for relevant CGUs, where indicators of impairment or impairment reversal were present or in CGUs that contained significant goodwill balances as at 30 June 2022, we:\n\n- \uf084 Assessed key assumptions such as forecast steel, iron ore and coal pricing, foreign exchange rates and domestic sales volumes in comparison to external independent data where relevant\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's results in comparison to historical forecasts to assess forecast accuracy\n- \uf084 Compared future cash flows to board approved budgets\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's assumptions for long term growth rates in comparison to economic and industry forecasts\n- \uf084 Assessed the adequacy of capital expenditure forecasts\n- \uf084 Assessed discount rates through comparing the cost of capital for the Group with comparable businesses\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's assumptions related to climate change risks and capital expenditure and costs required to meet its committed decarbonisation plans\n- \uf084 Considered the EBITDA multiples against comparable companies as a valuation cross check\n- \uf084 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model.\n- \uf084 Assessed whether the required impairment reversal was appropriately recorded in the financial statements.\n\nWhere considered necessary, we performed a sensitivity analysis in respect of the assumptions noted above which were considered to have the most significant impact on carrying values, to ascertain the extent of changes in those assumptions which either individually or collectively would be required for the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) to be impaired, or for a previous impairment to be reversed where applicable. We assessed the likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures of those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill).",

Business Combinations\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOn 17 December 2021 the Group acquired the North American ferrous scrap recycling business of MetalX, for consideration of $307m. This business is now known as BlueScope Recycling. As a result of this acquisition a goodwill balance of $157m has been recognised.\n\nOn 28 June 2022, BlueScope acquired the Coil Coaters business in North America for consideration of $711m. As a result of this acquisition, a provisional goodwill balance of $545m has been recognised.\n\nAccounting for these transactions was complex, requiring judgement to be exercised to determine the provisional fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed.\n\nDisclosure in relation to these acquisitions can be found at Note 21 of the financial report.\n\nFor each of the acquisitions we performed the following procedures:\n\n- \uf084 Read the purchase agreements to gain an understanding of the key terms and conditions and assessed whether the appropriate accounting treatments applied were in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \uf084 Assessed the total consideration paid.\n\nWhere applicable, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we assessed the:\n\n- \uf084 Reasonableness of the valuation assumptions used by the Group's external experts in their determination of the provisional fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and the amount recognised as goodwill;\n- \uf084 Competence, qualifications and objectivity of the external experts;\n- \uf084 Recording of the provisional fair values in the financial report.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the related financial report disclosures included at Note 21.\n\n## Information other than the financial report and auditor's report thereon\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's 2022 annual report, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to ev ents or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financi al report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",
